Once more the year opens under royal auspices
and enjoys in fuller pride its famous prince; not
brooking to linger around private thresholds the
returning fasces rejoice in Caesar's consulship
Seest thou how the armed chiefs and mighty judges
don the raiment of senators? and the soldiers
step forth in garb of peaceful hue worn Gabine 1
wise, and laying aside for a season the standards
of war follow the banner of Quirinus. The eagles
give way to the lictors, the smiling soldier wears
the toga of peace and the senate-house casts
its brilliance in the midst of the camp. Bellona
herself, surrounded by a noble band of senators,
puts on the consul's gown and lays by her shield and
helmet in order to harness the sacred curule chair to
her shoulders. Think it no shame, Gradivus, to bear
the laurel-crowned axes in a hand of peace and to
exchange thy shining breastplate for the Latin
toga while thine iron chariot remains unused and
thy steeds disport them in the pastures of Eridanus.
</p>
         <p>Not unworthy of reverence nor but newly
acquainted with war is the family of Trajan and that
Spanish house which has showered diadems upon
the world. No common stream was held worthy
<pb id="v.1.p.289"/>
to water the homeland of so illustrious a race;
Ocean laved their cradle, for it befitted the future
lords of earth and sea to have their origin in the
great father 1 of all things. Hence came Theodosius,
grandfather of Honorius, for whom, exultant after
his northern victories, Africa twined fresh laurels
won from the Massylae. 'Twas he who pitched his
camp amid the snows of Caledonia, 2 who never
doffed his helmet for all the heat of a Libyan summer,
who struck terror into the Moors, brought into
subjection the coasts of Britain and with equal
success laid waste the north and the south. What
avail against him the eternal snows, the frozen air,
the uncharted sea? The Orcades ran red with
Saxon slaughter; Thule was warm with the blood
of Picts; ice-bound Hibernia wept for the heaps
of slain Scots. Could heat stay the advance of a
courageous general? No; he overran the deserts
of Ethiopia, invested Atlas with troops strange to
him, drank of lake Triton where was born the virgin
goddess Minerva, beheld the Gorgon's empoisoned
lair, and laughed to see the common verdure of
those gardens of the Hesperides which story had
clothed with gold. Juba's fortress was burned
down, the frenzied valour of the Moor yielded to
the sword and the palace of ancient Bocchus was
razed to the ground.
</p>
         <p>But thy father's fame far surpassed that of thy
grandsire: he subdued Ocean to his governance
and set the sky for border to his kingdom, ruling
from Gades to the Tigris, and all that lies 'twixt
Tanais and Nile; yet all these lands won by countless
triumphs of his own, he gained them not by gift
<pb id="v.1.p.291"/>
of birth or from lust of power. It was his own
merit secured his election. Unsought the purple
begged his acceptance of itself; he alone when asked
to rule was worthy to do so. For when unrest at
home drove barbarian hordes over unhappy Rhodope
and the now deserted north had poured its tribes
in wild confusion across our borders, when all the
banks of Danube poured forth battles and broad
Mysia rang beneath the chariots of the Getae, when
flaxen-haired hordes covered the plains of Thrace and
amid this universal ruin all was either prostrate or
tottering to its fall, one man alone withstood the tide
of disaster, quenched the flames, restored to the
husbandmen their fields and snatched the cities
from the very jaws of destruction. No shadow of
Rome's name had survived had not thy sire borne
up the tottering mass, succoured the storm-tossed
bark and with sure hand averted universal shipwreck.
</p>
         <p>As when the maddened coursers broke from
their path and carried Phaethon far astray, when
day's heat grew fierce and the sun's rays, brought
near to earth, dried up both land and sea, Phoebus
checked his fierce horses with his wonted voice;
for they knew once more their master's tones, and
with a happier guide heaven's harmonious order was
restored; for now the chariot again accepted government
and its fires control.
</p>
         <p>Thus was the East entrusted to him and thus was
its salvation assured; but the other half of the
world was not so entrusted: twice was the West
gained by valour, twice won by dangers. In those
lands of the sunset by manifold crime there arose
to power tyrants twain: wild Britain produced
one (Maximus), the other (Eugenius) was chosen
<pb id="v.1.p.293"/>
as a tool by a Frankish outlaw (Arbogast). Both
dared monstrous guilt; both stained their hands with
an innocent emperor's 1 blood. Sudden elevation
inspired Maximus with audacity, his failure taught
his successor caution. Maximus was quick to arm
rebellion, Eugenius careful to attempt only what
was safe. The one o'erran the country, spreading
his forces in all directions, the other kept his troops
together and himself secure behind a rampart.
</p>
         <p>Different were they, but in their deaths alike. To
neither was it granted to escape an ignominious end
and to fall in the thick of the fight. Gone was their
glory, their weapons were reft from them and they
reduced to their former state; their arms were
bound behind their backs and they stretched forth
their necks to the sword's imminent stroke, begging
for pardon and for life. What a fall did pride there
suffer! They who but lately had moved such
countless cohorts with but a nod, into whose palm
a wavering world had hung ready to drop, fall
not as warriors at a victor's hand but as malefactors
before a judge; he sentences with his voice as
criminals those whom he assailed in war as tyrants.
</p>
         <p>With both perished their lieutenants: Andragathius
hurled himself from his ship into the waves, Arbogast
took his life with his own sword; the Alps
mark the tomb of the one, the sea of the other.
</p>
         <p>This solace at least the avenger afforded to those murdered
brothers that both the authors of their deaths
themselves were slain; two victims went to appease
those royal ghosts. Such was Theodosius' oblation
at their tomb and with the blood of the guilty he
appeased the shades of the two young emperors.
</p>
         <p>Those triumphs stablished Justice on her throne
<pb id="v.1.p.295"/>
and taught that heaven gives help. From them
let the ages learn that righteousness need fear no
foe and guilt expect no safety. Himself his own
messenger, outstripping the rumour of his approach,
Theodosius traversed those long journeys undetected
by his enemies. Suddenly he fell on both, passing
over entrenched mountains as if they were a plain.
</p>
         <p>Build up monstrous rocks, raise towers, surround
yourselves with rivers, set limitless forests to protect
you, put Garganus and the snowy Apennines upon
the summits of the Alps that all form one vast mountain
barrier, plant Haemus on the crags of Caucasus,
roll Pelion on Ossa, yet will ye not gain security
for guilt. The avenger will come; for the better
cause all things shall sink to make a path.
</p>
         <p>Yet never did Theodosius forget that he and
the vanquished were fellow-citizens, nor was his
anger implacable against those who yielded. Not
his the choice to exult over the fallen. His ears
were open to prayers, his clemency unbounded, his
vengeance restrained. His anger did not survive
the war to darken the days of peace; the day that
set an end to the combat set an end to his wrath.
</p>
         <p>Capture by such a victor was a gain; and many a
conquered foe did their chains commend to future
fortune. 1 As liberal of money as of honours he
was ever bent to redress the injuries of fate.
</p>
         <p>Hence the love, the fortitude, the devotion of his
troops; hence their abiding loyalty to his sons.
</p>
         <p>Child of so noble a sire, thy kingly state was
coeval with thy birth nor ever knewest thou the
soilure of a private lot. To thee all things came
unsought; thee only 2 did a palace rear; thy happy
growth was in ancestral purple, and thy limbs, never
<pb id="v.1.p.297"/>
outraged by garb profane, were laid upon a hallowed
lap. Spain with its rivers of gold gave birth
to thy sire; Bosporus boasts thee among its children.
</p>
         <p>The West is the cradle of thy race but the East
was thine own nurse; rivals are they for so dear a
pledge, either hemisphere claims thee as its citizen.
</p>
         <p>The fame of Hercules and Bacchus has immortalized
Thebes; when Latona gave birth to Apollo in
Delos that island stayed its errant course; it is
Crete's boast that over its fields the infant Thunderer
crawled. But the land that brought divine Honorius
to birth is a greater than Delos, a more famous than
Crete. Such narrow shores would not suffice our
god. Nor did the bleak rocks of Cynthus hurt thy
body with their rough bed; on couch of gold,
clothed in jewelled raiment, thy mother gave birth
to thee amid Tyrian purples; a palace rang with
joy at that royal deliverance. What presages were
there not then of future prosperity? what songs of
birds, what flights of good omen in the heavens?
</p>
         <p>What was the hurrying to and fro of seers? Hornèd
Ammon and Delphi so long dumb at length broke
their silence; Persian magi prophesied thy triumphs;
Tuscan augurs felt thine influence; seers of Babylon
beheld the stars and trembled; amazement seized
the Chaldaean priests; the rock of Cumae, shrine
of raging Sibyl, thundered once again. Cybele's
corybants surrounded not thy cradle with the clatter
of their brazen shields; a shining host stood by
thee on every side. Standards of war hedged in
the royal babe who marked the bowed helmets of
the worshipping soldiery while the trumpet's blare
answered his warlike cries.
</p>
         <p>The day that gave thee birth gave thee a kingdom;
<pb id="v.1.p.299"/>
in thy cradle thou wast raised to the consulship.1
With the name so recently bestowed upon thee thou
dowerest the fasti and the year wherein thou wert born
is consecrated to thee. Thy mother herself wrapped
thy small form in the consular robe and directed thy
first steps to the curule chair. Nourished at a
goddess' breasts, honoured with the embraces of immortal
arms thou grewest to maturity. Oft to grace
thy boyish form Diana hung upon thy shoulders her
Maenalian bow and huntress' quiver; oft thou didst
sport with Minerva's shield and, crawling unharmed
over her glittering aegis, didst caress its friendly
serpents with fearless hand. Often even in those
early days thy mother beneath thy sire's happy
gaze crowned thy tender locks and, anticipating the
answer to her prayers, gave thee the diadem that
was to be thine hereafter; then raising thee in her
gentle arms she held thee up to receive thy mighty
father's kiss. Nor was that honour long in coming;
thou, then Caesar, didst become emperor and
wert straightway made equal with thy brother.2
Never was the encouragement of the gods more
sure, never did heaven attend with more favouring
omens. Black tempest had shrouded the light in
darkness and the south wind gathered thick rainclouds,
when of a sudden, so soon as the soldiers had
borne thee aloft with customary shout, Phoebus
scattered the clouds and at the same moment was
given to thee the sceptre, to the world light. Bosporus,
freed from clouds, permits a sight of Chalcedon
on the farther shore; nor is it only the vicinity of
Byzantium that is bathed in brightness; the clouds
are driven back and all Thrace is cleared; Pangaeus
shows afar and lake Maeotis makes quiver the rays he
<pb id="v.1.p.301"/>
rarely sees. 'Tis not Boreas nor yet Phoebus' warmer
breath that has put the mists to flight. That light
was an emperor's star. A prophetic radiance was
over all things, and with thy brightness Nature
laughed. Even at midday did a wondering people
gaze upon a bold star ('twas clear to behold) — no
dulled nor stunted beams but bright as Boötes'
nightly lamp. At a strange hour its brilliance lit up
the sky and its fires could be clearly seen though
the moon lay hid. May be it was the Queen
mother's star or the return of thy grandsire's now
become a god, or may be the generous sun agreed
to share the heavens with all the stars that hasted
to behold thee. The meaning of those signs
is now unmistakable. Clear was the prophecy of
Ascanius' coming power when an aureole crowned
his locks, yet harmed them not, and when the fires
of fate encircled his head and played about his
temples.1 Thy future the very fires of heaven
foretell. So the young Jove, issuing from the caves
of Ida, stood upon the summit of the conquered sky
and received the homage of the gods whom Nature
handed to his charge. The bloom of youth had
not yet clothed his cheeks nor flowed there o'er his
neck the curls whose stirrings were to shake the
world. He was yet learning how to cleave the clouds
and hurl the thunderbolt with unpractised hand.
</p>
         <p>Gladdened by that augury and proud of his now
equal sons the sire returned, upstayed on the two
princes and lovingly embracing his children in
glittering car. Even so the Spartan twins, the
sons of Leda, sit with highest Jove; in each his
brother is mirrored, in each their sister; round each
alike flows a golden dress, and star-crowned are the
<pb id="v.1.p.303"/>
locks of both. The Thunderer rejoices in his very
uncertainty, and to their hesitating mother her
ignorance brings delight; Eurotas cannot make
distinction between his own nurslings.
</p>
         <p>When all had returned to the palace, Theodosius,
anxious for the world's just governance, is said to
have addressed thee in these terms:
<q direct="unspecified">
               <p>Had fortune, my dear son, given thee the throne
of Parthia, hadst thou been a descendant of the
Arsacid house and did the tiara, adored by Eastern
lands afar, tower upon thy forehead, thy long
lineage would be enough, and thy birth alone would
protect thee, though wantoning in idle luxury. Very
different is the state of Rome's emperor. 'Tis merit,
not blood, must be his support. Virtue hidden hath
no value, united with power 'tis both more effective
and more useful. Nay, o'erwhelmed in darkness it
will no more advantage its obscure possessor than
a vessel with no oars, a silent lyre, an unstrung bow.
</p>
               <p>Yet virtue none shall find that has not first learned
to know himself and stilled the uncertain waves of
passion within him. Long and winding is the path
that leads thereto. What each man learns in his
own interests learn thou in the interests of the
world. When Prometheus mixed earthly and
heavenly elements and so formed human kind, he
stole man's spirit pure from his own heavenly home,
held it imprisoned and bound despite its outcries,
and since humanity could be formed in no other way
he added two more souls.1 These fail and perish
with the body; the first alone remains, survives
the pyre and flies away. This soul he stationed in
the lofty fastness of the brain to control and oversee
the work and labours of the body. The other
<pb id="v.1.p.305"/>
two he set below the neck in a place befitting their
functions, where it is their part to obey the commands
of the directing soul. Doubtless our creator,
fearing to mix the heavenly with the mortal, placed
the different souls in different parts and kept their
dwelling-places distinct. Near to the heart whence
springs our blood there is within the breast a place
where fiery anger lurks, eager to hurt and uncontrolled.
This cavity swells when heated by rage
and contracts when cooled by fear. Then, since
anger swept everything away with it and in its fury
gave the limbs no rest, Prometheus invented the
lungs to aid the body and applied their humidity
to the raging of anger to soothe our wrath-swollen
flesh. Lust, that asks for everything and gives
nought, was driven down into the liver and of necessity
occupied the lowest room. Like a beast, opening
its capacious jaws, lust can never be full fed nor
satisfied; it is a prey now to the cruel lash of sleepless
avarice, now to the fiery goads of love; is
swayed now by joy, now by misery, and is no sooner
fed than fain to be fed again, returning with more
insistence than the oft-beheaded hydra.
</p>
               <p>Can any assuage this tumult he will assure an
inviolable sanctuary for a spotless soul. Thou
mayest hold sway o'er farthest India, be obeyed by
Mede, unwarlike Arab or Chinese, yet, if thou
fearest, hast evil desires, art swayed by anger,
thou wilt bear the yoke of slavery; within thyself
thou wilt be a slave to tyrannical rule. When thou
canst be king over thyself then shalt thou hold
rightful rule over the world. The easier way often
trod leads to worse; liberty begets licence and,
when uncontrolled, leads to vice. Then is a chaste
<pb id="v.1.p.307"/>
life harder when love is at call; then is it a sterner
task to govern anger when vengeance is to hand.
Yet master thine emotions and ponder not what
thou mightest do but what thou oughtest to do,
and let regard for duty control thy mind.
</p>
               <p>Of this too I cannot warn thee too often: remember
that thou livest in the sight of the whole world,
to all peoples are thy deeds known; the vices of
monarchs cannot anywhere remain hid. The splendour
of their lofty station allows nought to be concealed;
fame penetrates every hiding-place and
discovers the inmost secrets of the heart.
</p>
               <p>Above all fail not in loving-kindness; for though
we be surpassed in every virtue yet mercy alone
makes us equal with the gods. Let thine actions be
open and give no grounds for suspicion, be loyal to
thy friends nor lend an ear to rumours. He who
attends to such will quake at every idle whisper and
know no moment's peace. Neither watch nor guard
nor yet a hedge of spears can secure thee safety;
only thy people's love can do that. Love thou
canst not extort; it is the gift of mutual faith and
honest goodwill. Seest thou not how the fair frame
of the very universe binds itself together by love,
and how the elements, not united by violence, are
for ever at harmony among themselves? Dost
thou not mark how that Phoebus is content not to
outstep the limits of his path, nor the sea those of
his kingdom, and how the air, which in its eternal
embrace encircles and upholds the world, presses not
upon us with too heavy a weight nor yet yields to the
burden which itself sustains? Whoso causes terror
is himself more fearful; such doom befits tyrants.
Let them be jealous of another's fame, murder the
<pb id="v.1.p.309"/>
brave, live hedged about with swords and fenced
with poisons, dwelling in a citadel that is ever
exposed to danger, and threaten to conceal their
fears. Do thou, my son, be at once a citizen and
a father, consider not thyself but all men, nor let
thine own desires stir thee but thy people's.
</p>
               <p>If thou make any law or establish any custom for
the general good, be the first to submit thyself
thereto; then does a people show more regard for
justice nor refuse submission when it has seen their
author obedient to his own laws. The world shapes
itself after its ruler's pattern, nor can edicts sway
men's minds so much as their monarch's life; the
unstable crowd ever changes along with the prince.
</p>
               <p>Nor is this all: show no scorn of thine inferiors
nor seek to overstep the limits established for mankind.
Pride joined thereto defaces the fairest
character. They are not submissive Sabaeans whom
I have handed over to thy rule, nor have I made
thee lord of Armenia; I give thee not Assyria,
accustomed to a woman's rule. Thou must govern
Romans who have long governed the world, Romans
who brooked not Tarquin's pride nor Caesar's
tyranny. History still tells of our ancestors' ill
deeds; the stain will never be wiped away. So
long as the world lasts the monstrous excesses of
the Julian house will stand condemned. Will any
not have heard of Nero's murders or how Capri's
foul cliffs were owned by an aged lecher 1? The
fame of Trajan will never die, not so much because,
thanks to his victories on the Tigris, conquered
Parthia became a Roman province, not because he
brake the might of Dacia and led their chiefs in
triumph up the slope of the Capitol, but because
<pb id="v.1.p.311"/>
he was kindly to his country. Fail not to make
such as he thine example, my son.
</p>
               <p>Should war threaten, see first that thy soldiers
are exercised in the practices of war and prepare
them for the rigours of service. The ease of winter
months spent in winter quarters must not weaken
nor unnerve their hands. Establish thy camps in
healthy places and see that watchful sentries guard
the ramparts. Learn how to know when to mass
your troops and when it is better to extend them or
face them round; study the formations suitable for
mountain warfare and those for fighting on the plain.
Learn to recognize what valleys may conceal an
ambush and what routes will prove difficult. If
thine enemy trusts in his walls to defend him then
let thy catapults hurl stones at his battlements;
fling rocks thereat and let the swinging ram and
shield-protected testudo 1 shake his gates. Your
troops should undermine the walls and issuing from
this tunnel should rush into the town. Should a
long siege delay thee, then take care thou unbend
not thy purpose in security or count thine enemy
thy prisoner. Many ere this have found premature
triumph their undoing, scattered or asleep they
have been cut to pieces; indeed victory itself has
not seldom been the ruin of careless troops. Not
for thee let spacious tents o'erflow with princely
delights nor luxury don arms and drag to the standards
her unwarlike train. Though the storm winds blow
and the rain descends yield not to them and use not
cloth of gold to guard thee from the sun's fierce rays.
Eat such food as thou canst find. It will be a solace
to thy soldiers that thy toil is as heavy as theirs;
be the first to mount the arduous hill and, should
<pb id="v.1.p.313"/>
necessity demand the felling of a forest, be not
ashamed to grasp the axe and hew down the oak.
If a stagnant marsh must be crossed let thy horse
be the first to test the depth of it. Boldly tread
the frozen river; swim the flood. Mounted thyself,
ride amid thy squadrons of horse or again stand foot
to foot with the infantry. They will advance the bolder
for thy presence, and with thee to witness glorious
and glad shall be the fulfilment of their task.</p>
            </q>
         </p>
         <p>More would he have spoken but Honorius broke in
and said: <q direct="unspecified">All this will I do, so God favour my
attempts. The peoples and kingdoms committed to
my care shall find me not unworthy of thee nor of my
brother. But why should I not experience in action
what thou has taught in words? Thou goest to the
wintry Alps: take me with thee. Let mine arrows
pierce the tyrant's body, and the barbarians pale at
my bow. Shall I allow Italy to become the prey of
a ruthless bandit? Rome to serve one who is himself
but a servant? Am I still such a child that neither
power profaned nor just revenge for an uncle's blood
shall move me? Fain would I ride through blood.
Quick, give me arms. Why castest thou my youth
in my teeth? Why thinkest me unequal to the
combat? I am as old as was Pyrrhus when alone he
o'erthrew Troy and proved himself no degenerate
from his father Achilles. If I may not remain in thy
camp as a prince I will come even as a soldier.</q>
         </p>
         <p>Theodosius kissed his son's sweet lips and answered
him wondering: <q direct="unspecified">
               <p>Nought have I but praise for thy
petition, but this love of glory has bloomed too early.
Thy strength will increase with years; till then be
patient. Though thou hast not yet completed ten
summers thou wouldst hansel dangers that a man
<pb id="v.1.p.315"/>
might fear: I mark the tokens of a noble nature.
It is said that Alexander, conqueror of eastern
Porus, wept at the constant news of Phihp's fortune,
telling his companions who rejoiced thereat that his
sire's valour left him nought to conquer. In thee
I see like spirit. May a father be allowed this
prophecy — <q direct="unspecified">thou shalt be as great</q>! It is not to
my goodwill thou owest the kingdom, for nature
has already made it thine. So even from his birth
bees reverence the king 1 who is to lead their
buzzing swarms through the soft meadows, ask his
public laws for the gathering of the honey and
entrust to him their combs. So the spirited young
bull-calf claims sovereignty over the grazing-grounds
and, though as yet his horns are not grown strong,
lords it over the herd. Nay: postpone thy campaigns
till thou art a man and while I do battle
patiently help thy brother to fulfil my office. Be
you two the terror of untamed Araxes and of swift
Euphrates; may Nile throughout all his length
belong to you and all the lands upon which the
morning sun lets fall his beam. Should I force a
passage over the Alps, should success crown the
juster cause, thou shalt come and govern the recovered
provinces, whereby fierce Gaul shall obey
thy laws and my native Spain be guided by thy
just rule. Then, careless of doom and rejoicing in
my labours, I shall quit this mortal life, while you,
my sons, rule either hemisphere.
</p>
               <p>Meanwhile cultivate the Muses whilst thou art
yet young; read of deeds thou soon mayest rival;
never may Greece's story, never may Rome's, cease
to speak with thee. Study the lives of the heroes
of old to accustom thee for wars that are to be.

Go back to the Latin age. Admirest thou a fight
for liberty? Thou wilt admire Brutus. Does
treachery rouse thine indignation? The punishment
of Mettius 1 will fill thee with satisfaction. Dost
thou hate undue severity? Abominate Torquatus'
savagery. Is it a virtue to die for one's country?
Honour the self-devotion of the Decii. Horatius
Codes, facing the foe on the broken bridge, Mucius
holding his arm in the flames, 2 these shall show
thee what, single-handed, brave men can do.
Fabius will show thee what overthrow delay can
cause; Camillus and his slaughter of the Gauls
what in face of odds a leader can effect. From
history thou mayest learn that no ill fortune can
master worth; Punic savagery extends thy fame,
Regulus, to eternity; the failure of Cato outdoes
success. From history thou mayest learn the power
of frugal poverty; Curius was a poor man when
he conquered kings in battle; Fabricius was poor
when he spurned the gold of Pyrrhus; Serranus,
for all he was dictator, drove the muddy plough. In
those days the lictors kept watch at a cottage door,
the fasces were hung upon a gateway of wood;
consuls helped to gather in the harvest, and for long
years the fields were ploughed by husbandmen who
wore the consular robe.</p>
            </q>
         </p>
         <p>Such were the precepts of the sire. Even so an
aged helmsman oft proved by winter's various storms,
aweary now of the sea and his weight of years,
commends to his son the rudder of his bark, tells him
of dangers and devices — by what art the helmsman's
hand is guided; what steerage may elude
the wave; what is a sign of storms; what the
treachery of a cloudless sky, the promise of the
<pb id="v.1.p.319"/>
setting sun; what storm-wind frets the Moon so that
discoloured she uplifts an angry face. Behold now,
great father, in whatsoever part of heaven thou
shinest, be it the southern arch or the cold constellation
of the Plough that has won the honour of
thy presence; see, thy prayer has been answered;
thy son now equals thee in merit, nay, a consummation
still more to be desired, he surpasseth thee,
thanks to the support of thy dear Stilicho whom thou
thyself at thy death didst leave to guard and defend
the brothers twain. For us there is nought that
Stilicho is not ready to suffer, no danger to himself
he is not willing to face, neither hardships of the
land nor hazards of the sea. His courage will
carry him on foot across the deserts of Libya, at
the setting of the rainy Pleiads his ship will penetrate
the Gaetulian Syrtes.
</p>
         <p>To him, however, thy first command is to calm
fierce nations and bring peace to the Rhine. On
wind-swift steed, no escort clinging to his side,
he crosses the cloud-capped summits of the
Raetian Alps, and, so great is his trust in himself,
approaches the river unattended. Then
mightest thou have seen from source to mouth
come hastening up Rhine's princes, bending their
heads in fearful submission. Before our general the
Sygambri abased their flaxen locks and the Franks
cast themselves upon the ground and sued with
trembling voice for pardon. Germany swears allegiance
to the absent Honorius and addresses her suppliant
prayers to him. Fierce Bastarnae were there
and the Bructeri who dwell in the Hercynian forest.
</p>
         <p>The Cimbrians left their broad marsh-lands, the tall
Cherusci came from the river Elbe. Stilicho listens
<pb id="v.1.p.321"/>
to their various prayers, gives tardy assent to their
entreaties and of his great bounty bestows upon
them peace. A covenant with Germany gave glory
to the Drusi of old, but purchased by what uncertain
warfare, by how many disasters! Who can
recall the Rhine conquered by terror alone? That
which others were enabled to win by long wars —
this, Honorius, Stilicho's mere march gives thee.
</p>
         <p>Thou biddest Stilicho after restoring peace in
Gaul save Greece from ruin. Vessels cover the
Ionian sea; scarce can the wind fill out so many
sails. Neptune with favouring currents attends the
fleet that is to save Corinth, and young Palaemon,
so long an exile from the shores of his isthmus,
returns in safety with his mother to the harbour.
</p>
         <p>The blood of barbarians washes their wagons; the
ranks of skin-clad warriors are mowed down, some by
disease, some by the sword. The glades of Lycaeus,
the dark and boundless forests of Erymanthus, are
not enough to furnish such countless funeral pyres;
Maenalus rejoices that the axe has stripped her of her
woods to provide fuel for such a holocaust. Let
Ephyre 1 rise from her ashes while Spartan and Arcadian,
now safe, tread under foot the heaps of slain;
let Greece's sufferings be made good and her weary
land be allowed to breathe once more. That nation,
wider spread than any that dwells in northern
Scythia, that found Athos too small and Thrace too
narrow when it crossed them, that nation, I say,
was conquered by thee and thy captains, and now,
in the persons of the few that survive, laments its
own overthrow. One hill now shelters a people whose
hordes scarce the whole world could once contain.
</p>
         <p>Athirst and hemmed within their rampart they
<pb id="v.1.p.323"/>
sought in vain for the stolen waters, that, once
within our foemen's reach, Stilicho had turned aside
in another course, and commanded the stream, that
marvelled at its strange channel amid unknown
ways, to shift its altered track.
</p>
         <p>What wonder that the nations barring thy path
should fall before thee, since the barbarian of his
own choice now seeks to serve thee? The Sarmatae,
ever a prey to internal strife, beg to swear allegiance
to thee; the Geloni cast off their cloaks of hide and
fight for thee; you, O Alans, have adopted the
customs of Latium. As thou choosest for war men
that are brave and eager for the fray, so thou choosest
for the offices of peace men that are just, and once
chosen keepest them long in their charge, not
ousting them by ever new successors. We know
the magistrates who govern us, and we enjoy the
blessings of peace while we reap the advantages
of war, as though we lived at one and the same
time in the reign of warlike Romulus and peace-
loving Numa. A sword is no longer hung over
our heads; there are no massacres of the great;
gone is the mob of false accusers; no melancholy
exiles are driven from their fatherland. Unholy
increase of perpetual taxes is at an end; there are
no accursed lists,1 no auctions of plundered wealth;
the voice of greed summons not the salesman, nor
is thy treasury increased by private losses. Thou
art liberal with thy money, yet not wasteful of it.
</p>
         <p>The loyalty of thy soldiers is a lasting loyalty,
for it is not bought, nor is it gifts that win their love;
the army is anxious for the success of its own child
and loves thee who wast its nursling.
</p>
         <p>And how deep is thy devotion to Rome herself I
<pb id="v.1.p.325"/>
THE FOURTH CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS

How fixed abides thy reverence for the Senate!
</p>
         <p>Old customs are preserved, law has recovered its
ancient sanctity in the amendment of former statutes
and by the addition of new ones. Such an one as
thee Pandion's city 1 found in Solon; even so did
warrior Lacedaemon disdain walls, for unyielding
Lycurgus gave it defence. What case so petty,
what judicial error so slight that it escapes thy
notice? Who with truer justice put an end to
dishonest suits and brought forth lurking truth
from her hiding-place? What mercy, yet what
firmness; thine is the quiet strength of a great soul,
too firm to be stirred by fear, too stable to be swayed
by the attraction of novelty. How stored with
learning thy ready wit, how controlled thy speech;
ambassadors are awe-stricken at thine answers, and
thy grave manners make them forget thy years.
</p>
         <p>How thy father's nobility shines in thy face!
</p>
         <p>How awful is thy winning brow, how charming
the majesty of a blushing emperor! Boy though
thou art, thou canst wear thy sire's helmet and
brandish thy grandsire's spear. These exercises
of thy youth foreshadow vast strength in manhood
and convince Rome that the ruler of her
prayers is come. How fair art thou in shield and
golden armour girt, with waving plumes and taller
by the altitude of a helmet! So looked the youthful
Mars when after the toil and sweat of his first battle
he bathed him in Thracian Rhodope's mountain
stream. With what vigour thou hurlest the javelin,
and, when thou stretchest the Cretan bow, what
success attends thy shaft! Sure is the wound it
seeks; it knows not how to fail the appointed
stroke. Thou knowest in what fashion the Cretan,
<pb id="v.1.p.327"/>
with what skill the Armenian, directs his arrows;
in what the retreating Parthian puts his trust.
</p>
         <p>Thus was Alcides, graced with the sweat of the
wrestling-ground at Thebes, wont to try his bow
and Boeotian arrows on the beasts of the forest ere
he turned them against the Giants and so secured
peace for heaven. Stains of blood were ever upon
him and proud was his mother Alcmena of the spoils
he brought back home. Such was Apollo when he
slew the livid serpent that enfolded and brake down
forests in his dying coils.
</p>
         <p>When mounted on thy horse thou playest the
mimicry of war, who is quicker smoothly to wheel in
flight, who to hurl the spear, or more skilled to sweep
round in swift return? There the Massagetae are not
thy peers nor the tribes of Thessaly, well versed
though they be in riding, no, nor the very Centaurs
themselves. Scarce can the squadrons and flying
bands that accompany thee keep pace, while the wind
behind thee bellies the fierce dragons on the flags.
</p>
         <p>So soon as the touch of thy spur has fired thy steed,
flames start from his swelling nostrils; his hoof
scarce touches the ground and his mane is outspread
over his shoulders. His harness rattles and the
golden bit grows warm in his foam-flecked mouth.
</p>
         <p>The jewels that stud his quivering bridle are red with
blood. The signs of toil, the dust stains, the disorder
of thy hair all do but increase thy beauty. Thy
brilliant scarlet cloak drinks in the sunlight as
the wind blows its gay surface into folds. Could
horses choose their riders then surely would Arion,
full fed in the stables of the Nereids, have prayed
for the very whip of such a master, Cyllarus would
have had none of Castor, but would have looked
<pb id="v.1.p.329"/>
to thy reins for guidance and Xanthus have scorned
to bear golden-haired Achilles. Pegasus himself
had lent thee his subject wings and been glad to
carry thee and, now that a mightier rider bestrode
him, had turned in proud disdain from Bellerophon's
bridle. Nay, Aethon, swift messenger of
dawn, who routs the stars with his neigh and is
driven by rosy Lucifer, seeing thee from heaven as
thou ridest by, is filled with envy and would choose
rather to hold thy bit in his foaming mouth.
</p>
         <p>What raiment, too, have we not seen, what
miracles of splendour, when, girt with the robe of
Italy, thou didst go, still more glorious than thou
art wont, through the peoples of Liguria, borne
aloft amid thy troops clad, in triumphal white and
carried upon the shoulders of chosen warriors who
so proudly upheld their godlike burden! 'Tis thus
that Egypt brings forth her gods to the public gaze.
</p>
         <p>The image issues from its shrine; small it is, indeed,
yet many a linen-clad priest pants beneath the pole,
and by his sweat testifies that he bears a god;
Nile's banks resound to the holy rattles, and Egypt's
pipe drones its native measure; Apis abases his
horns and lows in reply. All the nobles, all whom
Tiber and Latium rear, throng thy festival; gathered
in one are all the great ones of the earth that owe
their rank either to thee or to thy sire. Many
a consular surrounds thee, the consul whose good
pleasure it is to associate the senate in thy triumph.
</p>
         <p>The nobles of Spain, the wise men of Gaul, and the
senators of Rome all throng round thee. On young
men's necks is borne thy golden throne, and new
adorning adds weight to deity. Jewels of India
stud thy vestment, rows of green emeralds enrich
<pb id="v.1.p.331"/>
the seams; there gleams the amethyst and the
glint of Spanish gold makes the dark-blue sapphire
show duller with its hidden fires. Nor in the weaving
of such a robe was unadorned beauty enough; the
work of the needle increases its value, thread of
gold and silver glows therefrom; many an agate
adorns the embroidered robes, and pearls of Ocean
breathe in varied pattern. What bold hand, what
distaff had skill enough to make thus supple elements
so hard? What loom so cunning as to weave jewels
into close-textured cloth? Who, searching out the
uncharted pools of hot Eastern seas, despoiled the
bosom of Tethys? Who dared seek o'er burning
sands rich growth of coral? Who could broider
precious stones on scarlet and so mingle the shining
glories of the Red Sea and of Phoenicia's waters?
</p>
         <p>Tyre lent her dyes, China her silks, Hydaspes his
jewels. Shouldst thou traverse Maeonian cities in
such a garb, to thee would Lydia hand over her
vine-wreathed thyrsus, to thee Nysa her dances;
the revels of Bacchus would have doubted whence
came their madness; tigers would pass fawning
beneath thy yoke. Even such, his fawn-skin en-
woven with orient gems, doth the Wine-god drive his
car, guiding the necks of Hyrcanian tigers with ivory
yoke; around him satyrs and wild-haired Maenads
fetter Indians with triumphant ivy, while drunken
Ganges twines his hair with the vine tendril.
</p>
         <p>Already shouts of joy and of good omen resound
about the consul's throne to welcome this thy fourth
opening of Rome's year. Liberty enacts her wonted
ceremonies; Law observes the custom dating back
to Vindex 1 whereby a slave freed from his master's
service is introduced into thy presence and thence
<pb id="v.1.p.333"/>
dismissed — a freeman thanks to that envied stroke.1
A blow upon the brow and his base condition is
gone; reddened cheeks have made him a citizen,
and with the granting of his prayer a happy insult
has given his back freedom from the lash.
</p>
         <p>Prosperity awaits our empire; thy name is earnest
for the fulfilment of our hopes. The past guarantees
the future; each time that thy sire made thee chief
magistrate of the year the laurels of victory crowned
his arms. Once the Gruthungi, hewing down a
forest to make them boats, dared to pass beyond
the Danube. Three thousand vessels, each crowded
with a barbarous crew, made a dash across the river.
</p>
         <p>Odothaeus was their leader. Thy youth, nay, the
first year of thy life, crushed the attempt of that
formidable fleet. Its boats filled and sank; never
did the fish of that northern river feed more lavishly
on the bodies of men. The island of Peuce was
heaped high with corpses. Scarce even through
five mouths could the river rid itself of barbarian
blood, and thy sire, owning thine influence, gave
thanks to thee for the spoils won in person from
King Odothaeus. Consul a second time thou didst
end civil war by thine auspices. Let the world
thank thee for the overthrow of the Gruthungi and
the defeat of their king; thou wast consul when the
Danube ran red with their blood, thou wast consul,
too, when thy sire crossed the Alps to victory. 2
But thou, once author of thy father's successes,
shalt now be author of thine own. Triumph has ever
attended thy consulship and victory thy fasces.
<pb id="v.1.p.335"/>
Heaven grant thou mayest be our perpetual consul
and outnumber Marius 1 and old Augustus. Happy
universe that shall see the first down creep over thy
cheeks, and the wedding-night that shall lead forth
for thee the festal torches. Who shall be consecrated
to such a couch; who, glorious in purple, shall
pass, a queen, to the embraces of such a husband?
</p>
         <p>What bride shall come to be the daughter of so
many gods, dowered with every land and the whole
sea? How gloriously shall the nuptial song be
borne at once to farthest East and West! O may
it be mine to sing thy marriage-hymn, mine presently
to hail thee father! The time will come
when, thou victorious beyond the mouths of the
Rhine, and thy brother Arcadius laden with the
spoil of captured Babylon, ye shall endow the year
with yet more glorious majesty; when the long-
haired Suebian shall bear the aims of Rome and
the distant Bactrian tremble beneath the rule of
thyself and thy brother.
