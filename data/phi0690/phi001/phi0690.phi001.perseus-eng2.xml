               <l n="2">reclining, on the slender oat rehearse</l>
               <l n="3">your silvan ditties: I from my sweet fields,</l>
               <l n="4">and home's familiar bounds, even now depart.</l>
               <l n="5">Exiled from home am I; while, Tityrus, you</l>
               <l n="6">sit careless in the shade, and, at your call,</l>

               <l n="8">O Meliboeus, 'twas a god vouchsafed</l>
               <l n="9">this ease to us, for him a god will I</l>
               <l n="10">deem ever, and from my folds a tender lamb</l>
               <l n="11">oft with its life-blood shall his altar stain.</l>
               <l n="12">His gift it is that, as your eyes may see,</l>
               <l n="13">my kine may roam at large, and I myself</l>
               <l n="14">play on my shepherd's pipe what songs I will.</l>

               <l n="16">such wide confusion fills the country-side.</l>
               <l n="17">See, sick at heart I drive my she-goats on,</l>
               <l n="18">and this one, O my Tityrus, scarce can lead:</l>
               <l n="19">for 'mid the hazel-thicket here but now</l>
               <l n="20">she dropped her new-yeaned twins on the bare flint,</l>
               <l n="21">hope of the flock—an ill, I mind me well,</l>
               <l n="22">which many a time, but for my blinded sense,</l>
               <l n="23">the thunder-stricken oak foretold, oft too</l>
               <l n="24">from hollow trunk the raven's ominous cry.</l>
               <l n="25">But who this god of yours? Come, Tityrus, tell.</l>

               <l n="27">I, simpleton, deemed like this town of ours,</l>
               <l n="28">whereto we shepherds oft are wont to drive</l>
               <l n="29">the younglings of the flock: so too I knew</l>
               <l n="30">whelps to resemble dogs, and kids their dams,</l>
               <l n="31">comparing small with great; but this as far</l>
               <l n="32">above all other cities rears her head</l>
               <l n="33">as cypress above pliant osier towers.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
               <l n="35">Freedom, which, though belated, cast at length</l>
               <l n="36">her eyes upon the sluggard, when my beard</l>
               <l n="37">'gan whiter fall beneath the barber's blade—</l>
               <l n="38">cast eyes, I say, and, though long tarrying, came,</l>
               <l n="39">now when, from Galatea's yoke released,</l>
               <l n="40">I serve but Amaryllis: for I will own,</l>
               <l n="41">while Galatea reigned over me, I had</l>
               <l n="42">no hope of freedom, and no thought to save.</l>
               <l n="43">Though many a victim from my folds went forth,</l>
               <l n="44">or rich cheese pressed for the unthankful town,</l>
               <l n="45">never with laden hands returned I home.</l>

               <speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
               <l n="46">I used to wonder, Amaryllis, why</l>
               <l n="47">you cried to heaven so sadly, and for whom</l>
               <l n="48">you left the apples hanging on the trees;</l>
               <l n="49">'twas Tityrus was away. Why, Tityrus,</l>
               <l n="50">the very pines, the very water-springs,</l>
               <l n="51">the very vineyards, cried aloud for you.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
               <l n="52">What could I do? how else from bonds be freed,</l>
               <l n="53">or otherwhere find gods so nigh to aid?</l>
               <l n="54">There, Meliboeus, I saw that youth to whom</l>
               <l n="55">yearly for twice six days my altars smoke.</l>
               <l n="56">There instant answer gave he to my suit,</l>
               <l n="57">“Feed, as before, your kine, boys, rear your bulls.”</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
               <l n="58">So in old age, you happy man, your fields</l>
               <l n="59">will still be yours, and ample for your need!</l>
               <l n="60">Though, with bare stones o'erspread, the pastures all</l>
               <l n="61">be choked with rushy mire, your ewes with young</l>
               <l n="62">by no strange fodder will be tried, nor hurt</l>
               <l n="63">through taint contagious of a neighbouring flock.</l>
               <l n="64">Happy old man, who 'mid familiar streams</l>
               <l n="65">and hallowed springs, will court the cooling shade!</l>
               <l n="66">Here, as of old, your neighbour's bordering hedge,</l>
               <l n="67">that feasts with willow-flower the Hybla bees,</l>
               <l n="68">shall oft with gentle murmur lull to sleep,</l>
               <l n="69">while the leaf-dresser beneath some tall rock</l>
               <l n="70">uplifts his song, nor cease their cooings hoarse</l>
               <l n="71">the wood-pigeons that are your heart's delight,</l>
               <l n="72">nor doves their moaning in the elm-tree top.</l>

               <speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
               <l n="73">Sooner shall light stags, therefore, feed in air,</l>
               <l n="74">the seas their fish leave naked on the strand,</l>
               <l n="75">germans and Parthians shift their natural bounds,</l>
               <l n="76">and these the <placeName key="tgn,1084764">Arar</placeName>, those the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName> drink,</l>

               <l n="82">Ah! shall I ever in aftertime behold</l>
               <l n="83">my native bounds—see many a harvest hence</l>
               <l n="84">with ravished eyes the lowly turf-roofed cot</l>

               <l n="88">has civil discord brought our hapless folk!</l>
               <l n="89">For such as these, then, were our furrows sown!</l>

               <l n="94">hang from the bushy rock; my songs are sung;</l>
               <l n="95">never again will you, with me to tend,</l>

            <l n="1">the shepherd Corydon with love was fired</l>
            <l n="2">for fair Alexis, his own master's joy:</l>
            <l n="3">no room for hope had he, yet, none the less,</l>
            <l n="4">the thick-leaved shadowy-soaring beech-tree grove</l>
            <l n="5">still would he haunt, and there alone, as thus,</l>
            <l n="6">to woods and hills pour forth his artless strains.</l>
            <l n="7">“Cruel Alexis, heed you naught my songs?</l>
            <l n="8">Have you no pity? you'll drive me to my death.</l>
            <l n="9">Now even the cattle court the cooling shade</l>
            <l n="10">and the green lizard hides him in the thorn:</l>
            <l n="11">now for tired mowers, with the fierce heat spent,</l>
            <l n="12">pounds Thestilis her mess of savoury herbs,</l>
            <l n="13">wild thyme and garlic. I, with none beside,</l>
            <l n="14">save hoarse cicalas shrilling through the brake,</l>
            <l n="15">still track your footprints 'neath the broiling sun.</l>
            <l n="16">Better have borne the petulant proud disdain</l>
            <l n="17">of Amaryllis, or Menalcas wooed,</l>
            <l n="18">albeit he was so dark, and you so fair!</l>
            <l n="19">Trust not too much to colour, beauteous boy;</l>
            <l n="20">white privets fall, dark hyacinths are culled.</l>
            <l n="21">You scorn me, Alexis, who or what I am</l>
            <l n="22">care not to ask—how rich in flocks, or how</l>
            <l n="23">in snow-white milk abounding: yet for me</l>
            <l n="24">roam on Sicilian hills a thousand lambs;</l>
            <l n="25">summer or winter, still my milk-pails brim.</l>
            <l n="26">I sing as erst Amphion of Circe sang,</l>
            <l n="27">what time he went to call his cattle home</l>
            <l n="28">on Attic Aracynthus. Nor am I</l>
            <l n="29">so ill to look on: lately on the beach</l>
            <l n="30">I saw myself, when winds had stilled the sea,</l>
            <l n="31">and, if that mirror lie not, would not fear</l>
            <l n="32">daphnis to challenge, though yourself were judge.</l>
            <l n="33">Ah! were you but content with me to dwell.</l>
            <l n="34">Some lowly cot in the rough fields our home,</l>
            <l n="35">shoot down the stags, or with green osier-wand</l>
            <l n="36">round up the straggling flock! There you with me</l>
            <l n="37">in silvan strains will learn to rival Pan.</l>
            <l n="38">Pan first with wax taught reed with reed to join;</l>

            <l n="47">Ay, and two fawns, I risked my neck to find</l>
            <l n="48">in a steep glen, with coats white-dappled still,</l>
            <l n="49">from a sheep's udders suckled twice a day—</l>

            <l n="55">plucking pale violets and poppy-heads,</l>
            <l n="56">now the fair Naiad, of narcissus flower</l>
            <l n="57">and fragrant fennel, doth one posy twine—</l>

            <l n="59">blends them, and sets the tender hyacinth off</l>

            <l n="73">Whom do you fly, infatuate? gods ere now,</l>

            <l n="75">Let Pallas keep the towers her hand hath built,</l>
            <l n="76">us before all things let the woods delight.</l>
            <l n="77">The grim-eyed lioness pursues the wolf,</l>

            <l n="79">in wanton sport the flowering cytisus,</l>
            <l n="80">and Corydon Alexis, each led on</l>
            <l n="81">by their own longing. See, the ox comes home</l>
            <l n="82">with plough up-tilted, and the shadows grow</l>
            <l n="83">to twice their length with the departing sun,</l>
            <l n="84">yet me love burns, for who can limit love?</l>
            <l n="85">Ah! Corydon, Corydon, what hath crazed your wit?</l>
            <l n="86">Your vine half-pruned hangs on the leafy elm;</l>
            <l n="87">why haste you not to weave what need requires</l>
            <l n="88">of pliant rush or osier? Scorned by this,</l>
            <l n="89">elsewhere some new Alexis you will find.”</l>

            <head>TO VARUS</head>
            <l n="1">first my Thalia stooped in sportive mood</l>
            <l n="2">to Syracusan strains, nor blushed within</l>
            <l n="3">the woods to house her. When I sought to tell</l>
            <l n="4">of battles and of kings, the Cynthian god</l>
            <l n="5">plucked at mine ear and warned me: “Tityrus,</l>
            <l n="6">beseems a shepherd-wight to feed fat sheep,</l>
            <l n="7">but sing a slender song.” Now, Varus, I—</l>
            <l n="8">for lack there will not who would laud thy deeds,</l>
            <l n="9">and treat of dolorous wars—will rather tune</l>
            <l n="10">to the slim oaten reed my silvan lay.</l>
            <l n="11">I sing but as vouchsafed me; yet even this</l>
            <l n="12">if, if but one with ravished eyes should read,</l>
            <l n="13">of thee, O Varus, shall our tamarisks</l>
            <l n="14">and all the woodland ring; nor can there be</l>
            <l n="15">a page more dear to Phoebus, than the page</l>
            <l n="16">where, foremost writ, the name of Varus stands.</l>
            <lg>
               <l n="17">Speed ye, Pierian Maids! Within a cave</l>
               <l n="18">young Chromis and Mnasyllos chanced to see</l>
               <l n="19">silenus sleeping, flushed, as was his wont,</l>
               <l n="20">with wine of yesterday. Not far aloof,</l>
               <l n="21">slipped from his head, the garlands lay, and there</l>
               <l n="22">by its worn handle hung a ponderous cup.</l>
               <l n="23">Approaching—for the old man many a time</l>
               <l n="24">had balked them both of a long hoped-for song—</l>
               <l n="25">garlands to fetters turned, they bind him fast.</l>
               <l n="26">Then Aegle, fairest of the Naiad-band,</l>
               <l n="27">aegle came up to the half-frightened boys,</l>

               <l n="37">and stubborn oaks their branchy summits bow.</l>
               <l n="38">Not Phoebus doth the rude Parnassian crag</l>

               <l n="40">of Rhodope or Ismarus: for he sang</l>
               <l n="41">how through the mighty void the seeds were driven</l>
               <l n="42">of earth, air, ocean, and of liquid fire,</l>
               <l n="43">how all that is from these beginnings grew,</l>
               <l n="44">and the young world itself took solid shape,</l>
               <l n="45">then 'gan its crust to harden, and in the deep</l>
               <l n="46">shut Nereus off, and mould the forms of things</l>
               <l n="47">little by little; and how the earth amazed</l>
               <l n="48">beheld the new sun shining, and the showers</l>
               <l n="49">fall, as the clouds soared higher, what time the woods</l>
               <l n="50">'gan first to rise, and living things to roam</l>
               <l n="51">scattered among the hills that knew them not.</l>
               <l n="52">Then sang he of the stones by Pyrrha cast,</l>
               <l n="53">of Saturn's reign, and of Prometheus' theft,</l>
               <l n="54">and the Caucasian birds, and told withal</l>

               <l n="56">the mariners cried on Hylas till the shore</l>
               <l n="57">then re-echoed “Hylas, Hylas!” soothed</l>
               <l n="58">pasiphae with the love of her white bull—</l>
               <l n="59">happy if cattle-kind had never been!—</l>
               <l n="60">o ill-starred maid, what frenzy caught thy soul</l>
               <l n="61">the daughters too of Proetus filled the fields</l>
               <l n="62">with their feigned lowings, yet no one of them</l>
               <l n="63">of such unhallowed union e'er was fain</l>
               <l n="64">as with a beast to mate, though many a time</l>
               <l n="65">on her smooth forehead she had sought for horns,</l>
               <l n="66">and for her neck had feared the galling plough.</l>
               <l n="67">O ill-starred maid! thou roamest now the hills,</l>
               <l n="68">while on soft hyacinths he, his snowy side</l>
               <l n="69">reposing, under some dark ilex now</l>
               <l n="70">chews the pale herbage, or some heifer tracks</l>
               <l n="71">amid the crowding herd. Now close, ye Nymphs,</l>
               <l n="72">ye Nymphs of Dicte, close the forest-glades,</l>
               <l n="73">if haply there may chance upon mine eyes</l>
               <l n="74">the white bull's wandering foot-prints: him belike</l>
               <l n="75">following the herd, or by green pasture lured,</l>
               <l n="76">some kine may guide to the Gortynian stalls.</l>
               <l n="77">Then sings he of the maid so wonder-struck</l>
               <l n="78">with the apples of the Hesperids, and then</l>
               <l n="79">with moss-bound, bitter bark rings round the forms</l>
               <l n="80">of Phaethon's fair sisters, from the ground</l>
               <l n="81">up-towering into poplars. Next he sings</l>
               <l n="82">of Gallus wandering by Permessus' stream,</l>
               <l n="83">and by a sister of the Muses led</l>
               <l n="84">to the Aonian mountains, and how all</l>
               <l n="85">the choir of Phoebus rose to greet him; how</l>
               <l n="86">the shepherd Linus, singer of songs divine,</l>
               <l n="87">brow-bound with flowers and bitter parsley, spake:</l>

               <l n="6">and say, “Be off, you former husbandmen!</l>
               <l n="7">These fields are mine.” Now, cowed and out of heart,</l>

            <l n="1">This now, the very latest of my toils,</l>
            <l n="2">vouchsafe me, Arethusa! needs must I</l>
            <l n="3">sing a brief song to Gallus—brief, but yet</l>
            <l n="4">such as Lycoris' self may fitly read.</l>
            <l n="5">Who would not sing for Gallus? So, when thou</l>
            <l n="6">beneath Sicanian billows glidest on,</l>
            <l n="7">may Doris blend no bitter wave with thine,</l>
            <l n="8">begin! The love of Gallus be our theme,</l>
            <l n="9">and the shrewd pangs he suffered, while, hard by,</l>
            <l n="10">the flat-nosed she-goats browse the tender brush.</l>
            <l n="11">We sing not to deaf ears; no word of ours</l>
            <l n="12">but the woods echo it. What groves or lawns</l>
            <l n="13">held you, ye Dryad-maidens, when for love—</l>
            <l n="14">love all unworthy of a loss so dear—</l>
            <l n="15">Gallus lay dying? for neither did the slopes</l>

            <l n="17">no, nor Aonian Aganippe. Him</l>
            <l n="18">even the laurels and the tamarisks wept;</l>
            <l n="19">for him, outstretched beneath a lonely rock,</l>
            <l n="20">wept pine-clad Maenalus, and the flinty crags</l>
            <l n="21">of cold Lycaeus. The sheep too stood around—</l>
            <l n="22">of us they feel no shame, poet divine;</l>
            <l n="23">nor of the flock be thou ashamed: even fair</l>
            <l n="24">Adonis by the rivers fed his sheep—</l>
            <l n="25">came shepherd too, and swine-herd footing slow,</l>
            <l n="26">and, from the winter-acorns dripping-wet</l>
            <l n="27">Menalcas. All with one accord exclaim:</l>

            <l n="29">“Gallus, art mad?” he cried, “thy bosom's care</l>
            <l n="30">another love is following.” Therewithal</l>
            <l n="31">Silvanus came, with rural honours crowned;</l>
            <l n="32">the flowering fennels and tall lilies shook</l>
            <l n="33">before him. Yea, and our own eyes beheld</l>
            <l n="34">pan, god of Arcady, with blood-red juice</l>
            <l n="35">of the elder-berry, and with vermilion, dyed.</l>
            <l n="36">“Wilt ever make an end?” quoth he, “behold</l>
            <l n="37">love recks not aught of it: his heart no more</l>
            <l n="38">with tears is sated than with streams the grass,</l>
            <l n="39">bees with the cytisus, or goats with leaves.”</l>
            <l n="40">“Yet will ye sing, Arcadians, of my woes</l>
            <l n="41">upon your mountains,” sadly he replied—</l>
            <l n="42">“Arcadians, that alone have skill to sing.</l>

            <l n="63">I will depart, re-tune the songs I framed</l>
