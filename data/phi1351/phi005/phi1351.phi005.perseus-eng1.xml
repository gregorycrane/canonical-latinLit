<head>BOOK 1</head>
<head><dateRange from="14" to="15">A.D. 14, 15</dateRange></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p><rs type="placename">ROME</rs> at the beginning was ruled by kings. Freedom and 
the consulship were established by <name type="person">Lucius Brutus</name>. Dictatorships were held 
for a temporary crisis. The power of the decemvirs did not last beyond two 
years, nor was the consular jurisdiction of the military tribunes of long 
duration. The despotisms of <name type="person">Cinna</name> and <name type="person">Sulla</name> were brief; the rule of <name type="person">Pompeius</name> 
and of <name type="person">Crassus</name> soon yielded before <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>; the arms of <name type="person">Lepidus</name> and 
<name type="person">Antonius</name> before <name type="person">Augustus</name>; who, when the world was wearied by civil strife, 
subjected it to empire under the title of "Prince." But the successes and 
reverses of the old Roman people have been recorded by famous historians; 
and fine intellects were not wanting to describe the times of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, till 
growing sycophancy scared them away. The histories of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, <name type="person">Caius</name>, 
<name type="person">Claudius</name>, and <name type="person">Nero</name>, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, 
and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred. 
Hence my purpose is to relate a few facts about <name type="person">Augustus</name>&mdash;more 
particularly his last acts, then the reign of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and all which 
follows, without either bitterness or partiality, from any motives to which 
I am far removed.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>When after the 
destruction of <name type="person">Brutus</name> and <name type="person">Cassius</name> there was no longer any army of the 
Commonwealth, when <name type="person">Pompeius</name> was crushed in <rs type="placename">Sicily</rs>, 
and when, with <name type="person">Lepidus</name> pushed aside and <name type="person">Antonius</name> slain, even the <placeName key="tgn,2075295">Julian</placeName> 
faction had only <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> left to lead it, then, dropping the title of 
triumvir, and giving out that he was a Consul, and was satisfied with a 
tribune's authority for the protection of the people, <name type="person">Augustus</name>

won 
over the soldiers with gifts, the populace with cheap corn, and all men with 
the sweets of repose, and so grew greater by degrees, while he concentrated 
in himself the functions of the Senate, the magistrates, and the laws. He 
was wholly unopposed, for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle, or in 
the proscription, while the remaining nobles, the readier they were to be 
slaves, were raised the higher by wealth and promotion, so that, aggrandised 
by revolution, they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous 
past. Nor did the provinces dislike that condition of affairs, for they 
distrusted the government of the Senate and the people, because of the 
rivalries between the leading men and the rapacity of the officials, while 
the protection of the laws was unavailing, as they were continually deranged 
by violence, intrigue, and finally by corruption.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p><name type="person">Augustus</name> meanwhile, as supports to his despotism, raised to the 
pontificate and curule &aelig;dileship <name type="person">Claudius Marcellus</name>, his sister's son, 
while a mere stripling, and <name type="person">Marcus Agrippa</name>, of humble birth, a good soldier, 
and one who had shared his victory, to two consecutive consulships, and as 
<name type="person">Marcellus</name> soon afterwards died, he also accepted him as his son-in-law. 
<name type="person">Tiberius Nero</name> and <name type="person">Claudius Drusus</name>, his stepsons, he honoured with imperial 
titles, although his own family was as yet undiminished. For he had admitted 
the children of <name type="person">Agrippa</name>, <name type="person">Caius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius</name>, into the house of the 
C&aelig;sars; and before they had yet laid aside the dress of boyhood he had 
most fervently desired, with an outward show of reluctance, that they should 
be entitled "princes of the youth," and be consuls-elect. When <name type="person">Agrippa</name> died, 
and <name type="person">Lucius C&aelig;sar</name> as he was on his way to our armies in <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>, and <name type="person">Caius</name> while returning from <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, still suffering from a wound, were prematurely 
cut off by destiny, or by their step-mother <name type="person">Livia</name>'s treachery, <name type="person">Drusus</name> too 
having long been dead, <name type="person">Nero</name> remained alone of the stepsons, and in him 
everything tended to centre. He was adopted as a son, as a colleague in 
empire and a partner in the tribunitian power, and paraded through all the 
armies, no longer through his mother's secret intrigues, but at her open 
suggestion. For she had gained such a hold on the aged Augustus that he 
drove out as an exile into the island of <rs type="placename">Planasia</rs>, 
his only grandson, <name type="person">Agrippa Postumus</name>,
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CHARACTER OF AUGUSTAN 
RULE</note> 
who, though devoid of worthy qualities, and having only 
the brute courage of physical strength, had not been convicted of any gross 
offence. And yet <name type="person">Augustus</name> had appointed <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, <name type="person">Drusus</name>'s offspring, to 
the command of eight legions on the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, and 
required <name type="person">Tiberius</name> to adopt him, although <name type="person">Tiberius</name> had a son, now a young 
man, in his house; but he did it that he might have several safeguards to 
rest on. He had no war at the time on his hands except against the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, 
which was rather to wipe out the disgrace of the loss of <name type="person">Quintilius Varus</name> 
and his army than out of an ambition to extend the empire, or for any 
adequate recompense. At home all was tranquil, and there were magistrates 
with the same titles; there was a younger generation, sprung up since the 
victory of <rs type="placename">Actium</rs>, and even many of the older men had been born during the 
civil wars. How few were left who had seen the republic!</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>Thus the State had been revolutionised, and there was 
not a vestige left of the old sound morality. Stript of equality, all looked 
up to the commands of a sovereign without the least apprehension for the 
present, while <name type="person">Augustus</name> in the vigour of life, could maintain his own 
position, that of his house, and the general tranquillity. When in advanced 
old age, he was worn out by a sickly frame, and the end was near and new 
prospects opened, a few spoke in vain of the blessings of freedom, but most 
people dreaded and some longed for war. The popular gossip of the large 
majority fastened itself variously on their future roasters. "<name type="person">Agrippa</name> was 
savage, and had been exasperated by insult, and neither from age nor 
experience in affairs was equal to so great a burden. <name type="person">Tiberius Nero</name> was of 
mature years, and had established his fame in war, but he had the old 
arrogance inbred in the Claudian family, and many symptoms of a cruel 
temper, though they were repressed, now and then broke out. He had also from 
earliest infancy been reared in an imperial house; consulships and triumphs 
had been heaped on him in his younger days; even in the years which, on the 
pretext of seclusion he spent in exile at <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs>, he 
had had no thoughts but of wrath, hypocrisy, and secret sensuality. There 
was his mother too with a woman's caprice. They must, it seemed, be subject 
to a female and to two striplings besides, who

for a while would 
burden, and some day rend asunder the State."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>While these and like topics were discussed, the infirmities of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> increased, and some suspected guilt on his wife's part. For a 
rumour had gone abroad that a few months before he had sailed to <rs type="placename">Planasia</rs> on a visit to <name type="person">Agrippa</name>, with the knowledge of 
some chosen friends, and with one companion, <name type="person">Fabius Maximus</name>; that many tears 
were shed on both sides, with expressions of affection, and that thus there 
was a hope of the young man being restored to the home of his grandfather. 
This, it was said, <name type="person">Maximus</name> had divulged to his wife <name type="person">Marcia</name>, she again to 
<name type="person">Livia</name>. All was known to <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, and when <name type="person">Maximus</name> soon afterwards died, 
by a death some thought to be self-inflicted, there were heard at his 
funeral wailings from <name type="person">Marcia</name>, in which she reproached herself for having 
been the cause of her husband's destruction. Whatever the fact was, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
as he was just entering <rs type="placename">Illyria</rs> was summoned home by 
an urgent letter from his mother, and it has not been thoroughly ascertained 
whether at the city of <rs type="placename">Nola</rs> he found <name type="person">Augustus</name> still 
breathing or quite lifeless. For <name type="person">Livia</name> had surrounded the house and its 
approaches with a strict watch, and favourable bulletins were published from 
time to time, till, provision having been made for the demands of the 
crisis, one and the same report told men that <name type="person">Augustus</name> was dead and that 
<name type="person">Tiberius Nero</name> was master of the State.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>The first crime of the new reign was the murder of <name type="person">Postumus Agrippa</name>. Though 
he was surprised and unarmed, a centurion of the firmest resolution 
despatched him with difficulty. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> gave no explanation of the matter 
to the Senate; he pretended that there were directions from his father 
ordering the tribune in charge of the prisoner not to delay the slaughter of 
<name type="person">Agrippa</name>, whenever he should himself have breathed his last. Beyond a doubt, 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> had often complained of the young man's character, and had thus 
succeeded in obtaining the sanction of a decree of the Senate for his 
banishment. But he never was hard-hearted enough to destroy any of his 
kinsfolk, nor was it credible that death was to be the sentence of the 
grandson in order that the stepson might feel secure. It was more probable 
that <name type="person">Tiberius</name>
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">ACCESSION OF TIBERIUS</note> 
and <name type="person">Livia</name>, the 
one from fear, the other from a stepmother's enmity, hurried on the 
destruction of a youth whom they suspected and hated. When the centurion 
reported, according to military custom, that he had executed the command, 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> replied that he had not given the command, and that the act must be 
justified to the Senate.</p>
<p>As soon as <name type="person">Sallustius Crispus</name> who shared the 
secret (he had, in fact, sent the written order to the tribune) knew this, 
fearing that the charge would be shifted on himself, and that his peril 
would be the same whether he uttered fiction or truth, he advised <name type="person">Livia</name> not 
to divulge the secrets of her house or the counsels of friends, or any 
services performed by the soldiers, nor to let <name type="person">Tiberius</name> weaken the strength 
of imperial power by referring everything to the Senate, for "the 
condition," he said, "of holding empire is that an account cannot be 
balanced unless it be rendered to one person."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>Meanwhile at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> people plunged into 
slavery&mdash;consuls, senators, knights. The higher a man's rank, the more 
eager his hypocrisy, and his looks the more carefully studied, so as neither 
to betray joy at the decease of one emperor nor sorrow at the rise of 
another, while he mingled delight and lamentations with his flattery. <name type="person">Sextus 
Pompeius</name> and <name type="person">Sextus Apuleius</name>, the consuls, were the first to swear 
allegiance to <name type="person">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</name>, and in their presence the oath was taken 
by <name type="person">Seius Strabo</name> and <name type="person">Caius Turranius</name>, respectively the commander of the 
pr&aelig;torian cohorts and the superintendent of the corn supplies. Then 
the Senate, the soldiers and the people did the same. For <name type="person">Tiberius</name> would 
inaugurate everything with the consuls, as though the ancient constitution 
remained, and he hesitated about being emperor. Even the proclamation by 
which he summoned the senators to their chamber, he issued merely with the 
title of Tribune, which he had received under <name type="person">Augustus</name>. The wording of the 
proclamation was brief, and in a very modest tone. "He would," it said, 
"provide for the honours due to his father, and not leave the lifeless body, 
and this was the only public duty he now claimed."</p>
<p>As soon, however, as 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> was dead, he had given the watchword to the pr&aelig;torian 
cohorts, as commander-in-chief.

He had the guard under arms, with 
all the other adjuncts of a court; soldiers attended him to the forum; 
soldiers went with him to the <rs type="placename">Senate House</rs>. He sent letters to the different 
armies, as though supreme power was now his, and showed hesitation only when 
he spoke in the Senate. His chief motive was fear that <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, who had 
at his disposal so many legions, such vast auxiliary forces of the allies, 
and such wonderful popularity, might prefer the possession to the 
expectation of empire. He looked also at public opinion, wishing to have the 
credit of having been called and elected by the State rather than of having 
crept into power through the intrigues of a wife and a dotard's adoption. It 
was subsequently understood that he assumed a wavering attitude, to test 
likewise the temper of the nobles. For he would twist a word or a look into 
a crime and treasure it up in his memory.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>On the first day of the Senate he allowed nothing to be discussed 
but the funeral of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, whose will, which was brought in by the Vestal 
Virgins, named as his heirs <name type="person">Tiberius</name> and <name type="person">Livia</name>. The latter was to be 
admitted into the <placeName key="tgn,2075295">Julian</placeName> family with the name of <name type="person">Augusta</name>; next in 
expectation were the grand and great-grandchildren. In the third place, he 
had named the chief men of the State, most of whom he hated, simply out of 
ostentation and to win credit with posterity. His legacies were not beyond 
the scale of a private citizen, except a bequest of forty-three million five 
hundred thousand sesterces "to the people and populace of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>," of one thousand to every pr&aelig;torian soldier, 
and of three hundred to every man in the legionary cohorts composed of Roman 
citizens.</p>
<p>Next followed a deliberation about funeral honours. Of these 
the most imposing were thought fitting. The procession was to be conducted 
through "the gate of triumph," on the motion of <name type="person">Gallus Asinius</name>; the titles 
of the laws passed, the names of the nations conquered by <name type="person">Augustus</name> were to 
be borne in front, on that of <name type="person">Lucius Arruntius</name>. <name type="person">Messala Valerius</name> further 
proposed that the oath of allegiance to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> should be yearly renewed, 
and when <name type="person">Tiberius</name> asked him whether it was at <emph>his</emph> bidding that he had 
brought forward this motion, he replied that he had proposed it spontaneously,
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FUNERAL OF AUGUSTUS</note> 
 and that in whatever 
concerned the State he would use only his own discretion, even at the risk 
of offending. This was the only style of adulation which yet remained. The 
Senators unanimously exclaimed that the body ought to be borne on their 
shoulders to the funeral pile. The emperor left the point to them with 
disdainful moderation, and he then admonished the people by a proclamation 
not to indulge in that tumultuous enthusiasm which had distracted the 
funeral of the Divine <name type="person">Julius</name>, or express a wish that <name type="person">Augustus</name> should be 
burnt in the <rs type="placename">Forum</rs> instead of in his appointed resting-place in the <rs type="placename">Campus 
Martius</rs>. </p><p>On the day of the funeral soldiers stood round as a guard, amid 
much ridicule from those who had either themselves witnessed or who had 
heard from their parents of the famous day when slavery was still something 
fresh, and freedom had been resought in vain, when the slaying of 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, the Dictator, seemed to some the vilest, to others, the most 
glorious of deeds. "Now," they said, "an aged sovereign, whose power had 
lasted long, who had provided his heirs with abundant means to coerce the 
State, requires forsooth the defence of soldiers that his burial may be 
undisturbed."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Then followed much talk 
about <name type="person">Augustus</name> himself, and many expressed an idle wonder that the same day 
marked the beginning of his assumption of empire and the close of his life, 
and, again, that he had ended his days at <rs type="placename">Nola</rs> in 
the same house and room as his father <name type="person">Octavius</name>. People extolled too the 
number of his consulships, in which he had equalled <name type="person">Valerius Corvus</name> and 
<name type="person">Caius Marius</name> combined, the continuance for thirty-seven years of the 
tribunitian power, the title of Imperator twenty-one times earned, and his 
other honours which had been either frequently repeated or were wholly new. 
Sensible men, however, spoke variously of his life with praise and censure. 
Some said "that dutiful feeling towards a father, and the necessities of the 
State in which laws had then no place, drove him into civil war, which can 
neither be planned nor conducted on any right principles. He had often 
yielded to <name type="person">Antonius</name>, while he was taking vengeance on his father's 
murderers, often also to <name type="person">Lepidus</name>. When the latter sank into feeble dotage 
and the former had been ruined by his profligacy, the only remedy for his 
distracted

country was the rule of a single man. Yet the State had 
been organized under the name neither of a kingdom nor a dictatorship, but 
under that of a prince. The ocean and remote rivers were the boundaries of 
the empire; the legions, provinces, fleets, all things were linked together; 
there was law for the citizens; there was respect shown to the allies. The 
capital had been embellished on a grand scale; only in a few instances had 
he resorted to force, simply to secure general tranquillity."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>It was said, on the other hand, "that filial duty 
and State necessity were merely assumed as a mask. It was really from a lust 
of sovereignty that he had excited the veterans by bribery, had, when a 
young man and a subject, raised an army, tampered with the Consul's legions, 
and feigned an attachment to the faction of <name type="person">Pompeius</name>. Then, when by a decree 
of the Senate he had usurped the high functions and authority of 
Pr&aelig;tor, when <name type="person">Hirtius</name> and <name type="person">Pansa</name> were slain&mdash;whether they were 
destroyed by the enemy, or <name type="person">Pansa</name> by poison infused into a wound, <name type="person">Hirtius</name> by 
his own soldiers and <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s treacherous machinations&mdash;he at once 
possessed himself of both their armies, wrested the consulate from a 
reluctant Senate, and turned against the State the arms with which he had 
been intrusted against <name type="person">Antonius</name>. Citizens were proscribed, lands divided, 
without so much as the approval of those who executed these deeds. Even 
granting that the deaths of <name type="person">Cassius</name> and of the Bruti were sacrifices to a 
hereditary enmity (though duty requires us to waive private feuds for the 
sake of the public welfare), still <name type="person">Pompeius</name> had been deluded by the phantom 
of peace, and <name type="person">Lepidus</name> by the mask of friendship. Subsequently, <name type="person">Antonius</name> had 
been lured on by the treaties of <rs type="placename">Tarentum</rs> and <rs type="placename">Brundisium</rs>, and by his 
marriage with the sister, and paid by his death the penalty of a treacherous 
alliance. No doubt, there was peace after all this, but it was a peace 
stained with blood; there were the disasters of <name type="person">Lollius</name> and <name type="person">Varus</name>, the 
murders at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> of the Varros, Egnatii, and 
Juli."</p>
<p>The domestic life too of <name type="person">Augustus</name> was not spared. "<name type="person">Nero</name>'s wife had 
been taken from him, and there had been the farce of consulting the 
pontiffs, whether, with a child conceived and not yet born, she could 
properly marry. There were the
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">COMMENTS OF POPULACE</note> 

excesses of <name type="person">Quintus Tedius</name> and <name type="person">Vedius Pollio</name>; last of all, there was <name type="person">Livia</name>, 
terrible to the State as a mother, terrible to the house of the C&aelig;sars 
as a stepmother. No honour was left for the gods, when <name type="person">Augustus</name> chose to be 
himself worshipped with temples and statues, like those of the deities, and 
with flamens and priests. He had not even adopted <name type="person">Tiberius</name> as his successor 
out of affection or any regard to the State, but, having thoroughly seen his 
arrogant and savage temper, he had sought glory for himself by a contrast of 
extreme wickedness." For, in fact, <name type="person">Augustus</name>, a few years before, when he was 
a second time asking from the Senate the tribunitian power for <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
though his speech was complimentary, had thrown out certain hints as to his 
manners, style, and habits of life, which he meant as reproaches, while he 
seemed to excuse. However, when his obsequies had been duly performed, a 
temple with a religious ritual was decreed him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>After this all prayers were addressed to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. He, on his 
part, urged various considerations, the greatness of the empire, his 
distrust of himself. "Only," he said, "the intellect of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> 
was equal to such a burden. Called as he had been by him to share his 
anxieties, he had learnt by experience how exposed to fortune's caprices was 
the task of universal rule. Consequently, in a state which had the support 
of so many great men, they should not put everything on one man, as many, by 
uniting their efforts would more easily discharge public functions." There 
was more grand sentiment than good faith in such words. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s language 
even in matters which he did not care to conceal, either from nature or 
habit, was always hesitating and obscure, and now that he was struggling to 
hide his feelings completely, it was all the more involved in uncertainty 
and doubt. The Senators, however, whose only fear was lest they might seem 
to understand him, burst into complaints, tears, and prayers. They raised 
their hands to the gods, to the statue of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, and to the knees of 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, when he ordered a document to be produced and read. This contained 
a description of the resources of the State, of the number of citizens and 
allies under arms, of the fleets, subject kingdoms, provinces, taxes, direct 
and indirect, necessary expenses  and customary bounties. All 
these details <name type="person">Augustus</name> had written with his own hand, and had added a 
counsel, that the empire should be confined to its present limits, either 
from fear or out of jealousy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>Meantime, while the Senate stooped to the most abject supplication, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
happened to say that although he was not equal to the whole burden of the 
State, yet he would undertake the charge of whatever part of it might be 
intrusted to him. Thereupon <name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name> said, "I ask you, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, 
what part of the State you wish to have intrusted to you?" Confounded by the 
sudden inquiry he was silent for a few moments; then, recovering his 
presence of mind, he replied that it would by no means become his modesty to 
choose or to avoid in a case where he would prefer to be wholly excused. 
Then <name type="person">Gallus</name> again, who had inferred anger from his looks, said that the 
question had not been asked with the intention of dividing what could not be 
separated, but to convince him by his own admission that the body of the 
State was one, and must be directed by a single mind. He further spoke in 
praise of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, and reminded <name type="person">Tiberius</name> himself of his victories, and of 
his admirable deeds for many years as a civilian. Still, he did not thereby 
soften the emperor's resentment, for he had long been detested from an 
impression that, as he had married <name type="person">Vipsania</name>, daughter of <name type="person">Marcus Agrippa</name>, who 
had once been the wife of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, he aspired to be more than a citizen, 
and kept up the arrogant tone of his father, <name type="person">Asinius Pollio</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>Next, <name type="person">Lucius Arruntius</name>, who differed but little 
from the speech of <name type="person">Gallus</name>, gave like offence, though <name type="person">Tiberius</name> had no old 
grudge against him, but simply mistrusted him, because he was rich and 
daring, had brilliant accomplishments, and corresponding popularity. For 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, when in his last conversations he was discussing who would refuse 
the highest place, though sufficiently capable, who would aspire to it 
without being equal to it, and who would unite both the ability and 
ambition, had described <name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name> as able but contemptuously 
indifferent, <name type="person">Gallus Asiniu</name>s as ambitious and incapable, <name type="person">Lucius Arruntius</name> as 
not unworthy of it, and, should the chance be given him, sure to make the 
venture. About the two first there is a general agreement, but instead
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SERVILITY OF SENATE</note> 
of <name type="person">Arruntius</name> some have mentioned 
<name type="person">Cneius Piso</name>, and all these men, except <name type="person">Lepidus</name>, were soon afterwards 
destroyed by various charges through the contrivance of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. <name type="person">Quintus 
Haterius</name> too and <name type="person">Mamercus Scaurus</name> ruffled his suspicious temper, <name type="person">Haterius</name> by 
having said&mdash;"How long, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, will you suffer the State to be 
without a head?" <name type="person">Scaurus</name> by the remark that there was a hope that the 
Senate's prayers would not be fruitless, seeing that he had not used his 
right as Tribune to negative the motion of the Consuls. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> instantly 
broke out into invective against <name type="person">Haterius</name>; <name type="person">Scaurus</name>, with whom he was far 
more deeply displeased, he passed over in silence. Wearied at last by the 
assembly's clamorous importunity and the urgent demands of individual 
Senators, he gave way by degrees, not admitting that he undertook empire, 
but yet ceasing to refuse it and to be entreated. It is known that <name type="person">Haterius</name> 
having entered the palace to ask pardon, and thrown himself at the knees of 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> as he was walking, was almost killed by the soldiers, because 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> fell forward, accidentally or from being entangled by the 
suppliant's hands. Yet the peril of so great a man did not make him relent, 
till <name type="person">Haterius</name> went with entreaties to <name type="person">Augusta</name>, and was saved by her very 
earnest intercessions.</p></div2> <div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>Great too was 
the Senate's sycophancy to <name type="person">Augusta</name>. Some would have her styled "parent;" 
others "mother of the country," and a majority proposed that to the name of 
C&aelig;sar should be added "son of <name type="person">Julia</name>." The emperor repeatedly asserted 
that there must be a limit to the honours paid to women, and that he would 
observe similar moderation in those bestowed on himself, but annoyed at the 
invidious proposal, and indeed regarding a woman's elevation as a slight to 
himself, he would not allow so much as a lictor to be assigned her, and 
forbade the erection of an altar in memory of her adoption, and any like 
distinction. But for <name type="person">Germanicus C&aelig;sar</name> he asked pro-consular powers, 
and envoys were despatched to confer them on him, and also to express 
sympathy with his grief at the death of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. The same request was not 
made for <name type="person">Drusus</name>, because he was consul elect and present at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Twelve candidates were named for the 
pr&aelig;torship, the number which <name type="person">Augustus</name> had handed

down, and 
when the Senate urged <name type="person">Tiberius</name> to increase it, he bound himself by an oath 
not to exceed it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>It was then for the 
first time that the elections were transferred from the <rs type="placename">Campus Martius</rs> to 
the Senate. For up to that day, though the most important rested with the 
emperor's choice, some were settled by the partialities of the tribes. Nor 
did the people complain of having the right taken from them, except in mere 
idle talk, and the Senate, being now released from the necessity of bribery 
and of degrading solicitations, gladly upheld the change, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> confining 
himself to the recommendation of only four candidates who were to be 
nominated without rejection or canvass. Meanwhile the tribunes of the people 
asked leave to exhibit at their own expense games to be named after <name type="person">Augustus</name> 
and added to the Calendar as the Augustales. Money was, however, voted from 
the exchequer, and though the use of the triumphal robe in the circus was 
prescribed, it was not allowed them to ride in a chariot. Soon the annual 
celebration was transferred to the pr&aelig;tor, to whose lot fell the 
administration of justice between citizens and foreigners.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>This was the state of affairs at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> when a mutiny broke out in the legions of <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs>, which could be traced to no fresh cause except 
the change of emperors and the prospect it held out of license in tumult and 
of profit from a civil war. In the summer camp three legions were quartered, 
under the command of <name type="person">Junius Bl&aelig;sus</name>, who on hearing of the death of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> and the accession of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, had allowed his men a rest from 
military duties, either for mourning or rejoicing. This was the beginning of 
demoralization among the troops, of quarreling, of listening to the talk of 
every pestilent fellow, in short, of craving for luxury and idleness and 
loathing discipline and toil. In the camp was one <name type="person">Percennius</name>, who had once 
been a leader of one of the theatrical factions, then became a common 
soldier, had a saucy tongue, and had learnt from his applause of actors how 
to stir up a crowd. By working on ignorant minds, which doubted as to what 
would be the terms of military service after <name type="person">Augustus</name>, this man gradually 
influenced them in conversations at night or at nightfall, and when the 
better
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MUTINY IN <rs type="placename">PANNONIA</rs></note> 

men had dispersed, he gathered round him all the worst 
spirits.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>At last, when there were 
others ready to be abettors of a mutiny, he asked, in the tone of a 
demagogue, why, like slaves, they submitted to a few centurions and still 
fewer tribunes. "When," he said, "will you dare to demand relief, if you do 
not go with your prayers or arms to a new and yet tottering throne? We have 
blundered enough by our tameness for so many years, in having to endure 
thirty or forty campaigns till we grow old, most of us with bodies maimed by 
wounds. Even dismissal is not the end of our service, but, quartered under a 
legion's standard we toil through the same hardships under another title. If 
a soldier survives so many risks, he is still dragged into remote regions 
where, under the name of lands, he receives soaking swamps or mountainous 
wastes. Assuredly, military service itself is burdensome and unprofitable; 
ten ases a day is the value set on life and limb; out of this, clothing, 
arms, tents, as well as the mercy of centurions and exemptions from duty 
have to be purchased. But indeed of floggings and wounds, of hard winters, 
wearisome summers, of terrible war, or barren peace, there is no end. Our 
only relief can come from military life being entered on under fixed 
conditions, from receiving each the pay of a denarius, and from the 
sixteenth year terminating our service. We must be retained no longer under 
a standard, but in the same camp a compensation in money must be paid us. Do 
the pr&aelig;torian cohorts, which have just got their two denarii per man, 
and which after sixteen years are restored to their homes, encounter more 
perils? We do not disparage the guards of the capital; still, here amid 
barbarous tribes we have to face the enemy from our tents."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>The throng applauded from various motives, some 
pointing with indignation to the marks of the lash, others to their grey 
locks, and most of them to their threadbare garments and naked limbs. At 
last, in their fury they went so far as to propose to combine the three 
legions into one. Driven from their purpose by the jealousy with which every 
one sought the chief honour for his own legion, they turned to other 
thoughts, and set up in one spot the three eagles,

with the 
ensigns of the cohorts. At the same time they piled up turf and raised a 
mound, that they might have a more conspicuous meeting-place. Amid the 
bustle <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> came up. He upbraided them and held back man after man 
with the exclamation, "Better imbrue your hands in my blood: it will be less 
guilt to slay your commander than it is to be in revolt from the emperor. 
Either living I will uphold the loyalty of the legions, or pierced to the 
heart I will hasten on your repentance."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>None the less however was the mound piled up, and it was quite 
breast high when, at last overcome by his persistency, they gave up their 
purpose. <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>, with the consummate tact of an orator, said, "It is 
not through mutiny and tumult that the desires of the army ought to be 
communicated to <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, nor did our soldiers of old ever ask so novel a 
boon of ancient commanders, nor have you yourselves asked it of the Divine 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>. It is far from opportune that the emperor's cares, now in their 
first beginning, should be aggravated. If, however, you are bent upon 
attempting in peace what even after your victory in the civil wars you did 
not demand, why, contrary to the habit of obedience, contrary to the law of 
discipline, do you meditate violence? Decide on sending envoys, and give 
them instructions in your presence."</p>
<p>It was carried by acclamation that 
the son of <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>, one of the tribunes, should undertake the mission, 
and demand for the soldiers release from service after sixteen years. He was 
to have the rest of their message when the first part had been successful. 
After the young man's departure there was comparative quiet, but there was 
an arrogant tone among the soldiers, to whom the fact that their commander's 
son was pleading their common cause clearly showed that they had wrested by 
compulsion what they had failed to obtain by good behaviour.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>Meanwhile the companies which previous to the 
mutiny had been sent to <rs type="placename">Nauportus</rs> to make roads and bridges and for other 
purposes, when they heard of the tumult in the camp, tore up the standards, 
and having plundered the neighbouring villages and <rs type="placename">Nauportus</rs> itself, which 
was like a town, assailed the centurions who restrained them with
 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SOLDIERS FURTHER INFLAMED</note> 
jeers and insults, last of all, 
with blows. Their chief rage was against <name type="person">Aufidienus Rufus</name>, the camp-prefect, 
whom they dragged from a waggon, loaded with baggage, and drove on at the 
head of the column, asking him in ridicule whether he liked to bear such 
huge burdens and such long marches. <name type="person">Rufus</name>, who had long been a common 
soldier, then a centurion, and subsequently camp-prefect, tried to revive 
the old severe discipline, inured as he was to work and toil, and all the 
sterner because he had endured.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>On the 
arrival of these troops the mutiny broke out afresh, and straggling from the 
camp they plundered the neighbourhood. <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> ordered a few who had 
conspicuously loaded themselves with spoil to be scourged and imprisoned as 
a terror to the rest; for, ever as it then was, the commander was still 
obeyed by the centurions and by all the best men among the soldiers. As the 
men were dragged off, they struggled violently, clasped the knees of the 
bystanders, called to their comrades by name, or to the company, cohort, or 
legion to which they respectively belonged, exclaiming that all were 
threatened with the same fate. At the same time they heaped abuse on the 
commander; they appealed to heaven and to the gods, and left nothing undone 
by which they might excite resentment and pity, alarm and rage. They all 
rushed to the spot, broke open the guard-house, unbound the prisoners, and 
were in a moment fraternising with deserters and men convicted on capital 
charges.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>Thence arose a more furious 
outbreak, with more leaders of the mutiny. <name type="person">Vibulenus</name>, a common soldier, was 
hoisted in front of the general's tribunal on the shoulders of the 
bystanders and addressed the excited throng, who eagerly awaited his 
intentions. "You have indeed," he said, "restored/light and air to these 
innocent and most unhappy men, but who restores to my brother his life, or 
my brother to myself? Sent to you by the German army in our common cause, he 
was last night butchered by the gladiators whom the general keeps and arms 
for the destruction of his soldiers. Answer, <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>, where you have 
flung aside the corpse? Even an enemy grudges not burial. When, with 
embraces and tears, I have sated my grief, order me also to be slain, 
provided only that when we have been destroyed for no

crime, but 
only because we consulted the good of the legions, we may be buried by these 
men around me."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>He inflamed their 
excitement by weeping and smiting his breast and face with his hands. Then, 
hurling aside those who bore him on their shoulders, and impetuously 
flinging himself at the feet of one man after another, he roused such dismay 
and indignation that some of the soldiers put fetters on the gladiators who 
were among the number of <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>'s slaves, others did the like to the 
rest of his household, while a third party hurried out to look for the 
corpse. And had it not quickly been known that no corpse was found, that the 
slaves, when tortures were applied, denied the murder, and that the man 
never had a brother, they would have been on the point of destroying the 
general. As it was, they thrust out the tribunes and the camp-prefect; they 
plundered the baggage of the fugitives, and they killed a centurion, 
<name type="person">Lucilius</name>, to whom, with soldiers' humour, they had given the name "Bring 
another," because when he had broken one vine-stick on a man's back, he 
would call in a loud voice for another and another. The rest sheltered 
themselves in concealment, and one only was detained, <name type="person">Clemens Julius</name>, whom 
the soldiers considered a fit person to carry messages, from his ready wit. 
Two legions, the eighth and the fifteenth, were actually drawing swords 
against each other, the former demanding the death of a centurion, whom they 
nicknamed <name type="person">Sirpicus</name>, while the men of the fifteenth defended him, but the 
soldiers of the ninth interposed their entreaties, and when these were 
disregarded, their menaces.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>This 
intelligence had such an effect on <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, close as he was, and most 
careful to hush up every very serious disaster, that he despatched his son 
<name type="person">Drusus</name> with the leading men of the State and with two pr&aelig;torian 
cohorts, without any definite instructions, to take suitable measures. The 
cohorts were strengthened beyond their usual force with some picked troops. 
There was in addition a considerable part of the pr&aelig;torian cavalry, 
and the flower of the German soldiery, which was then the emperor's guard. 
With them too was the commander of the pr&aelig;torians, <name type="person">&AElig;lius 
Sejanus</name>, who had been associated with his own father, <name type="person">Strabo</name>, had great 
influence with <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and was to advise and direct
 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DRUSUS ATTEMPTS TO QUELL MUTINY</note> 
the young prince, and to hold 
out punishment or reward to the soldiers. When <name type="person">Drusus</name> approached, the 
legions, as a mark of respect, met him, not as usual, with glad looks of the 
glitter of military decorations, but in unsightly squalor, and faces which, 
though they simulated grief, rather expressed defiance.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>As soon as he entered the entrenchments, they 
secured the gates with sentries, and ordered bodies of armed men to be in 
readiness at certain points of the camp. The rest crowded round the 
general's tribunal in a dense mass. <name type="person">Drusus</name> stood there, and with a gesture 
of his hand demanded silence. As often as they turned their eyes back on the 
throng, they broke into savage exclamations, then looking up to <name type="person">Drusus</name> they 
trembled. There was a confused hum, a fierce shouting, and a sudden lull. 
Urged by conflicting emotions, they felt panic and they caused the like. At 
last, in an interval of the uproar, <name type="person">Drusus</name> read his father's letter, in 
which it was fully stated that he had a special care for the brave legions 
with which he had endured a number of campaigns; that, as soon as his mind 
had recovered from its grief, he would lay their demands before the 
Senators; that meanwhile he had sent his son to concede unhesitatingly what 
could be immediately granted, and that the rest must be reserved for the 
Senate, which ought to have a voice in showing either favour or 
severity.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>The crowd replied that they 
had delivered their instructions to <name type="person">Clemens</name>, one of the centurions, which he 
was to convey to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. He began to speak of the 
soldiers' discharge after sixteen years, of the rewards of completed 
service, of the daily pay being a denarius, and of the veterans not being 
detained under a standard. When <name type="person">Drusus</name> pleaded in answer reference to the 
Senate and to his father, he was interrupted by a tumultuous shout. "Why had 
he come, neither to increase the soldiers' pay, nor to alleviate their 
hardships, in a word, with no power to better their lot? Yet heaven knew 
that all were allowed to scourge and to execute. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> used formerly in 
the name of <name type="person">Augustus</name> to frustrate the wishes of the legions, and the same 
tricks were now revived by <name type="person">Drusus</name>. Was it only sons who were to visit them? 
Certainly, it was a new thing for the emperor to refer to

the 
Senate merely what concerned the soldier's interests. Was then the same 
Senate to be consulted whenever notice was given of an execution or of a 
battle? Were their rewards to be at the discretion of absolute rulers, their 
punishments to be without appeal?"</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>At 
last they deserted the general's tribunal, and to any pr&aelig;torian 
soldier or friend of <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s who met them they used those threatening 
gestures which are the cause of strife and the beginning of a conflict, with 
special rage against <name type="person">Cneius Lentulus</name>, because they thought that he above all 
others, by his age and warlike renown, encouraged <name type="person">Drusus</name>, and was the first 
to scorn such blots on military discipline. Soon after, as he was leaving 
with <name type="person">Drusus</name> to betake himself in foresight of his danger to the winter camp, 
they surrounded him, and asked him again and again whither he was going; was 
it to the emperor or to the Senate, there also to oppose the interests of 
the legions. At the same moment they menaced him savagely and flung stones. 
And now, bleeding from a blow, and feeling destruction certain, he was 
rescued by the hurried arrival of the throng which had accompanied 
<name type="person">Drusus</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>That terrible night which 
threatened an explosion of crime was tranquillised by a mere accident. 
Suddenly in a clear sky the moon's radiance seemed to die away. This the 
soldiers in their ignorance of the cause regarded as an omen of their 
condition, comparing the failure of her light to their own efforts, and 
imagining that their attempts would end prosperously should her brightness 
and splendour be restored to the goddess. And so they raised a din with 
brazen instruments and the combined notes of trumpets and horns, with joy or 
sorrow, as she brightened or grew dark. When clouds arose and obstructed 
their sight, and it was thought she was buried in the gloom, with that 
proneness to superstition which steals over minds once thoroughly cowed, 
they lamented that this was a portent of neverending hardship, and that 
heaven frowned on their deeds.</p>
<p><name type="person">Drusus</name>, thinking that he ought to avail 
himself of this change in their temper and turn what chance had offered to a 
wise account, ordered the tents to be visited. <name type="person">Clemens</name>, the centurion was 
summoned with all others who for their
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SOLDIERS COWED BY 
LUNAR ECLIPSE</note> 
good qualities were liked by the common soldiers. 
These men made their way among the patrols, sentries and guards of the 
camp-gates, suggesting hope or holding out threats. "How long will you 
besiege the emperor's son? What is to be the end of our strifes? Will 
<name type="person">Percennius</name> and <name type="person">Vibulenus</name> give pay to the soldiers and land to those who have 
earned their discharge? In a word, are they, instead of the Neros and the 
Drusi, to control the empire of the Roman people? Why are we not rather 
first in our repentance as we were last in the offence? Demands made in 
common are granted slowly; a separate favour you may deserve and receive at 
the same moment."</p>
<p>With minds affected by these words and growing mutually 
suspicious, they divided off the new troops from the old, and one legion 
from another. Then by degrees the instinct of obedience returned. They 
quitted the gates and restored to their places the standards which at the 
beginning of the mutiny they had grouped into one spot.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>At daybreak <name type="person">Drusus</name> called them to an assembly, and, 
though not a practised speaker, yet with natural dignity upbraided them for 
their past and commended their present behaviour. He was not, he said, to be 
conquered by terror or by threats. Were he to see them inclining to 
submission and hear the language of entreaty, he would write to his father, 
that he might be merciful and receive the legions' petition. At their 
prayer, <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>, a Roman knight on <name type="person">Drusus</name>'s staff, 
with <name type="person">Justus Catonius</name>, a first-rank centurion, were again sent to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. 
Then ensued a conflict of opinion among them, some maintaining that it was 
best to wait the envoys' return and meanwhile humour the soldiers, others, 
that stronger measures ought to be used, inasmuch as the rabble knows no 
mean, and inspires fear, unless they are afraid, though when they have once 
been overawed, they can be safely despised. "While superstition still swayed 
them, the general should apply terror by removing the leaders of the 
mutiny." </p><p><name type="person">Drusus</name>'s temper was inclined to harsh measures. He summoned 
<name type="person">Vibulenus</name> and <name type="person">Percennius</name> and ordered them to be put to death. The common 
account is that they were buried

in the general's tent, though 
according to some their bodies were flung outside the entrenchments for all 
to see.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>Search was then made for all 
the chief mutineers. Some as they roamed outside the camp were cut down by 
the centurions or by soldiers of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts. Some even the 
companies gave up in proof of their loyalty. The men's troubles were 
increased by an early winter with continuous storms so violent that they 
could not go beyond their tents or meet together or keep the standards in 
their places, from which they were perpetually torn by hurricane and rain. 
And there still lingered the dread of the divine wrath; nor was it without 
meaning, they thought, that, hostile to an impious host, the stars grew dim 
and storms burst over them. Their only relief from misery was to quit an 
ill-omened and polluted camp, and, having purged themselves of their guilt, 
to betake themselves again every one to his winter-quarters. First the 
eighth, then the fifteenth legion returned; the ninth cried again and again 
that they ought to wait for the letter from <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, but soon finding 
themselves isolated by the departure of the rest, they voluntarily 
forestalled their inevitable fate. <name type="person">Drusus</name>, without awaiting the envoys' 
return, as for the present all was quiet, went back to 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>About the 
same time, from the same causes, the legions of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> rose in mutiny, with a fury proportioned to 
their greater numbers, in the confident hope that <name type="person">Germanicus C&aelig;sar</name> 
would not be able to endure another's supremacy and would offer himself to 
the legions, whose strength would carry everything before it. There were two 
armies on the bank of the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>; that named the 
upper army had <name type="person">Caius Silius</name> for general; the lower was under the charge of 
<name type="person">Aulus C&aelig;cina</name>. The supreme direction rested with <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, then 
busily employed in conducting the assessment of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>. The troops under the control of <name type="person">Silius</name>, with minds 
yet in suspense, watched the issue of mutiny elsewhere; but the soldiers of 
the lower army fell into a frenzy, which had its beginning in the men of the 
twenty first and fifth legions, and into which the first and twentieth were 
also drawn. For they were all quartered in the same summer-camp, in the 
territory of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name>, enjoying ease or having 
 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SIMULTANEOUS MUTINY IN <rs type="placename">GERMANY</rs></note> 
only 
light duties. Accordingly on hearing of the death of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, a rabble of 
city slaves, who had been enlisted under a recent levy at 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, habituated to laxity and impatient of hardship, 
filled the ignorant minds of the other soldiers with notions that the time 
had come when the veteran might demand a timely discharge, the young, more 
liberal pay, all, an end of their miseries, and vengeance on the cruelty of 
centurions.</p>
<p>It was not one alone who spoke thus, as did <name type="person">Percennius</name> among 
the legions of <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs>, nor was it in the ears of 
trembling soldiers, who looked with apprehension to other and mightier 
armies, but there was sedition in many a face and voice. "The Roman world," 
they said, "was in their hand; their victories aggrandised the State; it was 
from them that emperors received their titles."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>Nor did their commander check them. Indeed, the blind rage of so 
many had robbed him of his resolution. In a sudden frenzy they rushed with 
drawn swords on the centurions, the immemorial object of the soldiers' 
resentment and the first cause of savage fury. They threw them to the earth 
and beat them sorely, sixty to one, so as to correspond with the number of 
centurions. Then tearing them from the ground, mangled, and some lifeless, 
they flung them outside the entrenchments or into the river <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>. One <name type="person">Septimius</name>, who fled to the tribunal and was 
grovelling at <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name>'s feet, was persistently demanded till he was 
given up to destruction. <name type="person">Cassius Ch&aelig;rea</name>, who won for himself a memory 
with posterity by the murder of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, being then a youth of 
high spirit, cleared a passage with his sword through the armed and opposing 
throng. Neither tribune nor camp-prefect maintained authority any longer. 
Patrols, sentries, and whatever else the needs of the time required, were 
distributed by the men themselves. To those who could guess the temper of 
soldiers with some penetration, the strongest symptom of a wide-spread and 
intractable commotion, was the fact that, instead of being divided or 
instigated by a few persons, they were unanimous in their fury and equally 
unanimous in their composure, with so uniform a consistency that one would 
have thought them to be under command.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>Meantime <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, while, as I have related, he was collecting 
the taxes of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, received news of the death of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>. He was married to the granddaughter of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, by 
whom he had several children, and though he was himself the son of <name type="person">Drusus</name>, 
brother of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and grandson of <name type="person">Augusta</name>, he was troubled by the secret 
hatred of his uncle and grandmother, the motives for which were the more 
venomous because unjust. For the memory of <name type="person">Drusus</name> was held in honour by the 
Roman people, and they believed that had he obtained empire, he would have 
restored freedom. Hence they regarded <name type="person">Germanicus</name> with favour and with the 
same hope. He was indeed a young man of unaspiring temper, and of wonderful 
kindliness, contrasting strongly with the proud and mysterious reserve that 
marked the conversation and the features of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. Then, there were 
feminine jealousies, <name type="person">Livia</name> feeling a stepmother's bitterness towards 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and <name type="person">Agrippina</name> herself too being rather excitable, only her purity 
and love of her husband gave a right direction to her otherwise imperious 
disposition.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>But the nearer <name type="person">Germanicus</name> 
was to the highest hope, the more laboriously did he exert himself for 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and he made the neighbouring <name type="ethnic">Sequani</name> and all the Belgic states 
swear obedience to him. On hearing of the mutiny in the legions, he 
instantly went to the spot, and met them outside the camp, eyes fixed on the 
ground, and seemingly repentant. As soon as he entered the entrenchments, 
confused murmurs became audible. Some men, seizing his hand under pretence 
of kissing it, thrust his fingers into their mouths, that he might touch 
their toothless gums; others showed him their limbs bowed with age. He 
ordered the throng which stood near him, as it seemed a promiscuous 
gathering, to separate itself into its military companies. They replied that 
they would hear better as they were. The standards were then to be advanced, 
so that thus at least the cohorts might be distinguished. The soldiers 
obeyed reluctantly. Then beginning with a reverent mention of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, he 
passed on to the victories and triumphs of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, dwelling with especial 
praise on his glorious achievements with those legions in <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>. Next, he extolled the
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">LOYALTY 
OF GERMANICUS</note> 
unity of <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, the loyalty of 
<rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, the entire absence of turbulence or strife. He 
was heard in silence or with but a slight murmur.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>As soon as he touched on the mutiny and asked what had become of 
soldierly obedience, of the glory of ancient discipline, whither they had 
driven their tribunes and centurions, they all bared their bodies and 
taunted him with the scars of their wounds and the marks of the lash. And 
then with confused exclamations they spoke bitterly of the prices of 
exemptions, of their scanty pay, of the severity of their tasks, with 
special mention of the entrenchment, the fosse, the conveyance of fodder, 
building-timber, fire-wood, and whatever else had to be procured from 
necessity, or as a check on idleness in the camp. The fiercest clamour arose 
from the veteran soldiers, who, as they counted their thirty campaigns or 
more, implored him to relieve worn-out men, and not let them die under the 
same hardships, but have an end of such harassing service, and repose 
without beggary. Some even claimed the legacy of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, with 
words of good omen for <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, and, should he wish for empire, they 
showed themselves abundantly willing. Thereupon, as though he were 
contracting the pollution of guilt, he leapt impetuously from the tribunal. 
The men opposed his departure with their weapons, threatening him repeatedly 
if he would not go back. But <name type="person">Germanicus</name> protesting that he would die rather 
than cast off his loyalty, plucked his sword from his side, raised it aloft 
and was plunging it into his breast, when those nearest him seized his hand 
and held it by force. The remotest and most densely crowded part of the 
throng, and, what almost passes belief, some, who came close up to him, 
urged him to strike the blow, and a soldier, by name <name type="person">Calusidius</name>, offered him 
a drawn sword, saying that it was sharper than his own. Even in their fury, 
this seemed to them a savage act and one of evil precedent, and there was a 
pause during which <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s friends hurried him into his 
tent.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>There they took counsel how to 
heal matters. For news was also brought that the soldiers were preparing the 
despatch of envoys who were to draw the upper army into their cause; that 
the capital of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name> was marked out

for destruction, and that 
hands with the stain of plunder on them would soon be daring enough for the 
pillage of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>. The alarm was heightened by the 
knowledge that the enemy was aware of the Roman mutiny, and would certainly 
attack if the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> bank were undefended. Yet if the 
auxiliary troops and allies were to be armed against the retiring legions, 
civil war was in fact begun. Severity would be dangerous; profuse liberality 
would be scandalous. Whether all or nothing were conceded to the soldiery, 
the State was equally in jeopardy. </p>
<p>Accordingly, having weighed their 
plans one against each other, they decided that a letter should be written 
in the prince's name, to the effect that full discharge was granted to those 
who had served in twenty campaigns; that there was a conditional release for 
those who had served sixteen, and that they were to be retained under a 
standard with immunity from everything except actually keeping off the 
enemy; that the legacies which they had asked, were to be paid and 
doubled.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>The soldiers perceived that 
all this was invented for the occasion, and instantly pressed their demands. 
The discharge from service was quickly arranged by the tribunes. Payment was 
put off till they reached their respective winter-quarters. The men of the 
fifth and twenty-first legions refused to go till in the summer-camp where 
they stood the money was made up out of the purses of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> himself and 
his friends, and paid in full. The first and twentieth legions were led back 
by their officer <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> to the canton of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name>, marching in 
disgrace, since sums of money which had been extorted from the general were 
carried among the eagles and standards. <name type="person">Germanicus</name> went to the Upper Army, 
and the second, thirteenth, and sixteenth legions, without any delay, 
accepted from him the oath of allegiance. The fourteenth hesitated a little, 
but their money and the discharge were offered even without their demanding 
it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>Meanwhile there was an outbreak 
among the <name type="ethnic">Chauci</name>, begun by some veterans of the mutinous legions on garrison 
duty. They were quelled for a time by the instant execution of two soldiers. 
Such was the order of <name type="person">Mennius</name>,
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CONCESSIONS TO 
MUTINEERS</note> 
the camp-prefect, more as a salutary warning than as a 
legal act. Then, when the commotion increased, he fled and having been 
discovered, as his hiding place was now unsafe, he borrowed a resource from 
audacity. "It was not," he told them, "the camp-prefect, it was <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, 
their general, it was <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, their emperor, whom they were insulting." At 
the same moment, overawing all resistance, he seized the standard, faced 
round towards the river-bank, and exclaiming that whoever left the ranks, he 
would hold as a deserter, he led them back into their winter-quarters, 
disaffected indeed, but cowed.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>Meanwhile envoys from the Senate had an interview with <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, who had 
now returned, at the Altar of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name>. Two legions, the first and 
twentieth, with veterans discharged and serving under a standard, were there 
in winter-quarters. In the bewilderment of terror and conscious guilt they 
were penetrated by an apprehension that persons had come at the Senate's 
orders to cancel the concessions they had extorted by mutiny. And as it is 
the way with a mob to fix any charge, however groundless, on some particular 
person, they reproached <name type="person">Munatius Plancus</name>, an ex-consul and the chief envoy, 
with being the author of the Senate's decree. At midnight they began to 
demand the imperial standard kept in <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s quarters, and having 
rushed together to the entrance, burst the door, dragged <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> from 
his bed, and forced him by menaces of death to give up the standard. Then 
roaming through the camp-streets, they met the envoys, who on hearing of the 
tumult were hastening to <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. They loaded them with insults, and were 
on the point of murdering them, <name type="person">Plancus</name> especially, whose high rank had 
deterred him from flight. In his peril he found safety only in the camp of 
the first legion. There clasping the standards and the eagle, he sought to 
protect himself under their sanctity. And had not the eagle-bearer, 
<name type="person">Calpurnius</name>, saved him from the worst violence, the blood of an envoy of the 
Roman people, an occurrence rare even among our foes, would in a Roman camp 
have stained the altars of the gods. </p>
<p>At last, with the light of day, 
when the general and the soldiers and the whole affair were clearly 
recognised. <name type="person">Germanicus</name>

entered the camp, ordered <name type="person">Plancus</name> to be 
conducted to him, and received him on the tribunal. He then upbraided them 
with their fatal infatuation, revived not so much by the anger of the 
soldiers as by that of heaven, and explained the reasons of the envoys' 
arrival. On the rights of ambassadors, on the dreadful and undeserved peril 
of <name type="person">Plancus</name>, and also on the disgrace into which the legion had brought 
itself, he dwelt with the eloquence of pity, and while the throng was 
confounded rather than appeased, he dismissed the envoys with an escort of 
auxiliary cavalry.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>Amid the alarm all 
condemned <name type="person">Germanicus</name> for not going to the Upper Army, where he might find 
obedience and help against the rebels. "Enough and more than enough 
blunders," they said, "had been made by granting discharges and money, 
indeed, by conciliatory measures. Even if <name type="person">Germanicus</name> held his own life 
cheap, why should he keep a little son and a pregnant wife among madmen who 
outraged every human right? Let these, at least, be restored safely to their 
grandsire and to the State."</p>
<p>When his wife spurned the notion, protesting 
that she was a descendant of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> and could face peril with 
no degenerate spirit, he at last embraced her and the son of their love with 
many tears, and after long delay compelled her to depart. Slowly moved along 
a pitiable procession of women, a general's fugitive wife with a little son 
in her bosom, her friends' wives weeping round her, as with her they were 
dragging themselves from the camp. Not less sorrowful were those who 
remained.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>There was no appearance of 
the triumphant general about <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, and he seemed to be in a conquered 
city rather than in his own camp, while groans and wailings attracted the 
ears and looks even of the soldiers. They came out of their tents, asking 
"what was that mournful sound? What meant the sad sight? Here were ladies of 
rank, not a centurion to escort them, not a soldier, no sign of a prince's 
wife, none of the usual retinue. Could they be going to the <name type="ethnic">Treveri</name>, to be 
subjects of the foreigner?" Then they felt shame and pity, and remembered 
his father <name type="person">Agrippa</name>, her grandfather <name type="person">Augustus</name>, her father-in-law <name type="person">Drusus</name>, her 
own glory as a mother of children, her noble purity. And there

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GERMANICUS ENDANGERED; HIS SPEECH</note>
was her little child 
too, born in the camp, brought up amid the tents of the legions, whom they 
used to call in soldiers' fashion, <name type="person">Caligula</name>, because he often wore the shoe 
so called, to win the men's goodwill. But nothing moved them so much as 
jealousy towards the <name type="ethnic">Treveri</name>. They entreated, stopped the way, that 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name> might return and remain, some running to meet her, while most of 
them went back to <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. He, with a grief and anger that were yet 
fresh, thus began to address the throng around him&mdash;</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>"Neither wife nor son are dearer to me than my 
father and the State. But he will surely have the protection of his own 
majesty, the empire of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> that of our other 
armies. My wife and children whom, were it a question of your glory, I would 
willingly expose to destruction, I now remove to a distance from your fury, 
so that whatever wickedness is thereby threatened, may be expiated by my 
blood only, and that you may not be made more guilty by the slaughter of a 
great-grandson of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, and the murder of a daughter-in-law of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. 
For what have you not dared, what have you not profaned during these days? 
What name shall I give to this gathering? Am I to call you soldiers, you who 
have beset with entrenchments and arms your general's son, or citizens, when 
you have trampled under foot the authority of the Senate? Even the rights of 
public enemies, the sacred character of the ambassador, and the law of 
nations have been violated by you. The Divine <name type="person">Julius</name> once quelled an army's 
mutiny with a single word by calling those who were renouncing their 
military obedience 'citizens.' The Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> cowed the legions who had 
fought at <rs type="placename">Actium</rs> with one look of his face. Though I am not yet what they 
were, still, descended as I am from them, it would be a strange and unworthy 
thing should I be spurned by the soldiery of <rs type="placename">Spain</rs> 
or <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. First and twentieth legions, you who 
received your standards from <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, you, men of the twentieth who have 
shared with me so many battles and have been enriched with so many rewards, 
is not this a fine gratitude with which you are repaying your general? Are 
these the tidings which I shall have to carry to my father when he hears 
only joyful intelligence from our other provinces, that his own recruits, 
his own veterans are not satis-

fied with discharge or pay; that 
here only centurions are murdered, tribunes driven away, envoys imprisoned, 
camps and rivers stained with blood, while I am myself dragging on a 
precarious existence amid those who hate me?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>"Why, on the first day of our meeting, why did you, my friends, 
wrest from me, in your blindness, the steel which I was preparing to plunge 
into my breast? Better and more loving was the act of the man who offered me 
the sword. At any rate I should have perished before I was as yet conscious 
of all the disgraces of my army, while you would have chosen a general who 
though he might allow my death to pass unpunished would avenge the death of 
<name type="person">Varus</name> and his three legions. Never indeed may heaven suffer the <name type="ethnic">Belgae</name>, 
though they proffer their aid, to have the glory and honour of having 
rescued the name of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and quelled the tribes of 
<rs type="placename">Germany</rs>. It is thy spirit, Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, now 
received into heaven, thine image, father <name type="person">Drusus</name>, and the remembrance of 
thee, which, with these same soldiers who are now stimulated by shame and 
ambition, should wipe out this blot and turn the wrath of civil strife to 
the destruction of the foe. You too, in whose faces and in whose hearts I 
perceive a change, if only you restore to the Senate their envoys, to the 
emperor his due allegiance, to myself my wife and son, do you stand aloof 
from pollution and separate the mutinous from among you. This will be a 
pledge of your repentance, a guarantee of your loyalty."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>Thereupon, as suppliants confessing that his 
reproaches were true, they implored him to punish the guilty, pardon those 
who had erred, and lead them against the enemy. And he was to recall his 
wife, to let the nursling of the legions return and not be handed over as a 
hostage to the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>. As to <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s return, he made the excuse of her 
approaching confinement and of winter. His son, he said, would come, and the 
rest they might settle themselves. Away they hurried hither and thither, 
altered men, and dragged the chief mutineers in chains to <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;tronius</name>, commander of the first legion, who tried and punished them 
one by one in the following fashion. In front of the throng stood the 
legions with drawn swords. Each accused man was on a raised platform and was 
pointed out by a tribune.

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MUTINY QUELLED; ALARM AT <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note>
If they shouted out that he was guilty, he 
was thrown head-long and cut to pieces. The soldiers gloated over the 
blood-shed as though it gave them absolution. Nor did <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> check 
them, seeing that without any order from himself the same men were 
responsible for all the cruelty and all the odium of the deed.</p>
<p>The 
example was followed by the veterans, who were soon afterwards sent into <rs type="placename">R&aelig;tia</rs>, nominally to defend the province against a 
threatened invasion of the <name type="ethnic">Suevi</name>, but really that they might tear themselves 
from a camp stamped with the horror of a dreadful remedy no less than with 
the memory of guilt. Then the general revised the list of centurions. Each, 
at his summons, stated his name, his rank, his birthplace, the number of his 
campaigns, what brave deeds he had done in battle, his military rewards, if 
any. If the tribunes and the legion commended his energy and good behaviour, 
he retained his rank; where they unanimously charged him with rapacity or 
cruelty, he was dismissed the service.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>Quiet being thus restored for the present, a no less formidable difficulty 
remained through the turbulence of the fifth and twenty-first legions, who 
were in winter quarters sixty miles away at <placeName key="tgn,2556628">Old Camp</placeName>, as the place was 
called. These, in fact, had been the first to begin the mutiny, and the most 
atrocious deeds had been committed by their hands. Unawed by the punishment 
of their comrades, and unmoved by their contrition, they still retained 
their resentment. <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> accordingly proposed to send an armed fleet 
with some of our allies down the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, resolved to 
make war on them should they reject his authority.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, meanwhile, when the result of 
affairs in <rs type="placename">Illyrium</rs> was not yet known, and men had 
heard of the commotion among the German legions, the citizens in alarm 
reproached <name type="person">Tiberius</name> for the hypocritical irresolution with which he was 
befooling the senate and the people, feeble and disarmed as they were, while 
the soldiery were all the time in revolt, and could not be quelled by the 
yet imperfectly-matured authority of two striplings. "He ought to have gone 
himself and confronted with his imperial majesty those who would have soon 
yielded, when they once saw a

sovereign of long experience, who 
was the supreme dispenser of rigour or of bounty. Could <name type="person">Augustus</name>, with the 
feebleness of age on him, so often visit <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, 
and is <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, in the vigour of life, to sit in the Senate and criticise 
its members' words? He had taken good care that there should be slavery at 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>; he should now apply some soothing medicine to 
the spirit of soldiers, that they might be willing to endure 
peace."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>Notwithstanding these 
remonstrances, it was the inflexible purpose of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> not to quit the 
head-quarters of empire or to imperil himself and the State. Indeed, many 
conflicting thoughts troubled him. The army in <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> was the stronger; that in <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs> the nearer; the first was supported by all the 
strength of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>; the latter menaced <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. Which was he to prefer, without the fear that 
those whom he slighted would be infuriated by the affront? But his sons 
might alike visit both, and not compromise the imperial dignity, which 
inspired the greatest awe at a distance. There was also an excuse for mere 
youths referring some matters to their father, with the possibility that he 
could conciliate or crush those who resisted <name type="person">Germanicus</name> or <name type="person">Drusus</name>. What 
resource remained, if they despised the emperor? However, as if on the eve 
of departure, he selected his attendants, provided his camp-equipage, and 
prepared a fleet; then winter and matters of business were the various 
pretexts with which he amused, first, sensible men, then the populace, last, 
and longest of all, the provinces.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p><name type="person">Germanicus</name> meantime, though he had concentrated his army and prepared 
vengeance against the mutineers, thought that he ought still to allow them 
an interval, in case they might, with the late warning before them, regard 
their safety. He sent a despatch to <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name>, which said that he was on 
the way with a strong force, and that, unless they forestalled his arrival 
by the execution of the guilty, he would resort to an indiscriminate 
massacre. <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> read the letter confidentially to the eagle and 
standard-bearers, and to all in the camp who were least tainted by 
disloyalty, and urged them to save the whole army from disgrace, and 
themselves from destruction. "In peace," he said, "the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MASSACRE OF AGITATORS</note> 
merits of a man's case are 
carefully weighed when war bursts on us, innocent and guilty alike 
perish."</p>
<p>Upon this, they sounded those whom they thought best for their 
purpose, and when they saw that a majority of their legions remained loyal, 
at the commander's suggestion they fixed a time for falling with the sword 
on all the vilest and foremost of the mutineers. Then, at a mutually given 
signal, they rushed into the tents, and butchered the unsuspecting men, none 
but those in the secret knowing what was the beginning or what was to be the 
end of the slaughter.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>The scene was a 
contrast to all civil wars which have ever occurred. It was not in battle, 
it was not from opposing camps, it was from those same dwellings where day 
saw them at their common meals, night resting from labour, that they divided 
themselves into two factions, and showered on each other their missiles. 
Uproar, wounds, bloodshed, were everywhere visible; the cause was a mystery. 
All else was at the disposal of chance. Even some loyal men were slain, for, 
on its being once understood who were the objects of fury, some of the worst 
mutineers too had seized on weapons. Neither commander nor tribune was 
present to control them; the men were allowed license and vengeance to their 
heart's content. Soon afterwards <name type="person">Germanicus</name> entered the camp, and exclaiming 
with a flood of tears, that this was destruction rather than remedy, ordered 
the bodies to be burnt.</p>
<p>Even then their savage spirit was seized with a 
desire to march against the enemy, as an atonement for their frenzy, and it 
was felt that the shades of their fellow-soldiers could be appeased only by 
exposing such impious breasts to honourable scars. <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> followed up 
the enthusiasm of the men, and having bridged over the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, he sent across it 12,000 from the legions, with 
six-and-twenty allied cohorts, and eight squadrons of cavalry, whose 
discipline had been without a stain during the mutiny.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>There was exultation among the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, not far 
off, as long as we were detained by the public mourning for the loss of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, and then by our dissensions. But the Roman general in a forced 
march, cut through the <rs type="placename">C&aelig;sian</rs> forest and the barrier which had been 
begun by <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and pitched his camp on this barrier, his front and 
rear

being defended by intrenchments, his flanks by timber 
barricades. He then penetrated some forest passes but little known, and, as 
there were two routes, he deliberated whether he should pursue the short and 
ordinary route, or that which was more difficult and unexplored, and 
consequently unguarded by the enemy. He chose the longer way, and hurried on 
every remaining preparation, for his scouts had brought word that among the 
<name type="ethnic">Germans</name> it was a night of festivity, with games, and one of their grand 
banquets. <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> had orders to advance with some light cohorts, and to 
clear away any obstructions from the woods. The legions followed at a 
moderate interval. They were helped by a night of bright starlight, reached 
the villages of the <name type="ethnic">Marsi</name>, and threw their pickets round the enemy, who even 
then were stretched on beds or at their tables, without the least fear, or 
any sentries before their camp, so complete was their carelessness and 
disorder; and of war indeed there was no apprehension. Peace it certainly 
was not&mdash;merely the languid and heedless ease of half-intoxicated 
people.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p><name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, to spread 
devastation more widely, divided his eager legions into four columns, and 
ravaged a space of fifty miles with fire and sword. Neither sex nor age 
moved his compassion. Everything, sacred or profane, the temple too of 
<name type="person">Tamfana</name>, as they called it, the special resort of all those tribes, was 
levelled to the ground. There was not a wound among our soldiers, who cut 
down a half-asleep, an unarmed, or a straggling foe. The <name type="ethnic">Bructeri</name>, <name type="ethnic">Tubantes</name>, 
and <name type="ethnic">Usipetes</name>, were roused by this slaughter, and they beset the forest 
passes through which the army had to return. The general knew this, and he 
marched, prepared both to advance and to fight. Part of the cavalry, and 
some of the auxiliary cohorts led the van; then came the first legion, and, 
with the baggage in the centre, the men of the twenty-first closed up the 
left, those of the fifth, the right flank. The twentieth legion secured the 
rear, and, next, were the rest of the allies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the enemy moved 
not till the army began to defile in column through the woods, then made 
slight skirmishing attacks on its flanks and van, and with his whole force 
charged the rear. The light cohorts were thrown into confusion by the dense 
masses of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, when <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GERMANICUS' SUCCESS

rode up to the men of the twentieth legion, and in 
a loud voice exclaimed that this was the time for wiping out the mutiny. 
"Advance," he said, "and hasten to turn your guilt into glory." This fired 
their courage, and at a single dash they broke through the enemy, and drove 
him back with great slaughter into the open country. At the same moment the 
troops of the van emerged from the woods and intrenched a camp. After this 
their march was uninterrupted, and the soldiery, with the confidence of 
recent success, and forgetful of the past, were placed in 
winter-quarters.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>The news was a source 
of joy and also of anxiety to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. He rejoiced that the mutiny was 
crushed, but the fact that <name type="person">Germanicus</name> had won the soldiers' favour by 
lavishing money, and promptly granting the discharge, as well as his fame as 
a soldier, annoyed him. Still, he brought his achievements under the notice 
of the Senate, and spoke much of his greatness in language elaborated for 
effect, more so than could be believed to come from his inmost heart. He 
bestowed a briefer praise on <name type="person">Drusus</name>, and on the termination of the 
disturbance in <rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs>, but he was more earnest, 
and his speech more hearty. And he confirmed, too, in the armies of <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs> all the concessions of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>That same year <placeName key="tgn,2118772">Julia</placeName> ended her days. For her 
profligacy she had formerly been confined by her father <name type="person">Augustus</name> in the 
island of <rs type="placename">Pandateria</rs>, and then in the town of the 
<rs type="placename">Regini</rs> on the shores of the straits of <rs type="placename">Sicily</rs>. She had been the wife of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> while <name type="person">Caius </name>
and <name type="person">Lucius C&aelig;sar</name> were in their glory, and had disdained him as an 
unequal match. This was <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s special reason for retiring to <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs>. When he obtained the empire, he left her in 
banishment and disgrace, deprived of all hope after the murder of <name type="person">Postumus 
Agrippa</name>, and let her perish by a lingering death of destitution, with the 
idea that an obscurity would hang over her end from the length of her exile. 
He had a like motive for cruel vengeance on <name type="person">Sempronius Gracchus</name>, a man of 
noble family, of shrewd understanding, and a perverse eloquence, who had 
seduced this same <name type="person">Julia</name> when she was the wife of <name type="person">Marcus Agrippa</name>. And this 
was not the end of the intrigue. When she had been handed over to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
her persistent paramour inflamed her with disobedience and hatred 
towards

her husband; and a letter which <name type="person">Julia</name> wrote to her father 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, inveighing against <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, was supposed to be the composition of 
<name type="person">Gracchus</name>. He was accordingly banished to <rs type="placename">Cercina</rs>, 
where he endured an exile of fourteen years. Then the soldiers who were sent 
to slay him, found him on a promontory, expecting no good. On their arrival, 
he begged a brief interval in which to give by letter his last instructions 
to his wife <name type="person">Alliaria</name>, and then offered his neck to the executioners, dying 
with a courage not unworthy of the Sempronian name, which his degenerate 
life had dishonoured. Some have related that these soldiers were not sent 
from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, but by <name type="person">Lucius Asprenas</name>, proconsul of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, on the authority of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, who had vainly 
hoped that the infamy of the murder might be shifted on 
<name type="person">Asprenas</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>The same year witnessed the 
establishment of religious ceremonies in a new priesthood of the brotherhood 
of the Augustales, just as in former days <name type="person">Titus Tatius</name>, to retain the rites 
of the <name type="ethnic">Sabines</name>, had instituted the Titian brotherhood. Twenty-one were 
chosen by lot from the chief men of the State; <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, <name type="person">Drusus</name>, <name type="person">Claudius</name>, 
and <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, were added to the number. The Augustal games which were then 
inaugurated, were disturbed by quarrels arising out of rivalry between the 
actors. <name type="person">Augustus</name> had shown indulgence to the entertainment by way of 
humouring <name type="person">M&aelig;cenas</name>'s extravagant passion for <name type="person">Bathyllus</name>, nor did he 
himself dislike such amusements, and he thought it citizenlike to mingle in 
the pleasures of the populace. Very different was the tendency of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s 
character. But a people so many years indulgently treated, he did not yet 
venture to put under harsher control.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>In the consulship of <name type="person">Drusus C&aelig;sar</name> and <name type="person">Caius Norbanus</name>, <name type="person">Germanicus</name> had a 
triumph decreed him, though war still lasted. And though it was for the 
summer campaign that he was most vigorously preparing, he anticipated it by 
a sudden inroad on the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name> in the beginning of spring. There had, in 
fact, sprung up a hope of the enemy being divided between <name type="person">Arminius</name> and 
<name type="person">Segestes</name>, famous, respectively, for treachery and loyalty towards us. 
<name type="person">Arminius</name> was the disturber of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>. <name type="person">Segestes</name> 
often revealed the fact that a rebellion was being organized, more 
especially at that

last banquet after which they rushed to arms, and he urged <name type="person">Varus</name> to arrest 
himself and <name type="person">Arminius</name> and all the other chiefs, assuring him that the people 
would attempt nothing if the leading men were removed, and that he would 
then have an opportunity of sifting accusations and distinguishing the 
innocent. But <name type="person">Varus</name> fell by fate and by the sword of <name type="person">Arminius</name>, with whom 
<name type="person">Segestes</name>, though dragged into war by the unanimous voice of the nation, 
continued to be at feud, his resentment being heightened by personal 
motives, as <name type="person">Arminius</name> had carried off his daughter who was betrothed to 
another. With a son-in-law detested, and fathers-in-law also at enmity, what 
are bonds of love between united hearts became with bitter foes incentives 
to fury.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p><name type="person">Germanicus</name> accordingly gave 
<name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> four legions, five thousand auxiliaries, with some hastily 
raised levies from the <name type="ethnic"><placeName key="tgn,2088713">Germans</placeName></name> dwelling on the left bank of the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>. He was himself at the head of an equal number of 
legions and twice as many allies. Having established a fort on the site of 
his father's entrenchments on <rs type="placename">Mount Taunus</rs> he 
hurried his troops in quick marching order against the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>, leaving 
<name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name> to direct works connected with roads and bridges. With a dry 
season and comparatively shallow streams, a rare circumstance in that 
climate, he had accomplished, without obstruction, a rapid march, and he 
feared for his return heavy rains and swollen rivers. But so suddenly did he 
come on the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name> that all the helpless from age or sex were at once 
captured or slaughtered. Their able-bodied men had swum across the river <rs type="placename">Adrana</rs>, and were trying to keep back the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> as they 
were commencing a bridge. Subsequently they were driven back by missiles and 
arrows, and having in vain attempted negotiations for peace, some took 
refuge with <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, while the rest, leaving their cantons and villages 
dispersed themselves in their forests.</p>
<p>After burning <rs type="placename">Mattium</rs>, the capital of the tribe, and ravaging the open 
country, <name type="person">Germanicus</name> marched back towards the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, 
the enemy not daring to harass the rear of the retiring army, which was his 
usual practice whenever he fell back by way of stratagem rather than from 
panic. It had been the intention of the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name> to help the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>;

but <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> thoroughly cowed them, carrying his arms everywhere, 
and the <name type="ethnic">Marsi</name> who ventured to engage him, he repulsed in a successful 
battle.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>Not long after envoys came 
from <name type="person">Segestes</name>, imploring aid against the violence of his fellow-countrymen, 
by whom he was hemmed in, and with whom <name type="person">Arminius</name> had greater influence, 
because he counselled war. For with barbarians, the more eager a man's 
daring, the more does he inspire confidence, and the more highly is he 
esteemed in times of revolution. With the envoys <name type="person">Segestes</name> had associated his 
son, by name <name type="person">Segimundus</name>, but the youth hung back from a consciousness of 
guilt. For in the year of the revolt of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> he 
had been appointed a priest at the altar of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name>, and had rent the 
sacred garlands, and fled to the rebels. Induced, however, to hope for mercy 
from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, he brought his father's message; he was 
graciously received and sent with an escort to the Gallic bank of the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>.</p>
<p>It was now worth while for <name type="person">Germanicus</name> to march 
back his army. A battle was fought against the besiegers and <name type="person">Segestes</name> was 
rescued with a numerous band of kinsfolk and dependents. In the number were 
some women of rank; among them, the wife of <name type="person">Arminius</name>, who was also the 
daughter of <name type="person">Segestes</name>, but who exhibited the spirit of her husband rather 
than of her father, subdued neither to tears nor to the tones of a 
suppliant, her hands tightly clasped within her bosom, and eyes which dwelt 
on her hope of offspring. The spoils also taken in the defeat of <name type="person">Varus</name> were 
brought in, having been given as plunder to many of those who were then 
being surrendered.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p><name type="person">Segestes</name> too was 
there in person, a stately figure, fearless in the remembrance of having 
been a faithful ally. His speech was to this effect. "This is not my first 
day of steadfast loyalty towards the Roman people. From the time that the 
Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> gave me the citizenship, I have chosen my friends and foes 
with an eye to your advantage, not from hatred of my fatherland (for 
traitors are detested even by those whom they prefer) but because I held 
that <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> and <name type="ethnic"><placeName key="tgn,2088713">Germans</placeName></name> have the same interests, and that peace is better 
than war. And therefore I denounced to <name type="person">Varus</name>, who then commanded your army, 
<name type="person">Arminius</name>, the
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">LOYALTY OF SEGESTES PARTY</note> 
ravisher of 
my daughter, the violater of your treaty. I was put off by that dilatory 
general, and, as I found but little protection in the laws, I urged him to 
arrest myself, <name type="person">Arminius</name>, and his accomplices. That night is my witness; 
would that it had been my last. What followed may be deplored rather than 
defended. However, I threw <name type="person">Arminius</name> into chains and I endured to have them 
put on myself by his partisans. And as soon as you give me opportunity, I 
show my preference for the old over the new, for peace over commotion, not 
to get a reward, but that I may clear myself from treachery and be at the 
same time a fit mediator for a German people, should they choose repentance 
rather than ruin. For the youth and error of my son I entreat forgiveness. 
As for my daughter, I admit that it is by compulsion she has been brought 
here. It will be for you to consider which fact weighs most with you, that 
she is with child by <name type="person">Arminius</name> or that she owes her being to 
me."</p>
<p><name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> in a gracious reply promised safety to his children and 
kinsfolk and a home for himself in the old province. He then led back the 
army and received on the proposal of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> the title of Imperator. The 
wife of <name type="person">Arminius</name> gave birth to a male child; the boy, who was brought up at 
<rs type="placename">Ravenna</rs>, soon afterwards suffered an insult, which 
at the proper time I shall relate.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>The 
report of the surrender and kind reception of <name type="person">Segestes</name>, when generally 
known, was heard with hope or grief according as men shrank from war or 
desired it. <name type="person">Arminius</name>, with his naturally furious temper, was driven to 
frenzy by the seizure of his wife and the foredooming to slavery of his 
wife's unborn child. He flew hither and thither among the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, 
demanding "war against <name type="person">Segestes</name>, war against <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>." And he refrained 
not from taunts. "Noble the father," he would say, "mighty the general, 
brave the army which, with such strength, has carried off one weak woman. 
Before me, three legions, three commanders have fallen. Not by treachery, 
not against pregnant women, but openly against armed men do I wage war. 
There are still to be seen in the groves of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> 
the Roman standards which I hung up to our country's gods. Let <name type="person">Segestes</name> 
dwell on the conquered bank: let him restore to his son his priestly

office; one thing there is which <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> will never thoroughly excuse, 
their having seen between the <rs type="placename">Elbe</rs> and the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> the Roman rods, axes, and toga. Other nations in 
their ignorance of Roman rule, have no experience of punishments, know 
nothing of tributes, and, as we have shaken them off, as the great <name type="person">Augustus</name>, 
ranked among deities, and his chosen heir <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, departed from us, 
baffled, let us not quail before an inexperienced stripling, before a 
mutinous army. If you prefer your fatherland, your ancestors, your ancient 
life to tyrants and to new colonies, follow as your leader <name type="person">Arminius</name> to glory 
and to freedom rather than <name type="person">Segestes</name> to ignominious servitude."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p>This language roused not only the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name> but the 
neighbouring tribes and drew to their side <name type="person">Inguiomerus</name>, the uncle of 
<name type="person">Arminius</name>, who had long been respected by the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. This increased 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s alarm. That the war might not burst in all its fury on one 
point, he sent <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> through the <name type="ethnic">Bructeri</name> to the river <rs type="placename">Amisia</rs> with forty Roman cohorts to distract the enemy, 
while the cavalry was led by its commander <name type="person">Pedo</name> by the territories of the 
<name type="ethnic">Frisii</name>. <name type="person">Germanicus</name> himself put four legions on shipboard and conveyed them 
through the lakes, and the infantry, cavalry, and fleet met simultaneously 
at the river already mentioned. The <name type="ethnic">Chauci</name>, on promising aid, were 
associated with us in military fellowship. <name type="person">Lucius Stertinius</name> was despatched 
by <name type="person">Germanicus</name> with a flying column and routed the <name type="ethnic">Bructeri</name> as they were 
burning their possessions, and amid the carnage and plunder, found the eagle 
of the nineteenth legion which had been lost with <name type="person">Varus</name>. The troops were 
then marched to the furthest frontier of the <name type="ethnic">Bructeri</name>, and all the country 
between the rivers <rs type="placename">Amisia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Luppia</rs> was ravaged, not far from the forest of <rs type="placename">Teutoburgium</rs>, where the remains of <name type="person">Varus</name> and his legions 
were said to lie unburied.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p><name type="person">Germanicus</name> 
upon this was seized with an eager longing to pay the last honour to those 
soldiers and their general, while the whole army present was moved to 
compassion by the thought of their kinsfolk and friends, and, indeed, of the 
calamities of wars and the lot of mankind. Having sent on <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> in 
advance to reconnoitre the obscure forest-passes, and to raise bridges and 
causeways over watery
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">RELICS OF VARUS' DEBACLE</note>
swamps and treacherous plains, they visited the mournful 
scenes, with their horrible sights and associations. <name type="person">Varus</name>'s first camp with 
its wide circumference and the measurements of its central space clearly 
indicated the handiwork of three legions. Further on, the partially fallen 
rampart and the shallow fosse suggested the inference that it was a 
shattered remnant of the army which had there taken up a position. In the 
centre of the field were the whitening bones of men, as they had fled, or 
stood their ground, strewn everywhere or piled in heaps. Near, lay fragments 
of weapons and limbs of horses, and also human heads, prominently nailed to 
trunks of trees. In the adjacent groves were the barbarous altars, on which 
they had immolated tribunes and first-rank centurions. Some survivors of the 
disaster who had escaped from the battle or from captivity, described how 
this was the spot where the officers fell, how yonder the eagles were 
captured, where <name type="person">Varus</name> was pierced by his first wound, where too by the 
stroke of his own ill-starred hand he found for himself death. They pointed 
out too the raised ground from which <name type="person">Arminius</name> had harangued his army, the 
number of gibbets for the captives, the pits for the living, and how in his 
exultation he insulted the standards and eagles.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>And so the Roman army now on the spot, six years after the 
disaster, in grief and anger, began to bury the bones of the three legions, 
not a soldier knowing whether he was interring the relics of a relative or a 
stranger, but looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood, while their 
wrath rose higher than ever against the foe. In raising the barrow 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> laid the first sod, rendering thus a most welcome honour to the 
dead, and sharing also in the sorrow of those present. This <name type="person">Tiberius</name> did not 
approve, either interpreting unfavourably every act of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, or 
because he thought that the spectacle of the slain and unburied made the 
army slow to fight and more afraid of the enemy, and that a general invested 
with the augurate and its very ancient ceremonies ought not to have polluted 
himself with funeral rites.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p><name type="person">Germanicus</name>, however, pursued <name type="person">Arminius</name> as he fell back into trackless wilds, 
and as soon as he had the opportunity, ordered his cavalry to sally forth 
and scour the plains

occupied by the enemy. <name type="person">Arminius</name> having bidden 
his men to concentrate themselves and keep close to the woods, suddenly 
wheeled round, and soon gave those whom he had concealed in the 
forest-passes the signal to rush to the attack. Thereupon our cavalry was 
thrown into disorder by this new force, and some cohorts in reserve were 
sent, which, broken by the shock of flying troops, increased the panic. They 
were being pushed into a swamp, well known to the victorious assailants, 
perilous to men unacquainted with it, when <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> led forth his legions 
in battle array. This struck terror into the enemy and gave confidence to 
our men, and they separated without advantage to either.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> led back his army to the <rs type="placename">Amisia</rs>, taking 
his legions by the fleet, as he had brought them up. Part of the cavalry was 
ordered to make for the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> along the sea-coast. 
<name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name>, who commanded a division of his own, was advised, though he 
was returning by a route which he knew, to pass <rs type="placename">Long Bridges</rs> with all 
possible speed. This was a narrow road amid vast swamps, which had formerly 
been constructed by <name type="person">Lucius Domitius</name>; on every side were quagmires of thick 
clinging mud, or perilous with streams. Around were woods on a gradual 
slope, which <name type="person">Arminius</name> now completely occupied, as soon as by a short route 
and quick march he had outstripped troops heavily laden with baggage and 
arms. As <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> was in doubt how he could possibly replace bridges 
which were ruinous from age, and at the same time hold back the enemy, he 
resolved to encamp on the spot, that some might begin the repair and others 
the attack.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>The barbarians attempted 
to break through the outposts and to throw themselves on the engineering 
parties, which they harassed, pacing round them and continually charging 
them. There was a confused din from the men at work and the combatants. 
Everything alike was unfavourable to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, the place with its deep 
swamps, insecure to the foot and slippery as one advanced, limbs burdened 
with coats of mail, and the impossibility of aiming their javelins amid the 
water. The <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, on the other hand, were familiar with fighting in fens; 
they had huge frames, and lances long enough to inflict wounds even at a 
distance.

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE</note> 
Night at last 
released the legions, which were now wavering, from a disastrous engagement. 
The <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> whom success rendered unwearied, without even then taking any 
rest, turned all the streams which rose from the slopes of the surrounding 
hills into the lands beneath. The ground being thus flooded and the 
completed portion of our works submerged, the soldiers' labour was doubled. </p>
<p>This was <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name>'s fortieth campaign as a subordinate or a 
commander, and, with such experience of success and peril, he was perfectly 
fearless. As he thought over future possibilities, he could devise no plan 
but to keep the enemy within the woods, till the wounded and the more 
encumbered troops were in advance. For between the hills and the swamps 
there stretched a plain which would admit of an extended line. The legions 
had their assigned places, the fifth on the right wing, the twenty-first on 
the left, the men of the first to lead the van, the twentieth to repel 
pursuers.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>It was a restless night for 
different reasons, the barbarians in their festivity filling the valleys 
under the hills and the echoing glens with merry song or savage shouts, 
while in the Roman camp were flickering fires, broken exclamations, and the 
men lay scattered along the intrenchments or wandered from tent to tent, 
wakeful rather than watchful. A ghastly dream appalled the general. He 
seemed to see <name type="person">Quintilius Varus</name>, covered with blood, rising out of the 
swamps, and to hear him, as it were, calling to him, but he did not, as he 
imagined, obey the call; he even repelled his hand, as he stretched it over 
him. At daybreak the legions, posted on the wings, from panic or perversity, 
deserted their position and hastily occupied a plain beyond the morass. Yet 
<name type="person">Arminius</name>, though free to attack, did not at the moment rush out on them. But 
when the baggage was clogged in the mud and in the fosses, the soldiers 
around it in disorder, the array of the standards in confusion, every one in 
selfish haste and all ears deaf to the word of command, he ordered the 
Germans to charge, exclaiming again and again, "Behold a <name type="person">Varus</name> and legions 
once more entangled in <name type="person">Varus</name>'s fate." As he spoke, he cut through the column 
with some picked men, inflicting wounds chiefly on the horses. Staggering in 
their blood on the slippery marsh, they

shook off their riders, 
driving hither and thither all in their way, and trampling on the fallen. 
The struggle was hottest round the eagles, which could neither be carried in 
the face of the storm of missiles, nor planted in the miry soil. 
<name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name>, while he was keeping up the battle, fell from his horse, which 
was pierced under him, and was being hemmed in, when the first legion threw 
itself in the way. The greed of the foe helped him, for they left the 
slaughter to secure the spoil, and the legions, towards evening, struggled 
on to open and firm ground.</p>
<p>Nor did this end their miseries. 
Entrenchments had to be thrown up, materials sought for earthworks, while 
the army had lost to a great extent their implements for digging earth and 
cutting turf. There were no tents for the rank and file, no comforts for the 
wounded. As they shared their food, soiled by mire or blood, they bewailed 
the darkness with its awful omen, and the one day which yet remained to so 
many thousand men.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>It chanced that a 
horse, which had broken its halter and wandered wildly in fright at the 
uproar, overthrew some men against whom it dashed. Thence arose such a 
panic, from the belief that the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> had burst into the camp, that all 
rushed to the gates. Of these the decuman gate was the point chiefly sought, 
as it was furthest from the enemy and safer for flight. <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name>, having 
ascertained that the alarm was groundless, yet being unable to stop or stay 
the soldiers by authority or entreaties or even by force, threw himself to 
the earth in the gateway, and at last by an appeal to their pity, as they 
would have had to pass over the body of their commander, closed the way. At 
the same moment the tribunes and the centurions convinced them that it was a 
false alarm.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p>Having then assembled 
them at his headquarters, and ordered them to hear his words in silence, he 
reminded them of the urgency of the crisis. "Their safety," he said, "lay in 
their arms, which they must, however, use with discretion, and they must 
remain within the entrenchments, till the enemy approached closer, in the 
hope of storming them; then, there must be a general sortie; by that sortie 
the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> might be reached. Whereas if they fled, 
more forests, deeper

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MORALE OF THE ARMIES</note> 
swamps, 
and a savage foe awaited them; but if they were victorious, glory and renown 
would be theirs." He dwelt on all that was dear to them at home, all that 
testified to their honour in the camp, without any allusion to disaster. 
Next he handed over the horses, beginning with his own, of the officers and 
tribunes, to the bravest fighters in the army, quite impartially, that these 
first, and then the infantry, might charge the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>There was as much restlessness in the German host 
with its hopes, its eager longings, and the conflicting opinions of its 
chiefs. <name type="person">Arminius</name> advised that they should allow the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> to quit their 
position, and, when they had quitted it, again surprise them in swampy and 
intricate ground. <name type="person">Inguiomerus</name>, with fiercer counsels, heartily welcome to 
barbarians, was for beleaguering the entrenchment in armed array, as to 
storm them would, he said, be easy, and there would be more prisoners and 
the booty unspoilt. So at day-break they trampled in the fosses, flung 
hurdles into them, seized the upper part of the breastwork, where the troops 
were thinly distributed and seemingly paralysed by fear. When they were 
fairly within the fortifications, the signal was given to the cohorts, and 
the horns and trumpets sounded. Instantly, with a shout and sudden rush, our 
men threw themselves on the German rear, with taunts, that here were no 
woods or swamps, but that they were on equal ground, with equal chances. The 
sound of trumpets, the gleam of arms, which were so unexpected, burst with 
all the greater effect on the enemy, thinking only, as they were, of the 
easy destruction of a few half-armed men, and they were struck down, as 
unprepared for a reverse as they had been elated by success. <name type="person">Arminius</name> and 
<name type="person">Inguiomerus</name> fled from the battle, the first unhurt, the other severely 
wounded. Their followers were slaughtered, as long as our fury and the light 
of day lasted. It was not till night that the legions returned, and though 
more wounds and the same want of provisions distressed them, yet they found 
strength, healing, sustenance, everything indeed, in their 
victory.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p>Meanwhile a rumour had spread 
that our army was cut off, and that a furious German host was marching on 
<rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>. And had not <name type="person">Agrippina</name> prevented the bridge 
over the

<rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> from being destroyed, some 
in their cowardice would have dared that base act. A woman of heroic spirit, 
she assumed during those days the duties of a general, and distributed 
clothes or medicine among the soldiers, as they were destitute or wounded. 
According to <name type="person">Caius Plinius</name>, the historian of the German wars, she stood at 
the extremity of the bridge, and bestowed praise and thanks on the returning 
legions. This made a deep impression on the mind of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. "Such zeal," 
he thought, "could not be guileless; it was not against a foreign foe that 
she was thus courting the soldiers. Generals had nothing left them when a 
woman went among the companies, attended the standards, ventured on bribery, 
as though it showed but slight ambition to parade her son in a common 
soldier's uniform, and wish him to be called <name type="person">C&aelig;sar Caligula</name>. <name type="person">Agrippina</name> 
had now more power with the armies than officers, than generals. A woman had 
quelled a mutiny which the sovereign's name could not check." All this was 
inflamed and aggravated by <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, who, with his thorough comprehension of 
the character of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, sowed for a distant future hatreds which the 
emperor might treasure up and might exhibit when fully matured.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p>Of the legions which he had conveyed by ship, 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> gave the second and fourteenth to <name type="person">Publius Vitellius</name>, to be 
marched by land, so that the fleet might sail more easily over a sea full of 
shoals, or take the ground more lightly at the ebb-tide. <name type="person">Vitellius</name> at first 
pursued his route without interruption, having a dry shore, or the waves 
coming in gently. After a while, through the force of the north wind and the 
equinoctial season, when the sea swells to its highest, his army was driven 
and tossed hither and thither. The country too was flooded; sea, shore, 
fields presented one aspect, nor could the treacherous quicksands be 
distinguished from solid ground or shallows from deep water. Men were swept 
away by the waves or sucked under by eddies; beasts of burden, baggage, 
lifeless bodies floated about and blocked their way. The companies were 
mingled in confusion, now with the breast, now with the head only above 
water, sometimes losing their footing and parted from their comrades or 
drowned. The voice of mutual encourage-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AGRIPPINA HELPS 
LEGIONS ESCAPE</note> 
ment availed not against the adverse force of the 
waves. There was nothing to distinguish the brave from the coward, the 
prudent from the careless, forethought from chance; the same strong power 
swept everything before it. At last <name type="person">Vitellius</name> struggled out to higher ground 
and led his men up to it. There they passed the night, without necessary 
food, without fire, many of them with bare or bruised limbs, in a plight as 
pitiable as that of men besieged by an enemy. For such, at least, have the 
opportunity of a glorious death, while here was destruction without honour. 
Daylight restored land to their sight, and they pushed their way to the 
river <rs type="placename">Visurgis</rs>, where <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> had arrived with 
the fleet. The legions then embarked, while a rumour was flying about that 
they were drowned. Nor was there a belief in their safety till they saw 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> and the army returned.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>By 
this time <name type="person">Stertinius</name>, who had been despatched to receive the surrender of 
<name type="person">Segimerus</name>, brother of <name type="person">Segestes</name>, had conducted the chief, together with his 
son, to the canton of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name>. Both were pardoned, <name type="person">Segimerus</name> readily, the 
son with some hesitation, because it was said that he had insulted the 
corpse of <name type="person">Quintilius Varus</name>. Meanwhile <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>, and <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> vied in 
repairing the losses of the army, offering whatever they had at hand, arms, 
horses, gold. <name type="person">Germanicus</name> having praised their zeal, took only for the war 
their arms and horses, and relieved the soldiers out of his own purse. And 
that he might also soften the remembrance of the disaster by kindness, he 
went round to the wounded, applauded the feats of soldier after soldier, 
examined their wounds, raised the hopes of one, the ambition of another, and 
the spirits of all by his encouragement and interest, thus strengthening 
their ardour for himself and for battle.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>That year triumphal honours were decreed to <name type="person">Aulus C&aelig;cina</name>, 
<name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>, <name type="person">Caius Silius</name> for their achievements under <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. The 
title of "father of his country," which the people had so often thrust on 
him, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> refused, nor would he allow obedience to be sworn to his 
enactments, though the Senate voted it, for he said repeatedly that all 
human things were uncertain, and that the more he had obtained, the more 
precarious was his position. But he did not thereby create a belief in his 
patriotism, for he

had revived the law of treason, the name of 
which indeed was known in ancient times, though other matters came under its 
jurisdiction, such as the betrayal of an army, or seditious stirring up of 
the people, or, in short, any corrupt act by which a man had impaired "the 
majesty of the people of 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>." Deeds only were 
liable to accusation; words went unpunished. It was <name type="person">Augustus</name> who first, 
under colour of this law, applied legal inquiry to libellous writings, 
provoked, as he had been, by the licentious freedom with which <name type="person">Cassius 
Severus</name> had defamed men and women of distinction in his insulting satires. 
Soon afterwards, <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, when consulted by <name type="person">Pompeius Macer</name>, the 
pr&aelig;tor, as to whether prosecutions for treason should be revived, 
replied that the laws must be enforced. He too had been exasperated by the 
publication of verses of uncertain authorship, pointed at his cruelty, his 
arrogance, and his dissensions with his mother.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>It will not be uninteresting if I relate in the cases of 
<name type="person">Falanius</name> and <name type="person">Rubrius</name>, Roman knights of moderate fortune, the first 
experiments at such accusations, in order to explain the origin of a most 
terrible scourge, how by <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s cunning it crept in among us, how 
subsequently it was checked, finally, how it burst into flame and consumed 
everything. Against <name type="person">Falanius</name> it was alleged by his accuser that he had 
admitted among the votaries of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, who in every great house were 
associated into a kind of brotherhood, one <name type="person">Cassius</name>, a buffoon of infamous 
life, and that he had also in selling his gardens included in the sale a 
statue of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. Against <name type="person">Rubrius</name> the charge was that he had violated by 
perjury the divinity of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. When this was known to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, he wrote 
to the consuls "that his father had not had a place in heaven decreed to 
him, that the honour might be turned to the destruction of the citizens. 
<name type="person">Cassius</name>, the actor, with men of the same profession, used to take part in 
the games which had been consecrated by his mother to the memory of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>. Nor was it contrary to the religion of the State for the emperor's 
image, like those of other deities, to be added to a sale of gardens and 
houses. As to the oath, the thing ought to be considered as if the man had 
deceived <name type="person">Jupiter</name>. Wrongs done to the gods were the gods' 
concern."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>Not long afterwards, <name type="person">Granius 
Marcellus</name>, proconsul of

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TIBERIUS' PROSECUTIONS FOR 
TREASON</note>
<rs type="placename">Bithynia</rs>, was accused of treason by his quaestor, <name type="person">C&aelig;pio 
Crispinus</name>, and the charge was supported by <name type="person">Romanus Hispo</name>. <name type="person">Crispinus</name> then 
entered on a line of life afterwards rendered notorious by the miseries of 
the age and men's shamelessness. Needy, obscure, and restless, he wormed 
himself by stealthy informations into the confidence of a vindictive prince, 
and soon imperilled all the most distinguished citizens; and having thus 
gained influence with one, hatred from all besides, he left an example in 
following which beggars became wealthy, the insignificant, formidable, and 
brought ruin first on others, finally on themselves. He alleged against 
<name type="person">Marcellus</name> that he had made some disrespectful remarks about <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, a 
charge not to be evaded, inasmuch as the accuser selected the worst features 
of the emperor's character and grounded his case on them. The things were 
true, and so were believed to have been said. </p><p><name type="person">Hispo</name> added that <name type="person">Marcellus</name> 
had placed his own statue above those of the C&aelig;sars, and had set the 
bust of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> on another statue from which he had struck off the head of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>. At this the emperor's wrath blazed forth, and, breaking through 
his habitual silence, he exclaimed that in such a case he would himself too 
give his vote openly on oath, that the rest might be under the same 
obligation. There lingered even then a few signs of expiring freedom. And so 
<name type="person">Cneius Piso</name> asked, "In what order will you vote, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>? If first, I 
shall know what to follow; if last, I fear that I may differ from you 
unwillingly." <name type="person">Tiberius</name> was deeply moved, and repenting of the outburst, all 
the more because of its thoughtlessness, he quietly allowed the accused to 
be acquitted of the charges of treason. As for the question of extortion, it 
was referred to a special commission.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p>Not satisfied with judicial proceedings in the Senate: the emperor would sit 
at one end of the Pr&aelig;tor's tribunal, but so as not to displace him 
from the official seat. Many decisions were given in his presence, in 
opposition to improper influence and the solicitations of great men. This, 
though it promoted justice, ruined freedom. <name type="person">Pius Aurelius</name>, for example, a 
senator, complained that the foundations of his house had been weakened by 
the pressure of a public road and aqueduct, and he appealed to the Senate 
for assistance.

He was opposed by the pr&aelig;tors of the 
treasury, but the emperor helped him, and paid him the value of his house, 
for he liked to spend money on a good purpose, a virtue which he long 
retained, when he cast off all others. To <name type="person">Propertius Celer</name>, an 
ex-pr&aelig;tor, who sought because of his indigence to be excused from his 
rank as a senator, he gave a million sesterces, having ascertained that he 
had inherited poverty. He bade others, who attempted the same, prove their 
case to the Senate, as from his love of strictness he was harsh even where 
he acted on right grounds. Consequently every one else preferred silence and 
poverty to confession and relief.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="76"><p>In 
the same year the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, swollen by continuous 
rains, flooded the level portions of the city. Its subsidence was followed 
by a destruction of buildings and of life. Thereupon <name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name> proposed 
to consult the Sibylline books. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> refused, veiling in obscurity the 
divine as well as the human. However, the devising of means to confine the 
river was intrusted to <name type="person">Ateius Capito</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Arruntius</name>.</p>
<p><rs type="placename">Achaia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Macedonia</rs>, on 
complaining of their burdens, were, it was decided, to be relieved for a 
time from pro-consular government and to be transferred to the emperor. 
<name type="person">Drusus</name> presided over a show of gladiators which he gave in his own name and 
in that of his brother <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, for he gloated intensely over bloodshed, 
however cheap its victims. This was alarming to the populace, and his father 
had, it was said, rebuked him. Why <name type="person">Tiberius</name> kept away from the spectacle was 
variously explained. According to some, it was his loathing of a crowd, 
according to others, his gloomy temper, and a fear of contrast with the 
gracious presence of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. I cannot believe that he deliberately gave 
his son the opportunity of displaying his ferocity and provoking the 
people's disgust, though even this was said.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="77"><p>Meanwhile the unruly tone of the theatre which first showed 
itself in the preceding year, broke out with worse violence, and some 
soldiers and a centurion, besides several of the populace, were killed, and 
the tribune of a pr&aelig;torian cohort was wounded, while they were trying 
to stop insults to the magistrates and the strife of the mob. This 
disturbance was the subject of a debate in the Senate, and opinions
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IMPERIAL BENEFACTIONS</note> 
were expressed in favour of the 
pr&aelig;tors having authority to scourge actors. <name type="person">Haterius Agrippa</name>, tribune 
of the people, interposed his veto, and was sharply censured in a speech 
from <name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name>, without a word from <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, who liked to allow the 
Senate such shows of freedom. Still the interposition was successful, 
because <name type="person">Augustus</name> had once pronounced that actors were exempt from the 
scourge, and it was not lawful for <name type="person">Tiberius</name> to infringe his decisions. Many 
enactments were passed to fix the amount of their pay and to check the 
disorderly behaviour of their partisans. Of these the chief were that no 
Senator should enter the house of a pantomime player, that Roman knights 
should not crowd round them in the public streets, that they should exhibit 
themselves only in the theatre, and that the pr&aelig;tors should be 
empowered to punish with banishment any riotous conduct in the 
spectators.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="78"><p>A request from the 
<name type="ethnic">Spaniards</name> that they might erect a temple to <name type="person">Augustus</name> in the colony of 
<rs type="placename">Tarraco</rs> was granted, and a precedent thus given for all the provinces. When 
the people of 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> asked for a remission of the one 
per cent. tax on all saleable commodities, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> declared by edict "that 
the military exchequer depended on that branch of revenue, and, further, 
that the State was unequal to the burden, unless the twentieth year of 
service were to be that of the veteran's discharge." Thus the ill-advised 
results of the late mutiny, by which a limit of sixteen campaigns had been 
extorted, were cancelled for the future.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="79"><p>A question was then raised in the Senate by <name type="person">Arruntius</name> and <name type="person">Ateius</name> 
whether, in order to restrain the inundations of the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, the rivers and lakes which swell its waters 
should be diverted from their courses. A hearing was given to embassies from 
the municipal towns and colonies, and the people of <rs type="placename">Florentia</rs> begged that the <rs type="placename">Clanis</rs> 
might not be turned out of its channel and made to flow into the <rs type="placename">Arnus</rs>, as that would bring ruin on themselves. Similar 
arguments were used by the inhabitants of <rs type="placename">Interamna</rs>. 
The most fruitful plains of <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, they said, would 
be destroyed if the river <rs type="placename">Nar</rs> (for this was the plan 
proposed) were to be divided into several streams and overflow the country. 
Nor did the people of <rs type="placename">Reate,</rs> remain silent. They 
remonstrated against the clos-

ing up of the <rs type="placename">Veline lake</rs>, where it empties itself into the <rs type="placename">Nar</rs>, "as it would burst in a flood on the entire 
neighbourhood. Nature had admirably provided for human interests in having 
assigned to rivers their mouths, their channels, and their limits, as well 
as their sources. Regard, too, must be paid to the different religions of 
the allies, who had dedicated sacred rites, groves, and altars to the rivers 
of their country. <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs> himself would be altogether 
unwilling to be deprived of his neighbour streams and to flow with less 
glory." Either the entreaties of the colonies, or the difficulty of the work 
or superstitious motives prevailed, and they yielded to <name type="person">Piso</name>'s opinion, who 
declared himself against any change.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="80"><p><name type="person">Popp&aelig;us Sabinus</name> was continued in his government of the province of <rs type="placename">Moesia</rs> with the addition of <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Macedonia</rs>. It was 
part of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>' character to prolong indefinitely military commands and to 
keep many men to the end of their life with the same armies and in the same 
administrations. Various motives have been assigned for this. Some say that, 
out of aversion to any fresh anxiety, he retained what he had once approved 
as a permanent arrangement; others, that he grudged to see many enjoying 
promotion. Some, again, think that though he had an acute intellect, his 
judgment was irresolute, for he did not seek out eminent merit, and yet he 
detested vice. From the best men he apprehended danger to himself, from the 
worst, disgrace to the State. He went so far at last in this irresolution, 
that he appointed to provinces men whom he did not mean to allow to leave 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="81"><p>I can 
hardly venture on any positive statement about the consular elections, now 
held for the first time under this emperor, or, indeed, subsequently, so 
conflicting are the accounts we find not only in historians but in <name type="person">Tiberius</name>' 
own speeches. Sometimes he kept back the names of the candidates, describing 
their origin, their life and military career, so that it might be understood 
who they were. Occasionally even these hints were withheld, and, after 
urging them not to disturb the elections by canvassing, he would promise his 
own help towards the result. Generally he declared that only those had 
offered themselves to him as candidates whose
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROLONGED 
TERMS OF GOVERNORS</note>
names he had given to the consuls, and that others 
might offer themselves if they had confidence in their influence or merit. A 
plausible profession this in words, but really unmeaning and delusive, and 
the greater the disguise of freedom which marked it, the more cruel the 
enslavement into which it was soon to plunge us.</p></div2></div1>

<head>BOOK II</head>
<head><dateRange from="16" to="19">A.D. I6&mdash;I9</dateRange></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>IN 
the consulship of <name type="person">Sisenna Statilius Taurus</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Libo</name> there was a 
commotion in the kingdoms and Roman provinces of the East. It had its origin 
among the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, who disdained as a foreigner a king whom they had 
sought and received from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, though he was of the 
family of the <name type="ethnic">Arsacids</name>. This was <name type="person">Vonones</name>, who had been given as an hostage 
to <name type="person">Augustus</name> by <name type="person">Phraates</name>. For although he had driven before him armies and 
generals from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, <name type="person">Phraates</name> had shown to <name type="person">Augustus</name> 
every token of reverence and had sent him some of his children, to cement 
the friendship, not so much from dread of us as from distrust of the loyalty 
of his countrymen. </p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>After the death of 
<name type="person">Phraates</name> and the succeeding kings in the bloodshed of civil wars, there came 
to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> envoys from the chief men of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs>, in quest of <name type="person">Vonones</name>, his eldest son. 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> thought this a great honour to himself, and loaded <name type="person">Vonones</name> with 
wealth. The barbarians, too, welcomed him with rejoicing, as is usual with 
new rulers. Soon they felt shame at <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> having become degenerate, at 
their having sought a king from another world, one too infected with the 
training of the enemy, at the throne of the <name type="ethnic">Arsacids</name> now being possessed and 
given away among the provinces of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. "Where," 
they asked, "was the glory of the men who slew <name type="person">Crassus</name>, who drove out 
<name type="person">Antonius</name>, if <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s drudge, after an endurance of so many years' 
slavery, were to rule over <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>." </p>
<p><name type="person">Vonones</name> himself too further 
provoked their disdain, by his contrast with their ancestral manners, by his 
rare indulgence in the chase, by his feeble interest in horses, by the 
litter in which he was carried whenever he made a progress through their 
cities, and by his contemptuous dislike of their

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">COMMOTIONS 
IN THE EAST</note>
national festivities. They also ridiculed his Greek 
attendants and his keeping under seal the commonest household articles. But 
he was easy of approach; his courtesy was open to all, and he had thus 
virtues with which the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> were unfamiliar, and vices new to them. And 
as his ways were quite alien from theirs they hated alike what was bad and 
what was good in him. </p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>Accordingly they 
summoned <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, an <name type="ethnic">Arsacid</name> by blood, who had grown to manhood among the 
<name type="ethnic">Dahae</name>, and who, though routed in the first encounter, rallied his forces and 
possessed himself of the kingdom. The conquered <name type="person">Vonones</name> found a refuge in 
<rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, then a free country, and exposed to the 
power of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, 
without being trusted by either, in consequence of the crime of <name type="person">Antonius</name>, 
who, under the guise of friendship, had inveigled <name type="person">Artavasdes</name>, king of the 
<name type="ethnic">Armenians</name>, then loaded him with chains, and finally murdered him. His son, 
<name type="person">Artaxias</name>, our bitter foe because of his father's memory, found defence for 
himself and his kingdom in the might of the <name type="ethnic">Arsacids</name>. When he was slain by 
the treachery of kinsmen, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> gave <name type="person">Tigranes</name> to the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name>, and he 
was put in possession of the kingdom under the escort of <name type="person">Tiberius Nero</name>. But 
neither <name type="person">Tigranes</name> nor his children reigned long, though, in foreign fashion, 
they were united in marriage and in royal power. </p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>Next, at the bidding of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, <name type="person">Artavasdes</name> was set on the 
throne, nor was he deposed without disaster to ourselves. <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> 
was then appointed to restore order in <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>. He 
put over the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> <name type="person">Ariobarzanes</name>, a <name type="ethnic">Mede</name> by birth, whom they willingly 
accepted, because of his singularly handsome person and noble spirit. On the 
death of <name type="person">Ariobarzanes</name> through a fatal accident, they would not endure his 
son. Having tried the government of a woman named <name type="person">Erato</name> and having soon 
afterwards driven her from them, bewildered and disorganised, rather indeed 
without a ruler than enjoying freedom, they received for their king the 
fugitive <name type="person">Vonones</name>. When, however, <name type="person">Artabanus</name> began to threaten, and but feeble 
support could be given by the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name>, or war with <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> would have to be undertaken, if <name type="person">Vonones</name> was to 
be upheld by our arms, the governor of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, 
<name type="person">Creticus Silanus</name>, sent for him and kept him

under surveillance, 
letting him retain his royal pomp and title. How <name type="person">Vonones</name> meditated an escape 
from this mockery, I will relate in the proper place.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>Meanwhile the commotion in the East was rather 
pleasing to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, as it was a pretext for withdrawing <name type="person">Germanicus</name> from 
the legions which knew him well, and placing him over new provinces where he 
would be exposed both to treachery and to disasters. <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, however, in 
proportion to the strength of the soldiers' attachment and to his uncle's 
dislike, was eager to hasten his victory, and he pondered on plans of 
battle, and on the reverses or successes which during more than three years 
of war had fallen to his lot. The <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, he knew, were beaten in the field 
and on fair ground; they were helped by woods, swamps, short summers, and 
early winters. His own troops were affected not so much by wounds as by long 
marches and damage to their arms. <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs> had been 
exhausted by supplying horses; a long baggage-train presented facilities for 
ambuscades, and was embarrassing to its defenders. But by embarking on the 
sea, invasion would be easy for them, and a surprise to the enemy, while a 
campaign too would be more quickly begun, the legions and supplies would be 
brought up simultaneously, and the cavalry with their horses would arrive,

<name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> had the charge of building a fleet. It seemed that a thousand 
vessels were required, and they were speedily constructed, some of small 
draught with a narrow stem and stern and a broad centre, that they might 
bear the waves more easily; some flat-bottomed, that they might ground 
without being injured; several, furnished with a rudder at each end, so that 
by a sudden shifting of the oars they might be run into shore either way. 
Many were covered in with decks, on which engines for missiles might be 
conveyed, and were also fit for the carrying of horses or supplies, and 
being equipped with sails as well as rapidly moved by oars, they assumed, 
through the enthusiasm of our soldiers, an imposing and formidable 
aspect.

CAMPAIGN</note></p>
<p>The <rs type="placename">island of the Batavi</rs> was the 
appointed rendezvous because of its easy landing-places, and its convenience 
for receiving the army and carrying the war across the river. For the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> after flowing continuously in a single channel or 
encircling merely insignificant islands, divides itself, so to say, where 
the Batavian territory begins, into two rivers, retaining its name and the 
rapidity of its course in the stream which washes <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, till it mingles with the ocean. On the Gallic 
bank, its flow is broader and gentler; it is called by an altered name, the 
<rs type="placename">Vahal</rs>, by the inhabitants of its shore. Soon that 
name too is changed for the <rs type="placename">Mosa</rs> river, through 
whose vast mouth it empties itself into the same ocean.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p><name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, however, while the vessels were coming 
up, ordered <name type="person">Silius</name>, his lieutenant-general, to make an inroad on the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name> 
with a flying column. He himself, on hearing that a fort on the river <rs type="placename">Luppia</rs> was being besieged, led six legions to the spot. 
<name type="person">Silius</name> owing to sudden rains did nothing but carry off a small booty, and 
the wife and daughter of <name type="person">Arpus</name>, the chief of the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>. And <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> had 
no opportunity of fighting given him by the besiegers, who dispersed on the 
rumour of his advance. They had, however, destroyed the barrow lately raised 
in memory of <name type="person">Varus</name>'s legions, and the old altar of <name type="person">Drusus</name>. The prince 
restored the altar, and himself with his legions celebrated funeral games in 
his father's honour. To raise a new barrow was not thought necessary. All 
the country between the fort <rs type="placename">Aliso</rs> and the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> was 
thoroughly secured by new barriers and earthworks.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>By this time the fleet had arrived, and <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, 
having sent on his supplies and assigned vessels for the legions and the 
allied troops, entered "<name type="person">Drusus</name>'s fosse," as it was called. He prayed <name type="person">Drusus</name> 
his father to lend him, now that he was venturing on the same enterprise, 
the willing and favourable aid of the example and memory of his counsels and 
achievements, and he arrived after a prosperous voyage through the lakes and 
the ocean as far as the river <rs type="placename">Amisia</rs>. His fleet 
remained there on the left bank of the stream, and it was a blunder that he 
did not have it brought up the river. He disembarked the troops, which were 
to be marched to the country on the right, and thus several days were wasted 
in

the construction of bridges. The cavalry and the legions 
fearlessly crossed the first estuaries in which the tide had not yet risen. 
The rear of the auxiliaries, and the <name type="ethnic">Batavi</name> among the number, plunging 
recklessly into the water and displaying their skill in swimming, fell into 
disorder, and some were drowned. While <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> was measuring out his 
camp, he was told of a revolt of the Angrivarii in his rear. He at once 
despatched <name type="person">Stertinius</name> with some cavalry and a light armed force, who 
punished their perfidy with fire and sword.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>The waters of the <rs type="placename">Visurgis</rs> flowed between 
the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>. On its banks stood <name type="person">Arminius</name> with the other 
chiefs. He asked whether <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> had arrived, and on the reply that he 
was present, he begged leave to have an interview with his brother. That 
brother, surnamed <name type="person">Flavus</name>, was with our army, a man famous for his loyalty, 
and for having lost an eye by a wound, a few years ago, when <name type="person">Tiberius</name> was in 
command. The permission was then given, and he stepped forth and was saluted 
by <name type="person">Arminius</name>, who had removed his guards to a distance and required that the 
bowmen ranged on our bank should retire. When they had gone away, <name type="person">Arminius</name> 
asked his brother whence came the scar which disfigured his face, and on 
being told the particular place and battle, he inquired what reward he had 
received. <name type="person">Flavus</name> spoke of increased pay, of a neck chain, a crown, and other 
military gifts, while <name type="person">Arminius</name> jeered at such a paltry recompense for 
slavery.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>Then began a controversy. 
The one spoke of the greatness of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, the 
resources of <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, the dreadful punishment in store for the 
vanquished, the ready mercy for him who surrenders, and the fact that 
neither <name type="person">Arminius</name>'s wife nor his son were treated as enemies; the other, of 
the claims of fatherland, of ancestral freedom, of the gods of the homes of 
<rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, of the mother who shared his prayers, that 
<name type="person">Flavus</name> might not choose to be the deserter and betrayer rather than the 
ruler of his kinsfolk and relatives, and indeed of his own people. </p>
<p>By 
degrees they fell to bitter words, and even the river between them would not 
have hindered them from joining combat, had not <name type="person">Stertinius</name> hurried up and 
put his hand on

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MANOEUVRES AT WESER</note>
<name type="person">Flavus</name>, who in 
the full tide of his fury was demanding his weapons and his charger. 
<name type="person">Arminius</name> was seen facing him, full of menaces and challenging him to 
conflict. Much of what he said was in Roman speech, for he had served in our 
camp as leader of his fellow-countrymen.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>Next day the German army took up its position on the other side 
of the <rs type="placename">Visurgis</rs>. <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, thinking that without 
bridges and troops to guard them, it would not be good generalship to expose 
the legions to danger, sent the cavalry across the river by the fords. It 
was commanded by <name type="person">Stertinius</name> and <name type="person">Aemilius</name>, one of the first rank centurions, 
who attacked at widely different points so as to distract the enemy, 
<name type="person">Chariovalda</name>, the Batavian chief, dashed to the charge where the stream is 
most rapid. The <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, by a pretended flight, drew him into a plain 
surrounded by forest-passes. Then bursting on him in a sudden attack from 
all points they thrust aside all who resisted, pressed fiercely on their 
retreat, driving them before them, when they rallied in compact array, some 
by close fighting, others by missiles from a distance. <name type="person">Chariovalda</name>, after 
long sustaining the enemy's fury, cheered on his men to break by a dense 
formation the onset of their bands, while he himself, plunging into the 
thickest of the battle, fell amid a shower of darts with his horse pierced 
under him, and round him many noble chiefs. The rest were rescued from the 
peril by their own strength, or by the cavalry which came up with <name type="person">Stertinius</name> 
and <name type="person">Aemilius</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p><name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> on crossing 
the <rs type="placename">Visurgis</rs> learnt by the information of a deserter 
that <name type="person">Arminius</name> had chosen a battle-field, that other tribes too had assembled 
in a forest sacred to <name type="person">Hercules</name>, and would venture on a night attack on his 
camp. He put faith in this intelligence, and, besides, several watch-fires 
were seen. Scouts also, who had crept close up to the enemy, reported that 
they had heard the neighing of horses and the hum of a huge and tumultuous 
host. And so thinking, as the decisive crisis drew near, that he ought 
thoroughly to sound the temper of his soldiers, he considered with himself 
how this was to be accomplished with a genuine result. Tribunes and 
centurions, he knew, oftener reported what was welcome than what was true; 
freedmen had slavish

spirits, friends a love of flattery. If an 
assembly were called, there too the lead of a few was followed by the shout 
of the many. He must probe their inmost thoughts, when they were uttering 
their hopes and fears at the military mess, among themselves, and 
unwatched.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>At nightfall, leaving his 
tent of augury by a secret exit, unknown to the sentries, with one 
companion, his shoulders covered with a wild beast's skin, he visited the 
camp streets, stood by the tents, and enjoyed the men's talk about himself, 
as one extolled his noble rank, another, his handsome person, nearly all of 
them, his endurance, his gracious manner and the evenness of his temper, 
whether he was jesting or was serious, while they acknowledged that they 
ought to repay him with their gratitude in battle, and at the same time 
sacrifice to a glorious vengeance the perfidious violators of peace. 
Meanwhile one of the enemy, acquainted with the Roman tongue, spurred his 
horse up to the entrenchments, and in a loud voice promised in the name of 
<name type="person">Arminius</name> to all deserters wives and lands with daily pay of a hundred 
sesterces as long as war lasted. The insult fired the wrath of the legions. 
"Let daylight come," they said, "let battle be given. The soldiers will 
possess themselves of the lands of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> and will carry off their 
wives. We hail the omen; we mean the women and riches of the enemy to be our 
spoil." About midday there was a skirmishing attack on our camp, without any 
discharge of missiles, when they saw the cohorts in close array before the 
lines and no sign of carelessness.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>The same night brought with it a cheering dream to <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. He saw 
himself engaged in sacrifice, and his robe being sprinkled with the sacred 
blood, another more beautiful was given him by the hands of his grandmother 
<name type="person">Augusta</name>. Encouraged by the omen and finding the auspices favourable, he 
called an assembly, and explained the precautions which wisdom suggested as 
suitable for the impending battle. "It is not," he said, "plains only which 
are good for the fighting of Roman soldiers, but woods and forest passes, if 
science be used. For the huge shields and unwieldly lances of the barbarians 
cannot, amid trunks of trees and brushwood that springs from the ground, be 
so

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">HARANGUES OF GERMANICUS AND ARMINIUS</note>
well managed 
as our javelins and swords and close-fitting armour. Shower your blows 
thickly; strike at the face with your swords' points. The <name type="ethnic">German</name> has neither 
cuirass nor helmet; even his shield is not strengthened with leather or 
steel, but is of osiers woven together or of thin and painted board. If 
their first line is armed with spears, the rest have only weapons hardened 
by fire or very short. Again, though their frames are terrible to the eye 
and formidable in a brief onset, they have no capacity of enduring wounds; 
without any shame at the disgrace, without any regard to their leaders, they 
quit the field and flee; they quail under disaster, just as in success they 
forget alike divine and human laws. If in your weariness of land and sea you 
desire an end of service, this battle prepares the way to it. The <rs type="placename">Elbe</rs> is now nearer than the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, and there is no war beyond, provided only you 
enable me, keeping close as I do to my father's and my uncle's footsteps, to 
stand a conqueror on the same spot."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>The general's speech was followed by enthusiasm in the soldiers, and the 
signal for battle was given. Nor were <name type="person">Arminius</name> and the other German chiefs 
slow to call their respective clansmen to witness that "these <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> were 
the most cowardly fugitives out of <name type="person">Varus</name>'s army, men who rather than endure 
war had taken to mutiny. Half of them have their backs covered with wounds; 
half are once again exposing limbs battered by waves and storms to a foe 
full of fury, and to hostile deities, with no hope of advantage. They have, 
in fact, had recourse to a fleet and to a trackless ocean, that their coming 
might be unopposed, their flight unpursued. But when once they have joined 
conflict with us, the help of winds or oars will be unavailing to the 
vanquished. Remember only their greed, their cruelty, their pride. Is 
anything left for us but to retain our freedom or to die before we are 
enslaved?"</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>When they were thus roused 
and were demanding battle, their chiefs led them down into a plain named 
<rs type="placename">Idistavisus</rs>. It winds between the <rs type="placename">Visurgis</rs> and a 
hill range, its breadth varying as the river banks recede or the spurs of 
the hills project on it. In their rear rose a forest, with the branches 
rising to a great height, while there were clear

spaces between 
the trunks. The barbarian army occupied the plain and the outskirts of the 
wood. The <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name> were posted by themselves on the high ground, so as to 
rush down on the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> during the battle.</p>
<p>Our army advanced in the 
following order. The auxiliary <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> and <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> were in the van, then the 
foot-archers, after them, four legions and <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> himself with two 
pr&aelig;torian cohorts and some picked cavalry. Next came as many other 
legions, and light-armed troops with horse-bowmen, and the remaining cohorts 
of the allies. The men were quite ready and prepared to form in line of 
battle according to their marching order.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p><name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, as soon as he saw the Cheruscan bands which in 
their impetuous spirit had rushed to the attack, ordered the finest of his 
cavalry to charge them in flank, <name type="person">Stertinius</name> with the other squadrons to make 
a d&eacute;tour and fall on their rear, promising himself to come up in good 
time. Meanwhile there was a most encouraging augury. Eight eagles, seen to 
fly towards the woods and to enter them, caught the general's eye. "Go," he 
exclaimed, "follow the Roman birds, the true deities of our legions." At the 
same moment the infantry charged, and the cavalry which had been sent on in 
advance dashed on the rear and the flanks. And, strange to relate, two 
columns of the enemy fled in opposite directions, that, which had occupied 
the wood, rushing into the open, those who had been drawn up on the plains, 
into the wood. The <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, who were between them, were dislodged from the 
hills, while <name type="person">Arminius</name>, conspicuous among them by gesture, voice, and a wound 
he had received, kept up the fight. He had thrown himself on our archers and 
was on the point of breaking through them, when the cohorts of the <name type="ethnic">Raeti</name>, 
<name type="ethnic">Vendelici</name>, and <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> faced his attack. By a strong bodily effort, however, 
and a furious rush of his horse, he made his way through them, having 
smeared his face with his blood, that he might not be known. Some have said 
that he was recognised by <name type="ethnic">Chauci</name> serving among the Roman auxiliaries, who 
let him go. </p>
<p><name type="person">Inguiomerus</name> owed his escape to similar courage or treachery. 
The rest were cut down in every direction. Many in attempting to swim across 
the <rs type="placename">Visurgis</rs> were overwhelmed

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GERMANS DEFEATED, BUT REFORM LINES</note>
under a storm of 
missiles or by the force of the current, lastly, by the rush of fugitives 
and the falling in of the banks. Some in their ignominious flight climbed 
the tops of trees, and as they were hiding themselves in the boughs, archers 
were brought up and they were shot for sport. Others were dashed to the 
ground by the felling of the trees.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>It was a great victory and without bloodshed to us. From nine in the morning 
to nightfall the enemy were slaughtered, and ten miles were covered with 
arms and dead bodies, while there were found amid the plunder the chains 
which the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> had brought with them for the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, as though the issue 
were certain. The soldiers on the battle field hailed <name type="person">Tiberius</name> as Imperator, 
and raised a mound on which arms were piled in the style of a trophy, with 
the names of the conquered tribes inscribed beneath them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>That sight caused keener grief and rage among the 
<name type="ethnic">Germans</name> than their wounds, their mourning, and their losses. Those who but 
now were preparing to quit their settlements and to retreat to the further 
side of the <rs type="placename">Elbe</rs>, longed for battle and flew to 
arms. Common people and chiefs, young and old, rushed on the Roman army, and 
spread disorder. At last they chose a spot closed in by a river and by 
forests, within which was a narrow swampy plain. The woods too were 
surrounded by a bottomless morass, only on one side of it the <name type="ethnic">Angrivarii</name> had 
raised a broad earthwork, as a boundary between themselves and the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>. 
Here their infantry was ranged. Their cavalry they concealed in neighbouring 
woods, so as to be on the legions' rear, as soon as they entered the 
forest.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>All this was known to 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>. He was acquainted with their plans, their positions, with what 
met the eye, and what was hidden, and he prepared to turn the enemy's 
stratagems to their own destruction. To <name type="person">Seius Tubero</name>, his chief officer, he 
assigned the cavalry and the plain. His infantry he drew up so that part 
might advance on level ground into the forest, and part clamber up the 
earthwork which confronted them. He charged himself with what was the 
specially difficult operation, leaving the rest to his officers. Those who 
had the level ground easily forced a passage. Those who had to assault the 
earthwork encountered heavy blows from above

as if they were 
scaling a wall. The general saw how unequal this close fighting was, and 
having withdrawn his legions to a little distance, ordered the slingers and 
artillerymen to discharge a volley of missiles and scatter the enemy. Spears 
were hurled from the engines, and the more conspicuous were the defenders of 
the position, the more the wounds with which they were driven from it. 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> with some pr&aelig;torian cohorts was the first, after the 
storming of the ramparts, to dash into the woods. There they fought at close 
quarters. A morass was in the enemy's rear, and the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> were hemmed in by 
the river or by the hills. Both were in a desperate plight from their 
position; valour was their only hope, victory their only safety.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>The Germans were equally brave, but they 
were beaten by the nature of the fighting and of the weapons, for their vast 
host in so confined a space could neither thrust out nor recover their 
immense lances, or avail themselves of their nimble movements and lithe 
frames, forced as they were to a close engagement. Our soldiers, on the 
other hand, with their shields pressed to their breasts, and their hands 
grasping their sword-hilts, struck at the huge limbs and exposed faces of 
the barbarians, cutting a passage through the slaughtered enemy, for 
<name type="person">Arminius</name> was now less active, either from incessant perils, or because he 
was partially disabled by his recent wound. As for <name type="person">Inguiomerus</name>, who flew 
hither and thither over the battle-field, it was fortune rather than courage 
which forsook him. <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, too, that he might be the better known, took 
his helmet off his head and begged his men to follow up the slaughter, as 
they wanted not prisoners, and the utter destruction of the nation would be 
the only conclusion of the war. And now, late in the day, he withdrew one of 
his legions from the field, to intrench a camp, while the rest till 
nightfall glutted themselves with the enemy's blood. Our cavalry fought with 
indecisive success.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>Having publicly 
praised his victorious troops, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> raised a pile of arms with the 
proud inscription, "The army of <name type="person">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</name>, after thoroughly 
conquering the tribes between the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> and the <rs type="placename">Elbe</rs>, has dedicated this monument to <name type="person">Mars</name>, <name type="person">Jupiter</name>, and 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>." He added nothing about himself, fearing jealousy, or thinking 
that the con-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">ROMAN VICTORY; LEGIONARIES 
SHIPWRECKED</note>
ciousness of the achievement was enough. Next he charged 
<name type="person">Stertinius</name> with making war on the <name type="ethnic">Angrivarii</name>, but they hastened to 
surrender. And, as suppliants, by refusing nothing, they obtained a full 
pardon.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>When, however, summer was at 
its height, some of the legions were sent back overland into 
winter-quarters, but most of them <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> put on board the fleet and 
brought down the river <rs type="placename">Amisia</rs> to the ocean. At first 
the calm waters merely sounded with the oars of a thousand vessels or were 
ruffled by the sailing ships. Soon, a hailstorm bursting from a black mass 
of clouds, while the waves rolled hither and thither under tempestuous gales 
from every quarter, rendered clear sight impossible, and the steering 
difficult, while our soldiers, terrorstricken and without any experience of 
disasters on the sea, by embarrassing the sailors or giving them clumsy aid, 
neutralized the services of the skilled crews. After a while, wind and wave 
shifted wholly to the south, and from the hilly lands and deep rivers of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> came, with a huge line of rolling clouds, a 
strong blast, all the more frightful from the frozen north which was so near 
to them, and instantly caught and drove the ships hither and thither into 
the open ocean, or on islands with steep cliffs or which hidden shoals made 
perilous. These they just escaped, with difficulty, and when the tide 
changed and bore them the same way as the wind, they could not hold to their 
anchors or bale out the water which rushed in upon them. Horses, beasts of 
burden, baggage, were thrown overboard, in order to lighten the hulls which 
leaked copiously through their sides, while the waves too dashed over 
them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>As the ocean is stormier than 
all other seas, and as <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> is conspicuous for 
the terrors of its climate, so in novelty and extent did this disaster 
transcend every other, for all around were hostile coasts, or an expanse so 
vast and deep that it is thought to be the remotest shoreless sea. Some of 
the vessels were swallowed up; many were wrecked on distant islands, and the 
soldiers, finding there no form of human life, perished of hunger, except 
some who supported existence on carcases of horses washed on the same 
shores. <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s trireme alone reached the country of the <name type="ethnic">Chauci</name>. Day 
and night; on those rocks and promontories he

would incessantly 
exclaim that he was himself responsible for this awful ruin, and friends 
scarce restrained him from seeking death in the same sea. </p>
<p>At last, as 
the tide ebbed and the wind blew favourably, the shattered vessels with but 
few rowers, or clothing spread as sails, some towed by the more powerful, 
returned, and <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, having speedily repaired them, sent them to search 
the islands. Many by that means were recovered. The <name type="ethnic">Angrivarii</name>, who had 
lately been admitted to our alliance, restored to us several whom they had 
ransomed from the inland tribes. Some had been carried to <rs type="placename">Britain</rs> and were 
sent back by the petty chiefs. Every one, as he returned from some 
far-distant region, told of wonders, of violent hurricanes, and unknown 
birds, of monsters of the sea, of forms half-human, half beast-like, things 
they had really seen or in their terror believed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>Meanwhile the rumoured loss of the fleet stirred the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> to 
hope for war, as it did <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> to hold them down. He ordered <name type="person">Caius 
Silius</name> with thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry to march 
against the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>. He himself, with a larger army, invaded the <name type="ethnic">Marsi</name>, whose 
leader, <name type="person">Mallovendus</name>, whom we had lately admitted to surrender, pointed out a 
neighbouring wood, where, he said, an eagle of one of <name type="person">Varus</name>'s legions was 
buried and guarded only by a small force. Immediately troops were despatched 
to draw the enemy from his position by appearing in his front, others, to 
hem in his rear and open the ground. Fortune favoured both. So <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, 
with increased energy, advanced into the country, laying it waste, and 
utterly ruining a foe who dared not encounter him, or who was instantly 
defeated wherever he resisted, and, as we learnt from prisoners, was never 
more panic-stricken. The <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, they declared, were invincible, rising 
superior to all calamities; for having thrown away a fleet, having lost 
their arms, after strewing the shores with the carcases of horses and of 
men, they had rushed to the attack with the same courage, with equal spirit, 
and, seemingly, with augmented numbers.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>The soldiers were then led back into winter-quarters, rejoicing 
in their hearts at having been compensated for their disasters at sea by a 
successful expedition. They were helped

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GERMANICUS RECALLED 
DESPITE SUCCESS</note>
too by <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s bounty, which made good whatever 
loss any one declared he had suffered. It was also regarded as a certainty 
that the enemy were wavering and consulting on negotiations for peace, and 
that, with an additional campaign next summer the war might be ended. 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, however, in repeated letters advised <name type="person">Germanicus</name> to return for the 
triumph decreed him. "He had now had enough of success, enough of disaster. 
He had fought victorious battles on a great scale; he should also remember 
those losses which the winds and waves had inflicted, and which, though due 
to no fault of the general, were still grievous and shocking. He, <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
had himself been sent nine times by <name type="person">Augustus</name> into <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, and had done more by policy than by arms. By 
this means the submission of the <name type="ethnic">Sugambri</name> had been secured, and the <name type="ethnic">Suevi</name> 
with their king <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> had been forced into peace. The <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name> too and 
the other insurgent tribes, since the vengeance of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> had been satisfied, might be left to their internal 
feuds." </p>
<p>When <name type="person">Germanicus</name> requested a year for the completion of his 
enterprise, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> put a severer pressure on his modesty by offering him a 
second consulship, the functions of which he was to discharge in person. He 
also added that if war must still be waged, he might as well leave some 
materials for renown to his brother <name type="person">Drusus</name>, who, as there was then no other 
enemy, could win only in <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> the imperial title 
and the triumphal laurel. <name type="person">Germanicus</name> hesitated no longer, though he saw that 
this was a pretence, and that he was hurried away through jealousy from the 
glory he had already acquired.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>About 
the same time <name type="person">Libo Drusus</name>, of the family of Scribonii, was accused of 
revolutionary schemes. I will explain, somewhat minutely, the beginning, 
progress, and end of this affair, since then first were originated those 
practices which for so many years have eaten into the heart of the State. 
<name type="person">Firmius Catus</name>, a senator, an intimate friend of <name type="person">Libo</name>'s, prompted the young 
man, who was thoughtless and an easy prey to delusions, to resort to 
astrologers' promises, magical rites, and interpreters of dreams, dwelling 
ostentatiously on his great-grandfather <name type="person">Pompeius</name>, his aunt <name type="person">Scribonia</name>, who 
had formerly been wife of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, his imperial cousins, his

house crowded with ancestral busts, and urging him to extravagance and 
debt, himself the companion of his profligacy and desperate embarrassments, 
thereby to entangle him in all the more proofs of guilt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>As soon as he found enough witnesses, with some 
slaves who knew the facts, he begged an audience of the emperor, after first 
indicating the crime and the criminal through <name type="person">Flaccus Vescularius</name>, a Roman 
knight, who was more intimate with <name type="person">Tiberius</name> than himself. <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, 
without disregarding the information, declined an interview, for the 
communication, he said, might be conveyed to him through the same messenger, 
<name type="person">Flaccus</name>. Meanwhile he conferred the pr&aelig;torship on <name type="person">Libo</name> and often 
invited him to his table, showing no unfriendliness in his looks or anger in 
his words (so thoroughly had he concealed his resentment); and he wished to 
know all his saying and doings, though it was in his power to stop them, 
till one <name type="person">Junius</name>, who had been tampered with by <name type="person">Libo</name> for the purpose of 
evoking by incantations spirits of the dead, gave information to <name type="person">Fulcinius 
Trio</name>. <name type="person">Trio</name>'s ability was conspicuous among informers, as well as his 
eagerness for an evil notoriety. He at once pounced on the accused, went to 
the consuls, and demanded an inquiry before the Senate. The Senators were 
summoned, with a special notice that they must consult on a momentous and 
terrible matter.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p><name type="person">Libo</name> meanwhile, in 
mourning apparel and accompanied by ladies of the highest rank, went to 
house after house, entreating his relatives, and imploring some eloquent 
voice to ward off his perils; which all refused, on different pretexts, but 
from the same apprehension. On the day the Senate met, jaded with fear and 
mental anguish, or, as some have related, feigning illness, he was carried 
in a litter to the doors of the <rs type="placename">Senate House</rs>, and leaning on his brother he 
raised his hands and voice in supplication to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, who received him 
with unmoved countenance. The emperor then read out the charges and the 
accusers' names, with such calmness as not to seem to soften or aggravate 
the accusations.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>Besides <name type="person">Trio</name> and 
<name type="person">Catus</name>, <name type="person">Fonteius Agrippa</name> and <name type="person">Caius Vibius</name> were among his accusers, and 
claimed with eager rivalry the privilege of conducting the case for the 
prosecu-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROSECUTION AND SUICIDE OF LIBO</note>
tion, till 
<name type="person">Vibius</name>, as they would not yield one to the other, and <name type="person">Libo</name> had entered 
without counsel, offered to state the charges against him singly, and 
produced an extravagantly absurd accusation, according to which <name type="person">Libo</name> had 
consulted persons whether he would have such wealth as to be able to cover 
the <rs type="placename">Appian road</rs> as far as <rs type="placename">Brundisium</rs> with money. There were other questions 
of the same sort, quite senseless and idle; if leniently regarded, pitiable. 
But there was one paper in <name type="person">Libo</name>'s handwriting, so the prosecutor alleged, 
with the names of C&aelig;sars and of Senators, to which marks were affixed 
of dreadful or mysterious significance. When the accused denied this, it was 
decided that his slaves who recognised the writing should be examined by 
torture. As an ancient statute of the Senate forbade such inquiry in a case 
affecting a master's life, <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, with his cleverness in devising new 
law, ordered <name type="person">Libo</name>'s slaves to be sold singly to the State-agent, so that, 
forsooth, without an infringement of the Senate's decree, <name type="person">Libo</name> might be 
tried on their evidence. As a consequence, the defendant asked an 
adjournment till next day, and having gone home he charged his kinsman, 
<name type="person">Publius Quirinus</name>, with his last prayer to the emperor.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>The answer was that he should address himself to 
the Senate. Meanwhile his house was surrounded with soldiers; they crowded 
noisily even about the entrance, so that they could be heard and seen, when 
<name type="person">Libo</name>, whose anguish drove him from the very banquet he had prepared as his 
last gratification, called for a minister of death, grasped the hands of his 
slaves, and thrust a sword into them. In their confusion, as they shrank 
back, they overturned the lamp on the table at his side, and in the 
darkness, now to him the gloom of death, he aimed two blows at a vital part. 
At the groans of the falling man his freedmen hurried up, and the soldiers, 
seeing the bloody deed, stood aloof. Yet the prosecution was continued in 
the Senate with the same persistency, and <name type="person">Tiberius</name> declared on oath that he 
would have interceded for his life, guilty though he was, but for his hasty 
suicide.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>His property was divided 
among his accusers, and pr&aelig;torships out of the usual order were 
conferred on those who were of senators' rank. <name type="person">Cotta Messalinus</name> then 
proposed that <name type="person">Libo</name>'s bust should not be carried in the funeral proces-

sion of any of his descendants; and <name type="person">Cneius Lentulus</name>, that no 
<name type="person">Scribonius</name> should assume the surname of Drusus. Days of public thanksgiving 
were appointed on the suggestion of <name type="person">Pomponius Flaccus</name>. Offerings were given 
to <name type="person">Jupiter</name>, <name type="person">Mars</name>, and <name type="person">Concord</name>, and the 13th day of September, on which <name type="person">Libo</name> 
had killed himself, was to be observed as a festival, on the motion of 
<name type="person">Gallus Asinius</name>, <name type="person">Papius Mutilus</name>, and <name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>. I have mentioned the 
proposals and sycophancy of these men, in order to bring to light this 
old-standing evil in the State. </p>
<p>Decrees of the Senate were also passed 
to expel from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> astrologers and magicians. One 
of their number, <name type="person">Lucius Pituanius</name>, was hurled from the <rs type="placename">Rock</rs>. Another, 
<name type="person">Publius Marcius</name>, was executed, according to ancient custom, by the consuls 
outside the <rs type="placename">Esquiline Gate</rs>, after the trumpets had been bidden to 
sound.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>On the next day of the Senate's 
meeting much was said against the luxury of the country by <name type="person">Quintus Haterius</name>, 
an ex-consul, and by <name type="person">Octavius Fronto</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor. It was decided 
that vessels of solid gold should not be made for the serving of food, and 
that men should not disgrace themselves with silken clothing from the East. 
<name type="person">Fronto</name> went further, and insisted on restrictions being put on plate, 
furniture, and household establishments. It was indeed still usual with the 
Senators, when it was their turn to vote, to suggest anything they thought 
for the State's advantage. <name type="person">Gallus Asinius</name> argued on the other side. "With 
the growth of the empire private wealth too," he said, "had increased, and 
there was nothing new in this, but it accorded with the fashions of the 
earliest antiquity. Riches were one thing with the Fabricii, quite another 
with the Scipios. The State was the standard of everything; when it was 
poor, the homes of the citizens were humble; when it reached such 
magnificence, private grandeur increased. In household establishments, and 
plate, and in whatever was provided for use, there was neither excess nor 
parsimony except in relation to the fortune of the possessor. A distinction 
had been made in the assessments of Senators and knights, not because they 
differed naturally, but that the superiority of the one class in places in 
the theatre, in rank and in honour, might be also maintained in

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">OPINIONS ON SUMPTUARY REGULATIONS</note>
everything else which 
insured mental repose and bodily recreation, unless indeed men in the 
highest position were to undergo more anxieties and more dangers, and to be 
at the same time deprived of all solace under those anxieties and dangers." 
<name type="person">Gallus</name> gained a ready assent, under these specious phrases, by a confession 
of failings with which his audience sympathised. And <name type="person">Tiberius</name> too had added 
that this was not a time for censorship, and that if there were any 
declension in manners, a promoter of reform would not be 
wanting.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>During this debate <name type="person">Lucius 
Piso</name>, after exclaiming against the corruption of the courts, the bribery of 
judges, the cruel threats of accusations from hired orators, declared that 
he would depart and quit the capital, and that he meant to live in some 
obscure and distant rural retreat. At the same moment he rose to leave the 
<rs type="placename">Senate House</rs>. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> was much excited, and though he pacified <name type="person">Piso</name> with 
gentle words, he also strongly urged his relatives to stop his departure by 
their influence or their entreaties. </p><p>Soon afterwards this same <name type="person">Piso</name> gave 
an equal proof of a fearless sense of wrong by suing <name type="person">Urgulania</name>, whom 
<name type="person">Augusta</name>'s friendship had raised above the law. Neither did <name type="person">Urgulania</name> obey 
the summons, for in defiance of <name type="person">Piso</name> she went in her litter to the emperor's 
house; nor did <name type="person">Piso</name> give way, though <name type="person">Augusta</name> complained that she was 
insulted and her majesty slighted. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, thinking to win popularity by 
so far humouring his mother as to say that he would go to the pr&aelig;tor's 
court and support <name type="person">Urgulania</name>, went forth from the palace, having ordered 
soldiers to follow him at a distance. He was seen, as the people thronged 
about him, to wear a calm face, while he prolonged his time on the way with 
various conversations, till at last when <name type="person">Piso</name>'s relatives tried in vain to 
restrain him, <name type="person">Augusta</name> directed the money which was claimed to be handed to 
him. This ended the affair, and <name type="person">Piso</name>, in consequence, was not dishonoured, 
and the emperor rose in reputation. <name type="person">Urgulania</name>'s influence, however, was so 
formidable to the State, that in a certain cause which was tried by the 
Senate she would not condescend to appear as a witness. The pr&aelig;tor was 
sent to question her at her own house, although the <placeName key="tgn,2744463">Vestal</placeName> virgins, 
according to ancient custom,

were heard in the courts, before 
judges, whenever they gave evidence.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>I 
should say nothing of the adjournment of public business in this year, if it 
were not worth while to notice the conflicting opinions of <name type="person">Cneius Piso</name> and 
<name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name> on the subject. <name type="person">Piso</name>, although the emperor had said that he 
would be absent, held that all the more ought the business to be transacted, 
that the State might have the honour of its Senate and knights being able to 
perform their duties in the sovereign's absence. <name type="person">Gallus</name>, as <name type="person">Piso</name> had 
forestalled him in the display of freedom, maintained that nothing was 
sufficiently impressive or suitable to the majesty of the Roman people, 
unless done before <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> and under his very eyes, and that therefore 
the gathering from all <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> and the influx from the 
provinces ought to be reserved for his presence. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> listened to this 
in silence, and the matter was debated on both sides in a sharp controversy. 
The business, however, was adjourned.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>A dispute then arose between <name type="person">Gallus</name> and the emperor. <name type="person">Gallus</name> proposed that 
the elections of magistrates should be held every five years, and that the 
commanders of the legions who before receiving a pr&aelig;torship discharged 
this military service should at once become pr&aelig;tors-elect, the emperor 
nominating twelve candidates every year. It was quite evident that this 
motion had a deeper meaning and was an attempt to explore the secrets of 
imperial policy. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, however, argued as if his power would be thus 
increased. "It would," he said, "be trying to his moderation to have to 
elect so many and to put off so many. He scarcely avoided giving offence 
from year to year, even though a candidate's rejection was solaced by the 
near prospect of office. What hatred would be incurred from those whose 
election was deferred for five years! How could he foresee through so long 
an interval what would be a man's temper, or domestic relations, or estate? 
Men became arrogant even with this annual appointment. What would happen if 
their thoughts were fixed on promotion for five years? It was in fact a 
multiplying of the magistrates five-fold, and a subversion of the laws which 
had prescribed proper periods for the exercise of the candidate's activity 
and the seeking or securing office." With

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IMPERIAL CONTROL 
OF HONORS</note>
this seemingly conciliatory speech he retained the 
substance of power.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>He also increased 
the incomes of some of the Senators. Hence it was the more surprising that 
he listened somewhat disdainfully to the request of <name type="person">Marcus Hortalus</name>, a youth 
of noble rank in conspicuous poverty. He was the grandson of the orator 
<name type="person">Hortensius</name>, and had been induced by <name type="person">Augustus</name>, on the strength of a gift of a 
million sesterces, to marry and rear children, that one of our most 
illustrious families might not become extinct. Accordingly, with his four 
sons standing at the doors of the <rs type="placename">Senate House</rs>, the Senate then sitting in 
the palace, when it was his turn to speak he began to address them as 
follows, his eyes fixed now on the statue of <name type="person">Hortensius</name> which stood among 
those of the orators, now on that of <name type="person">Augustus</name>: "Senators, these whose 
numbers and boyish years you behold I have reared, not by my own choice, but 
because the emperor advised me. At the same time, my ancestors deserved to 
have descendants. For myself, not having been able in these altered times to 
receive or acquire wealth or popular favour, or that eloquence which has 
been the hereditary possession of our house, I was satisfied if my narrow 
means were neither a disgrace to myself nor a burden to others. At the 
emperor's bidding I married. Behold the offspring and progeny of a 
succession of consuls and dictators. Not to excite odium do I recall such 
facts, but to win compassion. While you prosper, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, they will 
attain such promotion as you shall bestow. Meanwhile save from penury the 
great-grandsons of <name type="person">Quintus Hortensius</name>, the foster-children of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>The Senate's favourable 
bias was an incitement to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> to offer prompt opposition, which he did 
in nearly these words:&mdash;"If all poor men begin to come here and to beg 
money for their children, individuals will never be satisfied, and the State 
will be bankrupt. Certainly our ancestors did not grant the privilege of 
occasionally proposing amendments or of suggesting, in our turn for 
speaking, something for the general advantage in order that we might in this 
house increase our private business and property, thereby bringing odium on 
the Senate and on emperors whether they concede or refuse their bounty. In 
fact, it is not

a request, but an importunity, as utterly 
unreasonable as it is unforeseen, for a senator, when the house has met on 
other matters, to rise from his place and, pleading the number and age of 
his children, put a pressure on the delicacy of the Senate, then transfer 
the same constraint to myself, and, as it were, break open the exchequer, 
which, if we exhaust it by improper favouritism, will have to be replenished 
by crimes. Money was given you, <name type="person">Hortalus</name>, by <name type="person">Augustus</name>, but without 
solicitation, and not on the condition of its being always given. Otherwise 
industry will languish and idleness be encouraged, if a man has nothing to 
fear, nothing to hope from himself, and every one, in utter recklessness, 
will expect relief from others, thus becoming useless to himself and a 
burden to me." </p>
<p>These and like remarks, though listened to with assent by 
those who make it a practice to eulogise everything coming from sovereigns, 
both good and bad, were received by the majority in silence or with 
suppressed murmurs. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> perceived it, and having paused a while, said 
that he had given <name type="person">Hortalus</name> his answer, but that if the senators thought it 
right, he would bestow two hundred thousand sesterces on each of his 
children of the male sex. The others thanked him; <name type="person">Hortalus</name> said nothing, 
either from alarm or because even in his reduced fortunes he clung to his 
hereditary nobility. Nor did <name type="person">Tiberius</name> afterwards show any pity, though the 
house of <name type="person">Hortensius</name> sank into shameful poverty.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>That same year the daring of a single slave, had it not been 
promptly checked, would have ruined the State by discord and civil war. A 
servant of <name type="person">Postumus Agrippa</name>, <name type="person">Clemens</name> by name, having ascertained that 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> was dead, formed a design beyond a slave's conception, of going to 
the island of <rs type="placename">Planasia</rs> and seizing <name type="person">Agrippa</name> by craft 
or force and bringing him to the armies of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>. 
The slowness of a merchant vessel thwarted his bold venture. Meanwhile the 
murder of <name type="person">Agrippa</name> had been perpetrated, and then turning his thoughts to a 
greater and more hazardous enterprise, he stole the ashes of the deceased, 
sailed to <rs type="placename">Cosa</rs>, a promontory of <rs type="placename">Etruria</rs>, and there hid himself in obscure places till 
his hair and beard were long. In age and figure he was not unlike his 
master. Then through suitable emis-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FRAUDULENT PRETENDER

saries who shared his secret, it was rumoured that <name type="person">Agrippa</name> 
was alive, first in whispered gossip, soon, as is usual with forbidden 
topics, in vague talk which found its way to the credulous ears of the most 
ignorant people or of restless and revolutionary schemers. He himself went 
to the towns, as the day grew dark, without letting himself be seen publicly 
or remaining long in the same places, but, as he knew that truth gains 
strength by notoriety and time, falsehood by precipitancy and vagueness, he 
would either withdraw himself from publicity or else forestall 
it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>It was rumoured meanwhile 
throughout <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, and was believed at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, that <name type="person">Agrippa</name> had been saved by the blessing of 
<rs type="placename">Heaven</rs>. Already at <rs type="placename">Ostia</rs>, where he had arrived, he 
was the centre of interest to a vast concourse as well as to secret 
gatherings in the capital, while <name type="person">Tiberius</name> was distracted by the doubt 
whether he should crush this slave of his by military force or allow time to 
dissipate a silly credulity. Sometimes he thought that he must overlook 
nothing, sometimes that he need not be afraid of everything, his mind 
fluctuating between shame and terror. At last he entrusted the affair to 
<name type="person">Sallustius Crispus</name>, who chose two of his dependants (some say they were 
soldiers) and urged them to go to him as pretended accomplices, offering 
money and promising faithful companionship in danger. They did as they were 
bidden; then, waiting for an unguarded hour of night, they took with them a 
sufficient force, and having bound and gagged him, dragged him to the 
palace. When <name type="person">Tiberius</name> asked him how he had become <name type="person">Agrippa</name>, he is said to 
have replied, "As you became <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>." He could not be forced to divulge 
his accomplices. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> did not venture on a public execution, but ordered 
him to be slain in a private part of the palace and his body to be secretly 
removed. And although many of the emperor's household and knights and 
senators were said to have supported him with their wealth and helped him 
with their counsels, no inquiry was made.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>At the close of the year was consecrated an arch near the temple 
of <name type="person">Saturn</name> to commemorate the recovery of the standards lost with <name type="person">Varus</name>, 
under the leadership of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and the auspices of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>; a temple of 
<name type="person">Fors Fortuna</name>,

by the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, in the gardens 
which <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, the dictator, bequeathed to the Roman people; a chapel to

<p>In the consulship of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;cilius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Pomponius</name>, 
<name type="person">Germanicus C&aelig;sar</name>, on the 26th day of May, celebrated his triumph over 
the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>, and <name type="ethnic">Angrivarii</name>, and the other tribes which extend as 
far as the <rs type="placename">Elbe</rs>. There were borne in procession 
spoils, prisoners, representations of the mountains, the rivers and battles; 
and the war, seeing that he had been forbidden to finish it, was taken as 
finished. The admiration of the beholders was heightened by the striking 
comeliness of the general and the chariot which bore his five children. 
Still, there was a latent dread when they remembered how unfortunate in the 
case of <name type="person">Drusus</name>, his father, had been the favour of the crowd; how his uncle 
<name type="person">Marcellus</name>, regarded by the city populace with passionate enthusiasm, had 
been snatched from them while yet a youth, and how short-lived and 
ill-starred were the attachments of the Roman people.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> meanwhile in the name of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> gave 
every one of the city populace three hundred sesterces, and nominated 
himself his colleague in the consulship. Still, failing to obtain credit for 
sincere affection, he resolved to get the young prince out of the way, under 
pretence of conferring distinction, and for this he invented reasons, or 
eagerly fastened on such as chance presented. </p>
<p>King <name type="person">Archelaus</name> had been in 
possession of <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs> for fifty years, and 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> hated him because he had not shown him any mark of respect while he 
was at <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs>. This neglect of <name type="person">Archelaus</name> was not due 
to pride, but was suggested by the intimate friends of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, because, 
when <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> was in his prime and had charge of the affairs of the 
East, <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s friendship was thought to be dangerous. When, after the 
extinction of the family of the C&aelig;sars, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> acquired the empire, 
he enticed <name type="person">Archelaus</name> by a letter from his mother, who without concealing her 
son's displeasure promised mercy if he would come to beg for it. <name type="person">Archelaus</name>, 
either quite unsuspicious of treachery, or dreading compulsion, should it be 
thought that he saw through it, hastened to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. 
There he was received by a pitiless

emperor, and soon afterwards was arraigned before 
the Senate. In his anguish and in the weariness of old age, and from being 
unused, as a king, to equality, much less to degradation, not, certainly, 
from fear of the charges fabricated against him, he ended his life, by his 
own act or by a natural death. His kingdom was reduced into a province, and 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> declared that, with its revenues, the one per cent. tax could be 
lightened, which, for the future, he fixed at one-half per cent. </p>
<p>During 
the same time, on the deaths of <name type="person">Antiochus</name> and <name type="person">Philopator</name>, kings respectively 
of the <name type="ethnic">Commageni</name> and <name type="ethnic">Cilicians</name>, these nations became excited, a majority 
desiring the Roman rule, some, that of their kings. The provinces too of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> and <rs type="placename">Jud&aelig;a</rs>, exhausted 
by their burdens, implored a reduction of tribute.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> accordingly discussed these matters and the affairs of 
<rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, which I have already related, before the 
Senate. "The commotions in the East," he said, "could be quieted only by the 
wisdom of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>; his own life was on the decline, and <name type="person">Drusus</name> had not 
yet reached his maturity." Thereupon, by a decree of the Senate, the 
provinces beyond sea were entrusted to <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, with greater powers 
wherever he went than were given to those who obtained their provinces by 
lot or by the emperor's appointment. </p>
<p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> had however removed from 
<rs type="placename">Syria</rs> <name type="person">Creticus Silanus</name>, who was connected by a close 
tie with <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, his daughter being betrothed to <name type="person">Nero</name>, the eldest of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s children. He appointed to it <name type="person">Cneius Piso</name>, a man of violent 
temper, without an idea of obedience, with indeed a natural arrogance 
inherited from his father <name type="person">Piso</name>, who in the civil war supported with the most 
energetic aid against <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> the reviving faction in <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, then embraced the cause of <name type="person">Brutus</name> and <name type="person">Cassius</name>, 
and, when suffered to return, refrained from seeking promotion till he was 
actually solicited to accept a consulship offered by <name type="person">Augustus</name>. But beside 
the father's haughty temper there was also the noble rank and wealth of his 
wife <name type="person">Plancina</name>, to inflame his ambition. He would hardly be the inferior of 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and as for <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s children, he looked down on them as far 
beneath him. He thought it a certainty that he had been chosen to

govern <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> in order to thwart the 
aspirations of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. Some believed that he had even received secret 
instructions from <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and it was beyond a question that <name type="person">Augusta</name>, with 
feminine jealousy, had suggested to <name type="person">Plancina</name> calumnious insinuations against 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>. For there was division and discord in the court, with unexpressed 
partialities towards either <name type="person">Drusus</name> or <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> favoured <name type="person">Drusus</name>, 
as his own son and born of his own blood. As for <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, his uncle's 
estrangement had increased the affection which all others felt for him, and 
there was the fact too that he had an advantage in the illustrious rank of 
his mother's family, among whom he could point to his grandfather <name type="person">Marcus 
Antonius</name> and to his great-uncle <name type="person">Augustus</name>. <name type="person">Drusus</name>, on the other hand, had for 
his great-grandfather a Roman knight, <name type="person">Pomponius Atticus</name>, who seemed to 
disgrace the ancestral images of the Claudii. Again, the consort of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, in number of children and in character, was superior 
to <name type="person">Livia</name>, the wife of <name type="person">Drusus</name>. Yet the brothers were singularly united, and 
were wholly unaffected by the rivalries of their kinsfolk.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>Soon afterwards <name type="person">Drusus</name> was sent into <rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs> to be familiarised with military service, and 
to win the goodwill of the army. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> also thought that it was better 
for the young prince, who was being demoralised by the luxury of the 
capital, to serve in a camp, while he felt himself the safer with both his 
sons in command of legions. However, he made a pretext of the <name type="ethnic">Suevi</name>, who 
were imploring help against the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>. For when the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had departed 
and they were free from the fear of an invader, these tribes, according to 
the custom of the race, and then specially as rivals in fame, had turned 
their arms against each other. The strength of the two nations, the valour 
of their chiefs were equal. But the title of king rendered <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> hated 
among his countrymen, while <name type="person">Arminius</name> was regarded with favour, as the 
champion of freedom.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>Thus it was not 
only the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name> and their allies, the old soldiers of <name type="person">Arminius</name>, who took 
up arms, but even the <name type="ethnic">Semnones</name> and <name type="ethnic">Langobardi</name> from the kingdom of <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> 
revolted to that chief. With this addition he must have had an overwhelming 
superiority, had not <name type="person">Inguiomerus</name> deserted

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">ARMINIUS AND 
MAROBODUUS AGITATE</note>
with a troop of his dependants to <name type="person">Maroboduus</name>, 
simply for the reason that the aged uncle scorned to obey a brother's 
youthful son. The armies were drawn up, with equal confidence on both sides, 
and there were not those desultory attacks or irregular bands, formerly so 
common with the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>. Prolonged warfare against us had accustomed them to 
keep close to their standards, to have the support of reserves, and to take 
the word of command from their generals. On this occasion <name type="person">Arminius</name>, who 
reviewed the whole field on horseback, as he rode up to each band, boasted 
of regained freedom, of slaughtered legions, of spoils and weapons wrested 
from the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, and still in the hands of many of his men. As for 
<name type="person">Maroboduus</name>, he called him a fugitive, who had no experience of battles, who 
had sheltered himself in the recesses of the <rs type="placename">Hercynian 
forest</rs> and then with presents and embassies sued for a treaty; a 
traitor to his country, a satellite of <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, who deserved to be 
driven out, with rage as furious as that with which they had slain 
<name type="person">Quintilius Varus</name>. They should simply remember their many battles, the result 
of which, with the final expulsion of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, sufficiently showed who 
could claim the crowning success in war.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>Nor did <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> abstain from vaunts about himself or from 
revilings of the foe. Clasping the hand of <name type="person">Inguiomerus</name>, he protested "that 
in the person before them centred all the renown of the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, that to 
his counsels was due whatever had ended successfully. <name type="person">Arminius</name> in his 
infatuation and ignorance was taking to himself the glory which belonged to 
another, for he had treacherously surprised three unofficered legions and a 
general who had not an idea of perfidy, to the great hurt of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> and to his own disgrace, since his wife and his 
son were still enduring slavery. As for himself, he had been attacked by 
twelve legions led by <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and had preserved untarnished the glory of 
the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, and then on equal terms the armies had parted. He was by no 
means sorry that they had the matter in their own hands, whether they 
preferred to war with all their might against <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, 
or to accept a bloodless peace." </p>
<p>To these words, which roused the two 
armies, was added the stimulus of special motives of their own. The 
<name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>

and <name type="ethnic">Langobardi</name> were fighting for ancient renown or 
newly-won freedom; the other side for the increase of their dominion. Never 
at any time was the shock of battle more tremendous or the issue more 
doubtful, as the right wings of both armies were routed. Further fighting 
was expected, when <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> withdrew his camp to the hills. This was a 
sign of discomfiture. He was gradually stripped of his strength by 
desertions, and, having fled to the <name type="ethnic">Marcomanni</name>, he sent envoys to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
with entreaties for help. The answer was that he had no right to invoke the 
aid of Roman arms against the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, when he had rendered no assistance 
to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> in their conflict with the same enemy. <name type="person">Drusus</name>, however, was 
sent as I have related, to establish peace.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>That same year twelve famous cities of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> fell by an earthquake in the night, so that the 
destruction was all the more unforeseen and fearful. Nor were there the 
means of escape usual in such a disaster, by rushing out into the open 
country, for there people were swallowed up by the yawning earth. Vast 
mountains, it is said, collapsed; what had been level ground seemed to be 
raised aloft, and fires blazed out amid the ruin. The calamity fell most 
fatally on the inhabitants of <rs type="placename">Sardis</rs>, and it 
attracted to them the largest share of sympathy. The emperor promised ten 
million sesterces, and remitted for five years all they paid to the 
exchequer or to the emperor's purse. <rs type="placename">Magnesia</rs>, under 
<rs type="placename">Mount Sipylus</rs>, was considered to come next in loss 
and in need of help. The people of <rs type="placename">Temnus</rs>, <rs type="placename">Philadelpheia</rs>, <rs type="placename">Aegae</rs>, <rs type="placename">Apollonis</rs>, 
the <name type="ethnic">Mostenians</name>, and <name type="ethnic">Hyrcanian Macedonians</name>, as they were called, with the 
towns of <rs type="placename">Hieroc&aelig;sarea</rs>, <rs type="placename">Myrina</rs>, <rs type="placename">Cyme</rs>, and <rs type="placename">Tmolus</rs>, were, it was decided, to be exempted from 
tribute for the same time, and some one was to be sent from the Senate to 
examine their actual condition and to relieve them. <name type="person">Marcus Aletus</name>, one of 
the ex-pr&aelig;tors, was chosen, from a fear that, as an ex-consul was 
governor of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, there might be rivalry between men 
of equal rank, and consequent embarrassment.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>To his splendid public liberality the emperor added bounties no 
less popular. The property of <name type="person">Aemilia Musa</name>, a rich woman who died intestate, 
on which the imperial treas-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">EARTHQUAKES IN ASIA; 
BENEFACTIONS</note>
ury had a claim, he handed over to <name type="person">&AElig;milius 
Lepidus</name>, to whose family she appeared to belong; and the estate of 
<name type="person">Patuleius</name>, a wealthy Roman knight, though he was himself left in part his 
heir, he gave to <name type="person">Marcus Servilius</name>, whose name he discovered in an earlier 
and unquestioned will. In both these cases he said that noble rank ought to 
have the support of wealth. Nor did he accept a legacy from any one unless 
he had earned it by friendship. Those who were strangers to him, and who, 
because they were at enmity with others, made the emperor their heir, he 
kept at a distance. While, however, he relieved the honourable poverty of 
the virtuous, he expelled from the Senate or suffered voluntarily to retire 
spendthrifts whose vices had brought them to penury, like <name type="person">Vibidius Varro</name>, 
<name type="person">Marius Nepos</name>, <name type="person">Appius Appianus</name>, <name type="person">Cornelius Sulla</name>, and <name type="person">Quintus 
Vitellius</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>About the same time he 
dedicated some temples of the gods, which had perished from age or from 
fire, and which <name type="person">Augustus</name> had begun to restore. These were temples to <name type="person">Liber</name>, 
<name type="person">Libera</name>, and <name type="person">Ceres</name>, near the <rs type="placename">Great Circus</rs>, which last <name type="person">Aulus Postumius</name>, when 
Dictator, had vowed; a temple to <name type="person">Flora</name> in the same place, which had been 
built by <name type="person">Lucius</name> and <name type="person">Marcus Publicius</name>, &aelig;diles, and a temple to <name type="person">Janus</name>, 
which had been erected in the vegetable market by <name type="person">Caius Duilius</name>, who was the 
first to make the Roman power successful at sea and to win a naval triumph 
over the <name type="ethnic">Carthaginians</name>. A temple to <name type="person">Hope</name> was consecrated by <name type="person">Germanicus</name>; this 
had been vowed by <name type="person">Atilius</name> in that same war.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>Meantime the law of treason was gaining strength. <name type="person">Appuleia 
Varilia</name>, grand-niece of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, was accused of treason by an informer for 
having ridiculed the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s mother, in 
some insulting remarks, and for having been convicted of adultery, allied 
though she was to <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s house. Adultery, it was thought, was 
sufficiently guarded against by the <placeName key="tgn,2089671">Julian</placeName> law. As to the charge of treason, 
the emperor insisted that it should be taken separately, and that she should 
be condemned if she had spoken irreverently of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. Her insinuations 
against himself he did not wish to be the subject of judicial inquiry. When 
asked by the consul what he thought of the unfavourable speeches she was 
accused of having uttered against his

mother, he said nothing. 
Afterwards, on the next day of the Senate's meeting, he even begged in his 
mother's name that no words of any kind spoken against her might in any case 
be treated as criminal. He then acquitted <name type="person">Appuleia</name> of treason. For her 
adultery, he deprecated the severer penalty, and advised that she should be 
removed by her kinsfolk, after the example of our forefathers, to more than 
two hundred miles from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Her paramour, <name type="person">Manlius</name>, 
was forbidden to live in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> or <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>A contest 
then arose about the election of a pr&aelig;tor in the room of <name type="person">Vipstanus 
Gallus</name>, whom death had removed. <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and <name type="person">Drusus</name> (for they were still 
at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>) supported <name type="person">Haterius Agrippa</name>, a relative of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>. Many, on the other hand, endeavoured to make the number of 
children weigh most in favour of the candidates. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> rejoiced to see a 
strife in the Senate between his sons and the law. Beyond question the law 
was beaten, but not at once, and only by a few votes, in the same way as 
laws were defeated even when they were in force.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>In this same year a war broke out in <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, where the enemy was led by <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>. A 
<name type="ethnic">Numidian</name> by birth, he had served as an auxiliary in the Roman camp, then 
becoming a deserter, he at first gathered round him a roving band familiar 
with robbery, for plunder and for repine. After a while, he marshalled them 
like regular soldiers, under standards and in troops, till at last he was 
regarded as the leader, not of an undisciplined rabble, but of the 
Musulamian people. This powerful tribe, bordering on the deserts of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, and even then with none of the civilisation of 
cities, took up arms and drew their Moorish neighbours into the war. These 
too had a leader, <name type="person">Mazippa</name>. The army was so divided that <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> kept the 
picked men who were armed in Roman fashion within a camp, and familiarised 
them with a commander's authority, while <name type="person">Mazippa</name>, with light troops, spread 
around him fire, slaughter, and consternation. They had forced the <name type="ethnic">Ciniphii</name>, 
a far from contemptible tribe, into their cause, when <name type="person">Furius Camillus</name>, 
pro-consul of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, united in one force a legion 
and all the regularly enlisted allies, and, with an army insignificant 
indeed compared with the multitude of the <name type="ethnic">Numidians</name> and

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TACFARINAS REBELS IN <rs type="placename">AFRICA</rs></note>
<name type="ethnic">Moors</name>, marched against the enemy. There 
was nothing however which he strove so much to avoid as their eluding an 
engagement out of fear. It was by the hope of victory that they were lured 
on only to be defeated. The legion was in the army's centre; the light 
cohorts and two cavalry squadrons on its wings. Nor did <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> refuse 
battle. The <name type="ethnic">Numidians</name> were routed, and after a number of years the name of 
<name type="person">Furius</name> won military renown. Since the days of the famous deliverer of our 
city and his son <name type="person">Camillus</name>, fame as a general had fallen to the lot of other 
branches of the family, and the man of whom I am now speaking was regarded 
as an inexperienced soldier. All the more willingly did <name type="person">Tiberius</name> commemorate 
his achievements in the Senate, and the Senators voted him the ornaments of 
triumph, an honour which <name type="person">Camillus</name>, because of his unambitious life, enjoyed 
without harm.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>In the following year 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> held his third, <name type="person">Germanicus</name> his second, consulship. <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, 
however, entered on the office at <rs type="placename">Nicopolis</rs>, a city 
of <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs>, whither he had arrived by the coast of 
<rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs>, after having seen his brother <name type="person">Drusus</name>, who 
was then in <rs type="placename">Dalmatia</rs>, and endured a stormy voyage 
through the <rs type="placename">Adriatic</rs> and afterwards the <rs type="placename">Ionian Sea</rs>. He accordingly devoted a few days to the 
repair of his fleet, and, at the same time, in remembrance of his ancestors, 
he visited the bay which the victory of <rs type="placename">Actium</rs> had made famous, the spoils 
consecrated by <name type="person">Augustus</name>, and the camp of <name type="person">Antonius</name>. For, as I have said, 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> was his great-uncle, <name type="person">Antonius</name> his grandfather, and vivid images of 
disaster and success rose before him on the spot. Thence he went to <rs type="placename">Athens</rs>, and there, as a concession to our treaty with an 
allied and ancient city, he was attended only by a single lictor. The <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> 
welcomed him with the most elaborate honours, and brought forward all the 
old deeds and sayings of their countrymen, to give additional dignity to 
their flattery.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>Thence he directed his 
course to <rs type="placename">Eub&oelig;a</rs> and crossed to <rs type="placename">Lesbos</rs>, where <name type="person">Agrippina</name> for the last time was confined 
and gave birth to <name type="person">Julia</name>. He then penetrated to the remoter parts of the 
province of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, visited the Thracian cities, <rs type="placename">Perinthus</rs> and <rs type="placename">Byzantium</rs>; next, 
the narrow strait of the

the <rs type="placename">Propontis</rs> and 
the entrance of the <rs type="placename">Pontus</rs>, from an anxious wish to 
become acquainted with those ancient and celebrated localities. He gave 
relief, as he went, to provinces which had been exhausted by internal feuds 
or by the oppressions of governors. In his return he attempted to see the 
sacred mysteries of the <name type="ethnic">Samothracians</name>, but north winds which he encountered 
drove him aside from his course. And so after visiting <rs type="placename">Ilium</rs> and surveying a scene venerable from the 
vicissitudes of fortune and as the birth-place of our people, he coasted 
back along <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, and touched at <rs type="placename">Colophon</rs>, to consult the oracle of the Clarian <name type="person">Apollo</name>. 
There, it is not a woman, as at <rs type="placename">Delphi</rs>, but a priest 
chosen from certain families, generally from <rs type="placename">Miletus</rs>, who ascertains simply 
the number and the names of the applicants. Then descending into a cave and 
drinking a draught from a secret spring, the man, who is commonly ignorant 
of letters and of poetry, utters a response in verse answering to the 
thoughts conceived in the mind of any inquirer. It was said that he 
prophesied to <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, in dark hints, as oracles usually do, an early 
doom.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p><name type="person">Cneius Piso</name> meanwhile, that he 
might the sooner enter on his design, terrified the citizens of <rs type="placename">Athens</rs> by his tumultuous approach, and then reviled them 
in a bitter speech, with indirect reflections on <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, who, he said, 
had derogated from the honour of the Roman name in having treated with 
excessive courtesy, not the people of <rs type="placename">Athens</rs>, who 
indeed had been exterminated by repeated disasters, but a miserable medley 
of tribes. As for the men before him, they had been <name type="person">Mithridates</name>'s allies 
against <name type="person">Sulla</name>, allies of <name type="person">Antonius</name> against the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>. He taunted 
them too with the past, with their ill-success against the <name type="ethnic">Macedonians</name>, 
their violence to their own countrymen, for he had his own special grudge 
against this city, because they would not spare at his intercession one 
<name type="person">Theophilus</name> whom the Areopagus had condemned for forgery. Then, by sailing 
rapidly and by the shortest route through the <rs type="placename">Cyclades</rs>, he overtook <name type="person">Germanicus</name> at the island of <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs>. The prince was not ignorant of the slanders with 
which he had been assailed, but his good nature was such that when a storm 
arose and drove <name type="person">Piso</name> on rocks, and his enemy's destruction could have 
been

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GERMANICUS IN THE EAST; PISO'S 
HOSTILITY</note>
referred to chance, he sent some triremes, by the help of 
which he might be rescued from danger. But this did not soften <name type="person">Piso</name>'s heart. 
Scarcely allowing a day's interval, he left <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and hastened on in 
advance. When he reached <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> and the legions, he 
began, by bribery and favouritism, to encourage the lowest of the common 
soldiers, removing the old centurions and the strict tribunes and assigning 
their places to creatures of his own or to the vilest of the men, while he 
allowed idleness in the camp, licentiousness in the towns, and the soldiers 
to roam through the country and take their pleasure. He went such lengths in 
demoralizing them, that he was spoken of in their vulgar talk as the father 
of the legions. </p>
<p><name type="person">Plancina</name> too, instead of keeping herself within the 
proper limits of a woman, would be present at the evolutions of the cavalry 
and the man&oelig;uvres of the cohorts, and would fling insulting remarks at 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name> and <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. Some even of the good soldiers were inclined to a 
corrupt compliance, as a whispered rumour gained ground that the emperor was 
not averse to these proceedings. Of all this <name type="person">Germanicus</name> was aware, but his 
most pressing anxiety was to be first in reaching <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p>This had 
been of old an unsettled country from the character of its people and from 
its geographical position, bordering, as it does, to a great extent on our 
provinces and stretching far away to <rs type="placename">Media</rs>. It lies 
between two most mighty empires, and is very often at strife with them, 
hating <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and jealous of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs>. It had at this time no king, <name type="person">Vonones</name> having 
been expelled, but the nation's likings inclined towards <name type="person">Zeno</name>, son of 
<name type="person">Polemon</name>, king of <name type="person">Pontus</name>, who from his earliest infancy had imitated Armenian 
manners and customs, loving the chase, the banquet, and all the popular 
pastimes of barbarians, and who had thus bound to himself chiefs and people 
alike. <name type="person">Germanicus</name> accordingly, in the city of <rs type="placename">Artaxata</rs>, with the approval of the nobility, in the 
presence of a vast multitude, placed the royal diadem on his head. All paid 
him homage and saluted him as King <name type="person">Artaxias</name>, which name they gave him from 
the city. </p>
<p><rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs> meanwhile, which had been 
reduced to the form of a province, received as its governor <name type="person">Quintus 
Veranius</name>.

Some of the royal tributes were diminished, to inspire 
hope of a gentler rule under <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <name type="person">Quintus 
Serv&aelig;us</name> was appointed to <rs type="placename">Commagene</rs>, then first put under a 
pr&aelig;tor's jurisdiction.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>Successful as was this settlement of all the interests of our allies, it 
gave <name type="person">Germanicus</name> little joy because of the arrogance of <name type="person">Piso</name>. Though he had 
been ordered to march part of the legions into <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> under his own or his son's command, he had 
neglected to do either. At length the two met at <rs type="placename">Cyrrhus</rs>, the 
winter-quarters of the tenth legion, each controlling his looks, <name type="person">Piso</name> 
concealing his fears, <name type="person">Germanicus</name> shunning the semblance of menace. He was 
indeed, as I have said, a kind-hearted man. But friends who knew well how to 
inflame a quarrel, exaggerated what was true and added lies, alleging 
various charges against <name type="person">Piso</name>, <name type="person">Plancina</name>, and their sons. </p>
<p>At last, in the 
presence of a few intimate associates, <name type="person">Germanicus</name> addressed him in language 
such as suppressed resentment suggests, to which <name type="person">Piso</name> replied with haughty 
apologies. They parted in open enmity. After this <name type="person">Piso</name> was seldom seen at 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s tribunal, and if he ever sat by him, it was with a sullen 
frown and a marked display of opposition. He was even heard to say at a 
banquet given by the king of the <name type="ethnic">Nabat&aelig;ans</name>, when some golden crowns of 
great weight were presented to <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> and <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and light ones to 
<name type="person">Piso</name> and the rest, that the entertainment was given to the son of a Roman 
emperor, not of a Parthian king. At the same time he threw his crown on the 
ground, with a long speech against luxury, which, though it angered 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, he still bore with patience.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>Meantime envoys arrived from <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, king of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>. 
He had sent them to recall the memory of friendship and alliance, with an 
assurance that he wished for a renewal of the emblems of concord, and that 
he would in honour of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> yield the point of advancing to the bank of 
the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>. He begged meanwhile that <name type="person">Vonones</name> 
might not be kept in <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, where; by emissaries 
from an easy distance, he might draw the chiefs of the tribes into civil 
strife. <name type="person">Germanicus</name>' answer as to the alliance between <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> was dignified: 
as to the king's visit and

the respect shown to himself, it was graceful and modest. 
<name type="person">Vonones</name> was removed to <rs type="placename">Pompeiopolis</rs>, a city on the 
coast of <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>. This was not merely a concession 
to the request of <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, but was meant as an affront to <name type="person">Piso</name>, who had a 
special liking for <name type="person">Vonones</name>, because of the many attentions and presents by 
which he had won <name type="person">Plancina</name>'s favour.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>In 
the consulship of <name type="person">Marcus Silanus</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Norbanus</name>, <name type="person">Germanicus</name> set out for 
<rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> to study its antiquities. His ostensible 
motive however was solicitude for the province. He reduced the price of corn 
by opening the granaries, and adopted many practices pleasing to the 
multitude. He would go about without soldiers, with sandalled feet, and 
apparelled after the Greek fashion, in imitation of <name type="person">Publius Scipio</name>, who, it 
is said, habitually did the same in <rs type="placename">Sicily</rs>, even 
when the war with <rs type="placename">Carthage</rs> was still raging. 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> having gently expressed disapproval of his dress and manners, 
pronounced a very sharp censure on his visit to <rs type="placename">Alexandria</rs> without the emperor's leave, contrary to the 
regulations of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. That prince, among other secrets of imperial 
policy, had forbidden senators and Roman knights of the higher rank to enter 
<rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> except by permission, and he had specially 
reserved the country, from a fear that any one who held a province 
containing the key of the land and of the sea, with ever so small a force 
against the mightiest army, might distress <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> by 
famine.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p><name type="person">Germanicus</name>, however, who had 
not yet learnt how much he was blamed for his expedition, sailed up the <rs type="placename">Nile</rs> from the city of <rs type="placename">Canopus</rs> as 
his starting-point. <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> founded the place because <name type="person">Canopus</name>, pilot of one 
of their ships, had been buried there, when <name type="person">Menelaus</name> on his return to <rs type="placename">Greece</rs> was driven into a distant sea and to the shores 
of <rs type="placename">Libya</rs>. Thence he went to the river's nearest 
mouth, dedicated to a <name type="person">Hercules</name> who, the natives say, was born in the country 
and was the original hero, others, who afterwards showed like valour, having 
received his name. Next he visited the vast ruins of ancient <rs type="placename">Thebes</rs>. There yet remained on the towering piles 
Egyptian inscriptions, with a complete account of the city's past grandeur. 
One of the aged priests, who was desired to interpret the language of his 
country, related how once there had dwelt in <rs type="placename">Thebes</rs> 
seven hundred

thousand men of military age, and how with such an 
army king <name type="person">Rhamses</name> conquered <rs type="placename">Libya</rs>, <rs type="placename">Ethiopia</rs>, <rs type="placename">Media</rs>, <rs type="placename">Persia</rs>, <rs type="placename">Bactria</rs>, and <rs type="placename">Scythia</rs>, and held under his sway the countries inhabited 
by the <name type="ethnic">Syrians</name>, <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name>, and their neighbours, the <name type="ethnic">Cappadocians</name>, from the 
<rs type="placename">Bithynian</rs> to the <rs type="placename">Lycian sea</rs>. 
There was also to be read what tributes were imposed on these nations, the 
weight of silver and gold, the tale of arms and horses, the gifts of ivory 
and of perfumes to the temples, with the amount of grain and supplies 
furnished by each people, a revenue as magnificent as is now exacted by the 
might of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> or the power of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>But 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> also bestowed attention on other wonders. Chief of these were the 
stone image of <name type="person">Memnon</name>, which, when struck by the sun's rays, gives out the 
sound of a human voice; the pyramids, rising up like mountains amid almost 
impassable wastes of shifting sand, raised by the emulation and vast wealth 
of kings; the lake hollowed out of the earth to be a receptacle for the 
<rs type="placename">Nile</rs>'s overflow; and elsewhere the river's narrow channel and profound depth 
which no line of the explorer can penetrate. He then came to <rs type="placename">Elephantine</rs> and <rs type="placename">Syene</rs>, formerly 
the limits of the Roman empire, which now extends to the <rs type="placename">Red Sea</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>While 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> was spending the summer in visits to several provinces, <name type="person">Drusus</name> 
gained no little glory by sowing discord among the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> and urging them 
to complete the destruction of the now broken power of <name type="person">Maroboduus</name>. Among the 
<name type="ethnic">Gotones</name> was a youth of noble birth, <name type="person">Catualda</name> by name, who had formerly been 
driven into exile by the might of <name type="person">Maroboduus</name>, and who now, when the king's 
fortunes were declining, ventured on revenge. He entered the territory of 
the <name type="ethnic">Marcomanni</name> with a strong force, and, having corruptly won over the 
nobles to join him, burst into the palace and into an adjacent fortress. 
There he found the long-accumulated plunder of the <name type="ethnic">Suevi</name> and camp followers 
and traders from our provinces who had been attracted to an enemy's land, 
each from their various homes, first by the freedom of commerce, next by the 
desire of amassing wealth, finally by forgetfulness of their 
fatherland.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p><name type="person">Maroboduus</name>, now utterly 
deserted, had no resource but in the mercy of <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>. Having crossed 
the <rs type="placename">Danube</rs>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DRUSUS' DIPLOMATIC 
SUCCESSES IN <rs type="placename">GERMANY</rs></note>
where it flows by the 
province of <rs type="placename">Noricum</rs>, he wrote to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, not like 
a fugitive or a suppliant, bus as one who remembered his past greatness. 
When as a most famous king in former days he received invitations from many 
nations, he had still, he said, preferred the friendship of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> replied that he should have a safe and 
honourable home in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, if he would remain there, 
or, if his interests required something different, he might leave it under 
the same protection under which he had come. But in the Senate he maintained 
that <name type="person">Philip</name> had not been so formidable to the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, or <name type="person">Pyrrhus</name> or 
<name type="person">Antiochus</name> to the Roman people, as was <name type="person">Maroboduus</name>. The speech is extant, and 
in it he magnifies the man's's power, the ferocity of the tribes under his 
sway, his proximity to <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> as a foe, finally his 
own measures for his overthrow. The result was that <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> was kept at 
<rs type="placename">Ravenna</rs>, where his possible return was a menace to 
the <name type="ethnic">Suevi</name>, should they ever disdain obedience. But he never left <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> for eighteen years, living to old age and losing 
much of his renown through an excessive clinging to life. </p>
<p><name type="person">Catualda</name> had a 
like downfall and no better refuge. Driven out soon afterwards by the 
overwhelming strength of the <name type="ethnic">Hermundusi</name> led by <name type="person">Vibilius</name>, he was received and 
sent to <placeName key="tgn,7005552">Forum Julii</placeName>, a colony of Narbonensian <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>. 
The barbarians who followed the two kings, lest they might disturb the peace 
of the provinces by mingling with the population, were settled beyond the 
<rs type="placename">Danube</rs> between the rivers <rs type="placename">Marus</rs> and <rs type="placename">Cusus</rs>, under a king, 
<name type="person">Vannius</name>, of the nation of the <name type="ethnic">Quadi</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>Tidings having also arrived of <name type="person">Artaxias</name> being made king of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> by <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, the Senate decreed that both he 
and <name type="person">Drusus</name> should enter the city with an ovation. Arches too were raised 
round the sides of the temple of <name type="person">Mars</name> the Avenger, with statues of the two 
C&aelig;sars. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> was the more delighted at having established peace by 
wise policy than if he had finished a war by battle. And so next he planned 
a crafty scheme against <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name>, king of <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs>. 
That entire country had been in the possession of <name type="person">Rh&oelig;metalces</name>, after 
whose death <name type="person">Augustus</name> assigned half to the king's brother <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name>, half 
to his son <name type="person">Cotys</name>. In this division the cultivated lands, the towns, and what 
bordered on Greek territories, fell to <name type="person">Cotys</name>; the wild and barbarous

portion, with enemies on its frontier, to <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name>. The kings too 
themselves differed, <name type="person">Cotys</name> having a gentle and kindly temper, the other a 
fierce and ambitious spirit, which could not brook a partner. Still at first 
they lived in a hollow friendship, but soon <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name> overstepped his 
bounds and appropriated to himself what had been given to <name type="person">Cotys</name>, using force 
when he was resisted, though somewhat timidly under <name type="person">Augustus</name>, who having 
created both kingdoms would, he feared, avenge any contempt of his 
arrangement. When however he heard of the change of emperor, he let loose 
bands of freebooters and razed the fortresses, as a provocation to 
war.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>Nothing made <name type="person">Tiberius</name> so uneasy 
as an apprehension of the disturbance of any settlement. He commissioned a 
centurion to tell the kings not to decide their dispute by arms. <name type="person">Cotys</name> at 
once dismissed the forces which he had prepared. <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name>, with assumed 
modesty, asked for a place of meeting where, he said, they might settle 
their differences by an interview. There was little hesitation in fixing on 
a time, a place, finally on terms, as every point was mutually conceded and 
accepted, by the one out of good nature, by the other with a treacherous 
intent. <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name>, to ratify the treaty, as he said, further proposed a 
banquet; and when their mirth had been prolonged far into the night, and 
<name type="person">Cotys</name> amid the feasting and the wine was unsuspicious of danger, he loaded 
him with chains, though he appealed, on perceiving the perfidy, to the 
sacred character of a king, to the gods of their common house, and to the 
hospitable board. Having possessed himself of all <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs>, he wrote word to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> that a plot had been 
formed against him, and that he had forestalled the plotter. Meanwhile, 
under pretext of a war against the Bastarnian and Scythian tribes, he was 
strengthening himself with fresh forces of infantry and cavalry. </p>
<p>He 
received a conciliatory answer. If there was no treachery in his conduct, he 
could rely on his innocence, but neither the emperor nor the Senate would 
decide on the right or wrong of his cause without hearing it. He was 
therefore to surrender <name type="person">Cotys</name>, come in person and transfer from himself the 
odium of the charge.</p></div2>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">THRACIAN 
DISTURBANCES</note>
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>This letter <name type="person">Latinius 
Pandus</name>, proprietor of <rs type="placename">Moesia</rs>, sent to <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs>, with 
soldiers to whose custody <name type="person">Cotys</name> was to be delivered. <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name>, hesitating 
between fear and rage, preferred to be charged with an accomplished rather 
than with an attempted crime. He ordered <name type="person">Cotys</name> to be murdered and falsely 
represented his death as self-inflicted. Still the emperor did not change 
the policy which he had once for all adopted. On the death of <name type="person">Pandus</name>, whom 
<name type="person">Rhescuporis</name> accused of being his personal enemy, he appointed to the 
government of <rs type="placename">Moesia</rs> <name type="person">Pomponius Flaccus</name>, a veteran soldier, specially because 
of his close intimacy with the king and his consequent ability to entrap 
him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p><name type="person">Flaccus</name> on arriving in <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs> induced the king by great promises, though he 
hesitated and thought of his guilty deeds, to enter the Roman lines. He then 
surrounded him with a strong force under pretence of showing him honour, and 
the tribunes and centurions, by counsel, by persuasion, and by a more 
undisguised captivity the further he went, brought him, aware at last of his 
desperate plight, to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. He was accused before the 
Senate by the wife of <name type="person">Cotys</name>, and was condemned to be kept a prisoner far 
away from his kingdom. <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs> was divided between 
his son <name type="person">Rh&oelig;metalces</name>, who, it was proved, had opposed his father's 
designs, and the sons of <name type="person">Cotys</name>. As these were still minors, <name type="person">Trebellienus 
Rufus</name>, an expr&aelig;tor, was appointed to govern the kingdom in the 
meanwhile, after the precedent of our ancestors who sent <name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name> into 
<rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> as guardian to <name type="person">Ptolemy</name>'s children. <name type="person">Rhescuporis</name> 
was removed to <rs type="placename">Alexandria</rs>, and there attempting or 
falsely charged with attempting escape, was put to death.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>About the same time, <name type="person">Vonones</name>, who, as I have 
related, had been banished to <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>, endeavoured 
by bribing his guards to escape into <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, thence 
to <rs type="placename">Albania</rs> and <rs type="placename">Heniochia</rs>, 
and to his kinsman, the king of <rs type="placename">Scythia</rs>. Quitting 
the sea-coast on the pretence of a hunting expedition, he struck into 
trackless forests, and was soon borne by his swift steed to the river <rs type="placename">Pyramus</rs>, the bridges over which had been broken down by 
the natives as soon as they heard of the king's escape. Nor was there a ford 
by which it could be crossed. And so on the river's bank he was put in 
chains by

<name type="person">Vibius Fronto</name>, an officer of cavalry; and then <name type="person">Remmius</name>, 
an enrolled pensioner, who had previously been entrusted with the king's 
custody, in pretended rage, pierced him with his sword. Hence there was more 
ground for believing that the man, conscious of guilty complicity and 
fearing accusation, had slain <name type="person">Vonones</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p><name type="person">Germanicus</name> meanwhile, as he was returning from <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs>, found that all his directions to the legions and 
to the various cities had been repealed or reversed. This led to grievous 
insults on <name type="person">Piso</name>, while he as savagely assailed the prince. <name type="person">Piso</name> then 
resolved to quit <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. Soon he was detained there 
by the failing health of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, but when he heard of his recovery, 
while people were paying the vows they had offered for his safety, he went 
attended by his lictors, drove away the victims placed by the altars with 
all the preparations for sacrifice, and the festal gathering of the populace 
of <rs type="placename">Antioch</rs>. Then he left for <rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs> and awaited 
the result of the illness which had again attacked <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. The terrible 
intensity of the malady was increased by the belief that he had been 
poisoned by <name type="person">Piso</name>. And certainly there were found hidden in the floor and in 
the walls disinterred remains of human bodies, incantations and spells, and 
the name of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> inscribed on leaden tablets, half-burnt cinders 
smeared with blood, and other horrors by which in popular belief souls are 
devoted so the infernal deities. <name type="person">Piso</name> too was accused of sending emissaries 
to note curiously every unfavourable symptom of the illness.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p><name type="person">Germanicus</name> heard of all this with anger, no less 
than with fear. "If my doors," he said, "are to be besieged, if I must gasp 
out my last breath under my enemies' eyes, what will then be the lot of my 
most unhappy wife, of my infant children? Poisoning seems tedious; he is in 
eager haste to have the sole control of the province and the legions. But 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> is not yet fallen so low, nor will the murderer long retain the 
reward of the fatal deed." </p>
<p>He then addressed a letter to <name type="person">Piso</name>, 
renouncing his friendship, and, as many also state, ordered him to quit the 
province. <name type="person">Piso</name> without further delay weighed anchor, slackening his course 
that he might not have a long way to return should <name type="person">Germanicus</name>' death leave 
<rs type="placename">Syria</rs> open to him.</p></div2>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GERMANICUS' SUSPICIOUS DEATH</note>
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>For a brief space the prince's hopes rose; then his frame became 
exhausted, and, as his end drew near, he spoke as follows to the friends by 
his side:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Were I succumbing to nature, I should have just ground 
of complaint even against the gods for thus tearing me away in my youth by 
an untimely death from parents, children, country. Now, cut off by the 
wickedness of <name type="person">Piso</name> and <name type="person">Plancina</name>, I leave to your hearts my last entreaties. 
Describe to my father and brother, torn by what persecutions, entangled by 
what plots, I have ended by the worst of deaths the most miserable of lives. 
If any were touched by my bright prospects, by ties of blood, or even by 
envy towards me while I lived, they will weep that the once prosperous 
survivor of so many wars has perished by a woman's treachery. You will have 
the opportunity of complaint before the Senate, of an appeal to the laws. It 
is not the chief duty of friends to follow the dead with unprofitable 
laments, but to remember his wishes, to fulfil his commands. Tears for 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> even strangers will shed; vengeance must come from <emph>you</emph>, if 
you loved the man more than his fortune. Show the people of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> her who is the granddaughter of the Divine 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, as well as my consort; set before them my six children. Sympathy 
will be on the side of the accusers, and to those who screen themselves 
under infamous orders belief or pardon will be refused." </p>
<p>His friends 
clasped the dying man's right hand, and swore that they would sooner lose 
life than revenge.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>He then turned to 
his wife and implored her by the memory of her husband and by their common 
offspring to lay aside her high spirit, to submit herself to the cruel blows 
of fortune, and not, when she returned to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, to 
enrage by political rivalry those who were stronger than herself. This was 
said openly; other words were whispered, pointing, it was supposed, to his 
fears from <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. Soon afterwards he expired, to the intense sorrow of 
the province and of the neighbouring peoples. Foreign nations and kings 
grieved over him, so great was his courtesy to allies, his humanity to 
enemies. He inspired reverence alike by look and voice, and while he 
maintained the greatness and dignity of the highest rank, he had escaped the 
hatred that waits on arrogance.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>His funeral, though it lacked the family statues and procession, 
was honoured by panegyrics and a commemoration of his virtues. Some there 
were who, as they thought of his beauty, his age, and the manner of his 
death, the vicinity too of the country where he died, likened his end to 
that of <name type="person">Alexander the Great</name>. Both had a graceful person and were of noble 
birth; neither had much exceeded thirty years of age, and both fell by the 
treachery of their own people in strange lands. But <name type="person">Germanicus</name> was gracious 
to his friends, temperate in his pleasures, the husband of one wife, with 
only legitimate children. He was too no less a warrior, though rashness he 
had none, and, though after having cowed <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> by 
his many victories, he was hindered from crushing it into subjection. Had he 
had the sole control of affairs, had he possessed the power and title of a 
king, he would have attained military glory as much more easily as he had 
excelled <name type="person">Alexander</name> in clemency, in self-restraint, and in all other virtues. 
</p>
<p>As to the body which, before it was burnt, lay bare in the forum at <rs type="placename">Antioch</rs>, its destined place of burial, it is doubtful 
whether it exhibited the marks of poisoning. For men according as they 
pitied <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and were prepossessed with suspicion or were biased by 
partiality towards <name type="person">Piso</name>, gave conflicting accounts.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>Then followed a deliberation among the generals and 
other senators present about the appointment of a governor to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. The contest was slight among all but <name type="person">Vibius 
Marsus</name> and <name type="person">Cneius Sentius</name>, between whom there was a long dispute. Finally 
<name type="person">Marsus</name> yielded to <name type="person">Sentius</name> as an older and keener competitor. <name type="person">Sentius</name> at once 
sent to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> a woman infamous for poisonings in the 
province and a special favourite of <name type="person">Plancina</name>, <name type="person">Martina</name> by name, on the demand 
of <name type="person">Vitellius</name> and <name type="person">Veranius</name> and others, who were preparing the charges and the 
indictment as if a prosecution had already been commenced.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p><name type="person">Agrippina</name> meantime, worn out though she was with 
sorrow and bodily weakness, yet still impatient of everything which might 
delay her vengeance, embarked with the ashes of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and with her 
children, pitied by all. Here indeed was a woman of the highest nobility, 
and but lately because of her splendid union wont to be seen amid an ad-

miring and sympathizing 
throng, now bearing in her bosom the mournful relics of death, with an 
uncertain hope of revenge, with apprehensions for herself, repeatedly at 
fortune's mercy by reason of the ill-starred fruitfulness of her marriage. 
<name type="person">Piso</name> was at the <rs type="placename">island of Coos</rs> when tidings reached him that <name type="person">Germanicus</name> was 
dead. He received the news with extravagant joy, slew victims, visited the 
temples, with no moderation in his transports; while <name type="person">Plancina</name>'s insolence 
increased, and she then for the first time exchanged for the gayest attire 
the mourning she had worn for her lost sister.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="76"><p>Centurions streamed in, and hinted to <name type="person">Piso</name> that he had the 
sympathy of the legions at his command. "Go back," they said, "to the 
province which has not been rightfully taken from you, and is still vacant." 
While he deliberated what he was to do, his son, <name type="person">Marcus Piso</name>, advised speedy 
return to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. "As yet," he said, "you have not 
contracted any inexpiable guilt, and you need not dread feeble suspicions or 
vague rumours. Your strife with <name type="person">Germanicus</name> deserved hatred perhaps, but not 
punishment, and by your having been deprived of the province, your enemies 
have been fully satisfied. But if you return, should <name type="person">Sentius</name> resist you, 
civil war is begun, and you will not retain on your side the centurions and 
soldiers, who are powerfully swayed by the yet recent memory of their 
general and by a deep-rooted affection for the C&aelig;sars."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="77"><p>Against this view <name type="person">Domitius Celer</name>, one of <name type="person">Piso</name>'s 
intimate friends, argued that he ought to profit by the opportunity. "It was 
<name type="person">Piso</name>, not <name type="person">Sentius</name>, who had been appointed to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. 
It was to <name type="person">Piso</name> that the symbols of power and a pr&aelig;tor's jurisdiction 
and the legions had been given. In case of a hostile menace, who would more 
rightfully confront it by arms than the man who had received the authority 
and special commission of a governor? And as for rumours, it is best to 
leave time in which they may die away. Often the innocent cannot stand 
against the first burst of unpopularity. But if <name type="person">Piso</name> possesses himself of 
the army, and increases his resources, much which cannot be foreseen will 
haply turn out in his favour. Are we hastening to reach <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> along with the ashes of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, that, unheard 
and undefended, you may be hurried to ruin by the wailings of <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and 
the

first gossip of an ignorant mob? You have on your side the 
complicity of <name type="person">Augusta</name> and the emperor's favour, though in secret, and none 
mourn more ostentatiously over the death of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> than those who most 
rejoice at it."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="78"><p>Without much 
difficulty <name type="person">Piso</name>, who was ever ready for violent action, was led into this 
view. He sent a letter to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> accusing <name type="person">Germanicus</name> of luxury and 
arrogance, and asserting that, having been driven away to make room for 
revolution, he had resumed the command of the army in the same loyal spirit 
in which he had before held it. At the same time he put <name type="person">Domitius</name> on board a 
trireme, with an order to avoid the coast and to push on to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> through the open sea away from the islands. He 
formed into regular companies the deserters who flocked to him, armed the 
camp-followers, crossed with his ships to the mainland, intercepted a 
detachment of new levies on their way to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, and 
wrote word to the petty kings of <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs> that they 
were to help him with auxiliaries, the young <name type="person">Piso</name> actively assisting in all 
the business of war, though he had advised against undertaking 
it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="79"><p>And so they coasted along <rs type="placename">Lycia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Pamphylia</rs>, and on 
meeting the fleet which conveyed <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, both sides in hot anger at first 
armed for battle, and then in mutual fear confined themselves to revilings, 
<name type="person">Marsus Vibius</name> telling <name type="person">Piso</name> that he was to go to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> 
to defend himself. <name type="person">Piso</name> mockingly replied that he would be there as soon as 
the pr&aelig;tor who had to try poisoning cases had fixed a day for the 
accused and his prosecutors. </p>
<p>Meanwhile <name type="person">Domitius</name> having landed at <rs type="placename">Laodicea</rs>, a city of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, as he 
was on his way to the winter-quarters of the sixth legion, which was, he 
believed, particularly open to revolutionary schemes, was anticipated by its 
commander <name type="person">Pacuvius</name>. Of this <name type="person">Sentius</name> informed <name type="person">Piso</name> in a letter, and warned 
him not to disturb the armies by agents of corruption or the province by 
war. He gathered round him all whom he knew to cherish the memory of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, and to be opposed to his enemies, dwelling repeatedly on the 
greatness of the general, with hints that the State was being threatened 
with an armed attack, and he put himself at the head of a strong force, 
prepared for battle.</p></div2>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PISO PREPARES 
REVOLUTION</note>
<div2 type="chapter" n="80"><p><name type="person">Piso</name>, too, though his first 
attempts were unsuccessful, did not omit the safest precautions under 
present circumstances, but occupied a very strongly fortified position in 
<rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>, named <rs type="placename">Celenderis</rs>. He had raised to the 
strength of a legion the Cilician auxiliaries which the petty kings had 
sent, by mixing with them some deserters, and the lately intercepted 
recruits with his own and <name type="person">Plancina</name>'s slaves. And he protested that he, 
though <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s legate, was kept out of the province which <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> 
had given him, not by the legions (for he had come at their invitation) but 
by <name type="person">Sentius</name>, who was veiling private animosity under lying charges. "Only," 
he said, "stand in battle array, and the soldiers will not fight when they 
see that <name type="person">Piso</name> whom they themselves once called 'father,' is the stronger, if 
right is to decide; if arms, is far from powerless." </p>
<p>He then deployed 
his companies before the lines of the fortress on a high and precipitous 
hill, with the sea surrounding him on every other side. Against him were the 
veteran troops drawn up in ranks and with reserves, a formidable soldiery on 
one side, a formidable position on the other. But his men had neither heart 
nor hope, and only rustic weapons, extemporised for sudden use. When they 
came to fighting, the result was doubtful only while the Roman cohorts were 
struggling up to level ground; then, the <name type="ethnic">Cilicians</name> turned their backs and 
shut themselves up within the fortress.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="81"><p>Meanwhile <name type="person">Piso</name> vainly attempted an attack on the fleet which 
waited at a distance; he then went back, and as he stood before the walls, 
now smiting his breast, now calling on individual soldiers by name, and 
luring them on by rewards, sought to excite a mutiny. He had so far roused 
them that a standard bearer of the sixth legion went over to him with his 
standard. Thereupon <name type="person">Sentius</name> ordered the horns and trumpets to be sounded, 
the rampart to be assaulted, the scaling ladders to be raised, all the 
bravest men to mount on them, while others were to discharge from the 
engines spears, stones, and brands. At last <name type="person">Piso</name>'s obstinacy was overcome, 
and he begged that he might remain in the fortress on surrendering his arms, 
while the emperor was being consulted about the appointment of a governor to 
<rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. The proposed

terms were refused, 
and all that was granted him were some ships and a safe return to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="82"><p>There 
meantime, when the illness of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> was universally known, and all 
news, coming, as it did, from a distance, exaggerated the danger, there was 
grief and indignation. There was too an outburst of complaint. "Of course 
this was the meaning," they said, "of banishing him to the ends of the 
earth, of giving <name type="person">Piso</name> the province; this was the drift of <name type="person">Augusta</name>'s secret 
interviews with <name type="person">Plancina</name>. What elderly men had said of <name type="person">Drusus</name> was perfectly 
true, that rulers disliked a citizen-like temper in their sons, and the 
young princes had been put out of the way because they had the idea of 
comprehending in a restored era of freedom the Roman people under equal 
laws." </p>
<p>This popular talk was so stimulated by the news of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s 
death that even before the magistrate's proclamation or the Senate's 
resolution, there was a voluntary suspension of business, the public courts 
were deserted, and private houses closed. Everywhere there was a silence 
broken only by groans; nothing was arranged for mere effect. And though they 
refrained not from the emblems of the mourner, they sorrowed yet the more 
deeply in their hearts. </p>
<p>It chanced that some merchants who left <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> while <name type="person">Germanicus</name> was still alive, brought more 
cheering tidings about his health. These were instantly believed, instantly 
published. Every one passed on to others whom he met the intelligence, 
ill-authenticated as it was, and they again to many more, with joyous 
exaggeration. They ran to and fro through the city and broke open the doors 
of the temples. Night assisted their credulity, and amid the darkness 
confident assertion was comparatively easy. Nor did <name type="person">Tiberius</name> check the false 
reports till by lapse of time they died away.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="83"><p>And so the people grieved the more bitterly as though <name type="person">Germanicus</name> 
was again lost to them. New honours were devised and decreed, as men were 
inspired by affection for him or by genius. His name was to be celebrated in 
the song of the <name type="ethnic">Salii</name>; chairs of state with oaken garlands over them were to 
be set up in the places assigned to the priesthood of the Augustales; his 
image in ivory was to head the procession in the games of the circus; no 
flamen or augur,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">POPULAR MOURNING FOR 
GERMANICUS</note>
except from the <placeName key="tgn,2089671">Julian</placeName> family, was to be chosen in the 
room of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. Triumphal arches were erected at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, on the banks of the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, 
and on <rs type="placename">mount Amanus</rs> in <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, with an inscription recording his achievements, 
and how he had died in the public service. A cenotaph was raised at <rs type="placename">Antioch</rs>, where the body was burnt, a lofty mound at 
<rs type="placename">Epidaphna</rs>, where he had ended his life. The number of his statues, or of the 
places in which they were honoured, could not easily be computed. When a 
golden shield of remarkable size was voted him as a leader among orators, 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> declared that he would dedicate to him one of the usual kind, 
similar to the rest, for in eloquence, he said, there was no distinction of 
rank, and it was a sufficient glory for him to be classed among ancient 
writers. The knights called the seats in the theatre known as "the juniors," 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s benches, and arranged that their squadrons were to ride in 
procession behind his effigy on the fifteenth of July. Many of these honours 
still remain; some were at once dropped, or became obsolete with 
time.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="84"><p>While men's sorrow was yet 
fresh, <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s sister <name type="person">Livia</name>, who was married to <name type="person">Drusus</name>, gave birth to 
twin sons. This, as a rare event, causing joy even in humble homes, so 
delighted the emperor that he did not refrain from boasting before the 
senators that to no <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> of the same rank had twin offspring ever before 
been born. In fact, he would turn to his own glory every incident, however 
casual. But at such a time, even this brought grief to the people, who 
thought that the increase of <name type="person">Drusus</name>'s family still further depressed the 
house of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="85"><p>That same year 
the profligacy of women was checked by stringent enactments, and it was 
provided that no woman whose grandfather, father, or husband had been a 
Roman knight should get money by prostitution. <name type="person">Vistilia</name>, born of a 
pr&aelig;torian family, had actually published her name with this object on 
the &aelig;dile's list, according to a recognised custom of our ancestors, 
who considered it a sufficient punishment on unchaste women to have to 
profess their shame. <name type="person">Titidius Labeo</name>, <name type="person">Vistilia</name>'s husband, was judicially 
called on to say why with a wife whose guilt was manifest he had neglected 
to inflict the legal penalty. When he pleaded that the sixty

days 
given for deliberation had not yet expired, it was thought sufficient to 
decide <name type="person">Vistilia</name>'s case, and she was banished out of sight to the island of 
<rs type="placename">Seriphos</rs>. </p>
<p>There was a debate too about expelling 
the Egyptian and Jewish worship, and a resolution of the Senate was passed 
that four thousand of the freedmen class who were infected with those 
superstitions and were of military age should be transported to the island 
of <rs type="placename">Sardinia</rs>, to quell the brigandage of the place, a 
cheap sacrifice should they die from the pestilential climate. The rest were 
to quit <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, unless before a certain day they 
repudiated their impious rites.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="86"><p>Next 
the emperor brought forward a motion for the election of a <placeName key="tgn,2072890">Vestal</placeName> virgin in 
the room of <rs type="placename">Occia</rs>, who for fifty-seven years had presided with the most 
immaculate virtue over the <placeName key="tgn,2072890">Vestal</placeName> worship. He formally thanked <name type="person">Fonteius 
Agrippa</name> and <name type="person">Domitius Pollio</name> for offering their daughters and so vying with 
one another in zeal for the commonwealth. <name type="person">Pollio</name>'s daughter was preferred, 
only because her mother had lived with one and the same husband, while 
<name type="person">Agrippa</name> had impaired the honour of his house by a divorce. The emperor 
consoled his daughter, passed over though she was with a dowry of a million 
sesterces.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="87"><p>As the city populace 
complained of the cruel dearness of corn, he fixed a price for grain to be 
paid by the purchaser, promising himself to add two sesterces on every peck 
for the traders. But he would not therefore accept the title of "father of 
the country" which once before too had been offered him, and he sharply 
rebuked those who called his work "divine" and himself "lord." Consequently, 
speech was restricted and perilous under an emperor who feared freedom while 
he hated sycophancy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="88"><p>I find it stated 
by some writers and senators of the period that a letter from <name type="person">Adgandestrius</name>, 
chief of the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>, was read in the Senate, promising the death of 
<name type="person">Arminius</name>, if poison were sent for the perpetration of the murder, and that 
the reply was that it was not by secret treachery but openly and by arms 
that the people of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> avenged themselves on their 
enemies. A noble answer, by which <name type="person">Tiberius</name> sought to liken himself to those 
generals of old who had forbidden and even denounced the poisoning of king 
<name type="person">Pyrrhus</name>.

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DOMESTIC REGULATIONS; ARMINIUS' DEATH</note></p>
<p><name type="person">Arminius</name>, meanwhile, when the Romans retired and <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> 
was expelled, found himself opposed in aiming at the throne by his 
countrymen's independent spirit. He was assailed by armed force, and while 
fighting with various success, fell by the treachery of his kinsmen. 
Assuredly he was the deliverer of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, one too 
who had defied <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, not in her early rise, as other 
kings and generals, but in the height of her empire's glory, had fought, 
indeed, indecisive battles, yet in war remained unconquered. He completed 
thirty-seven years of life, twelve years of power, and he is still a theme 
of song among barbarous nations, though to Greek historians, who admire only 
their own achievements, he is unknown, and to <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> not as famous as he 
should be, while we extol the past and are indifferent to our own 
times.</p></div2></div1>

<head>BOOK III</head>
<head><dateRange from="20" to="22">A.D. 20, 21, 22</dateRange></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>WITHOUT pausing in her winter voyage <name type="person">Agrippina</name> arrived at the 
island of <rs type="placename">Corcyra</rs>, facing the shores of <rs type="placename">Calabria</rs>. There she spent a few days to compose her 
mind, for she was wild with grief and knew not how to endure. Meanwhile on 
hearing of her arrival, all her intimate friends and several officers, every 
one indeed who had served under <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, many strangers too from the 
neighbouring towns, some thinking it respectful to the emperor, and still 
more following their example, thronged eagerly to <rs type="placename">Brundisium</rs>, the nearest and safest landing place for a 
voyager. </p>
<p>As soon as the fleet was seen on the horizon, not only the 
harbour and the adjacent shores, but the city walls too and the roofs and 
every place which commanded the most distant prospect were filled with 
crowds of mourners, who incessantly asked one another, whether, when she 
landed, they were to receive her in silence or with some utterance of 
emotion. They were not agreed on what befitted the occasion when the fleet 
slowly approached, its crew, not joyous as is usual, but wearing all a 
studied expression of grief. When <name type="person">Agrippina</name> descended from the vessel with 
her two children, clasping the funeral urn, with eyes rivetted to the earth, 
there was one universal groan. You could not distinguish kinsfolk from 
strangers, or the laments of men from those of women; only the attendants of 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>, worn out as they were by long sorrow, were surpassed by the 
mourners who now met them, fresh in their grief.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>The emperor had despatched two pr&aelig;torian cohorts with 
instructions that the magistrates of <rs type="placename">Calabria</rs>, <rs type="placename">Apulia</rs>, and <rs type="placename">Campania</rs> were to pay 
the last honours to his son's memory. Accordingly tribunes and centurions 
bore <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s ashes on their shoulders. They were preceded by the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">POPULAR GRIEF, OFFICIAL INDIFFERENCE</note>
standards unadorned 
and the fasces reversed. As they passed colony after colony, the populace in 
black, the knights in their state robes, burnt vestments and perfumes with 
other usual funeral adjuncts, in proportion to the wealth of the place. Even 
those whose towns were out of the route, met the mourners, offered victims 
and built altars to the dead, testifying their grief by tears and wailings. 
<name type="person">Drusus</name> went as far as <rs type="placename">Tarracina</rs> with <name type="person">Claudius</name>, 
brother of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, and the children who had been at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <name type="person">Marcus Valerius</name> and <name type="person">Caius Aurelius</name>, the consuls, 
who had already entered on office, and a great number of the people thronged 
the road in scattered groups, every one weeping as he felt inclined. 
Flattery there was none, for all knew that <name type="person">Tiberius</name> could scarcely dissemble 
his joy at the death of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> and <name type="person">Augusta</name> refrained from showing themselves, thinking it below 
their dignity to shed tears in public, or else fearing that, if all eyes 
scrutinised their faces, their hypocrisy would be revealed. I do not find in 
any historian or in the daily register that <name type="person">Antonia</name>, <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s mother, 
rendered any conspicuous honour to the deceased, though besides <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, 
<name type="person">Drusus</name>, and <name type="person">Claudius</name>, all his other kinsfolk are mentioned by name. She may 
either have been hindered by illness, or with a spirit overpowered by grief 
she may not have had the heart to endure the sight of so great an 
affliction. But I can more easily believe that <name type="person">Tiberius</name> and <name type="person">Augusta</name>, who did 
not leave the palace, kept her within, that their sorrow might seem equal to 
hers, and that the grandmother and uncle might be thought to follow the 
mother's example in staying at home.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>The 
day on which the remains were consigned to the tomb of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, was now 
desolate in its silence, now distracted by lamentations. The streets of the 
city were crowded; torches were blazing throughout the <rs type="placename">Campus Martius</rs>. There 
the soldiers under arms, the magistrates without their symbols of office, 
the people in the tribes, were all incessantly exclaiming that the 
commonwealth was ruined, that not a hope remained, too boldly and openly to 
let one think that they remembered their rulers. But nothing impressed 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> more deeply than the enthusiasm kindled in favour of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, 
whom men spoke of as the glory of

the country, the sole surviving 
offspring of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, the solitary example of the old times, while looking 
up to heaven and the gods they prayed for the safety of her children and 
that they might outlive their oppressors.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>Some there were who missed the grandeur of a state-funeral, and 
contrasted the splendid honours conferred by <name type="person">Augustus</name> on <name type="person">Drusus</name>, the father 
of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. "Then the emperor himself," they said, "went in the extreme 
rigour of winter as far as <rs type="placename">Ticinum</rs>, and never 
leaving the corpse entered <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> with it. Round the 
funeral bier were ranged the images of the Claudii and the Julii; there was 
weeping in the forum, and a panegyric before the rostra; every honour 
devised by our ancestors or invented by their descendants was heaped on him. 
But as for <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, even the customary distinctions due to any noble had 
not fallen to his lot. Granting that his body, because of the distance of 
the journey, was burnt in any fashion in foreign lands, still all the more 
honours ought to have been afterwards paid him, because at first chance had 
denied them. His brother had gone but one day's journey to meet him; his 
uncle, not even to the city gates. Where were all those usages of the past, 
the image at the head of the bier, the lays composed in commemoration of 
worth, the eulogies and laments, or at least the semblance of 
grief?"</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>All this was known to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
and, to silence popular talk, he reminded the people in a proclamation that 
many eminent <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had died for their country and that none had been 
honoured with such passionate regret. This regret was a glory both to 
himself and to all, provided only a due mean were observed; for what was 
becoming in humble homes and communities, did not befit princely personages 
and an imperial people. Tears and the solace found in mourning were suitable 
enough for the first burst of grief; but now they must brace their hearts to 
endurance, as in former days the Divine <name type="person">Julius</name> after the loss of his only 
daughter, and the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> when he was bereft of his grandchildren, 
had thrust away their sorrow. There was no need of examples from the past, 
showing how often the Roman people had patiently endured the defeats of 
armies, the destruction of generals, the total extinction of noble

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DRUSUS TO <rs type="placename">ILLYRICUM</rs></note>
families. 
Princes were mortal; the State was everlasting. Let them then return to 
their usual pursuits, and, as the shows of the festival of the Great Goddess 
were at hand, even resume their amusements.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>The suspension of business then ceased, and men went back to their 
occupations. <name type="person">Drusus</name> was sent to the armies of <rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs>, amidst an universal eagerness to exact 
vengeance on <name type="person">Piso</name>, and ceaseless complaints that he was meantime roaming 
through the delightful regions of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs>, and was weakening the proofs of his guilt by an 
insolent and artful procrastination. It was indeed widely rumoured that the 
notorious poisoner <name type="person">Martina</name>, who, as I have related, had been despatched to 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> by <name type="person">Cneius Sentius</name>, had died suddenly at <rs type="placename">Brundisium</rs>; that poison was concealed in a knot of her 
hair, and that no symptoms of suicide were discovered on her 
person.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p><name type="person">Piso</name> meanwhile sent his son on 
to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> with a message intended to pacify the 
emperor, and then made his way to <name type="person">Drusus</name>, who would, he hoped, be not so 
much infuriated at his brother's death as kindly disposed towards himself in 
consequence of a rival's removal. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, to show his impartiality, 
received the youth courteously, and enriched him with the liberality he 
usually bestowed on the sons of noble families. <name type="person">Drusus</name> replied to <name type="person">Piso</name> that 
if certain insinuations were true, he must be foremost in his resentment, 
but he preferred to believe that they were false and groundless, and that 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s death need be the ruin of no one. This he said openly, avoiding 
anything like secrecy. Men did not doubt that his answer was prescribed him 
by <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, inasmuch as one who had generally all the simplicity and 
candour of youth, now had recourse to the artifices of old age.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p><name type="person">Piso</name>, after crossing the <rs type="placename">Dalmatian 
sea</rs> and leaving his ships at <rs type="placename">Ancona</rs>, went 
through <rs type="placename">Picenum</rs> and along the <rs type="placename">Flaminian road</rs>, where 
he overtook a legion which was marching from <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs> to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and was then to 
garrison <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>. It was a matter of common talk how 
he had repeatedly displayed himself to the soldiers on the road during the 
march. From <rs type="placename">Narnia</rs>, to avoid suspicion or because 
the plans of fear are uncertain, he sailed down the <rs type="placename">Nar</rs>, then down the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, and 
increased the fury of the populace by bringing his vessel

to 
shore at the tomb of the C&aelig;sars. In broad daylight, when the 
river-bank was thronged, he himself with a numerous following of dependents, 
and <name type="person">Plancina</name> with a retinue of women, moved onward with joy in their 
countenances. Among other things which provoked men's anger was his house 
towering above the forum, gay with festal decorations, his banquets and his 
feasts, about which there was no secrecy, because the place was so 
public.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>Next day, <name type="person">Fulcinius Trio</name> asked 
the consul's leave to prosecute <name type="person">Piso</name>. It was contended against him by 
<name type="person">Vitellius</name> and <name type="person">Veranius</name> and the others who had been the companions of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, that this was not <name type="person">Trio</name>'s proper part, and that they themselves 
meant to report their instructions from <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, not as accusers, but as 
deponents and witnesses to facts. <name type="person">Trio</name>, abandoning the prosecution on this 
count, obtained leave to accuse <name type="person">Piso</name>'s previous career, and the emperor was 
requested to undertake the inquiry. This even the accused did not refuse, 
fearing, as he did, the bias of the people and of the Senate; while 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, he knew, was resolute enough to despise report, and was also 
entangled in his mother's complicity. Truth too would be more easily 
distinguished from perverse misrepresentation by a single judge, where a 
number would be swayed by hatred and ill-will. </p>
<p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> was not unaware 
of the formidable difficulty of the inquiry and of the rumours by which he 
was himself assailed. Having therefore summoned a few intimate friends, he 
listened to the threatening speeches of the prosecutors and to the pleadings 
of the accused, and finally referred the whole case to the 
Senate.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p><name type="person">Drusus</name> meanwhile, on his 
return from <rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs>, though the Senate had voted 
him an ovation for the submission of <name type="person">Maroboduus</name> and the successes of the 
previous summer, postponed the honour and entered <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Then the defendant sought the advocacy of <name type="person">Lucius 
Arruntius</name>, <name type="person">Marcus Vinicius</name>, <name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name>, <name type="person">Aeserninus Marcellus</name> and <name type="person">Sextus 
Pompeius</name>, and on their declining for different reasons, <name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name>, 
<name type="person">Lucius Piso</name>, and <name type="person">Livineius Regulus</name> became his counsel, amid the excitement 
of the whole country, which wondered how much fidelity would be shown by the 
friends of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, on what the accused rested his hopes, and

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROSECUTION OF PISO</note>
how far <name type="person">Tiberius</name> would repress and 
hide his feelings. Never were the people more keenly interested; never did 
they indulge themselves more freely in secret whispers against the emperor 
or in the silence of suspicion.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>On the 
day the Senate met, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> delivered a speech of studied moderation. 
"<name type="person">Piso</name>," he said, "was my father's representative and friend, and was 
appointed by myself on the advice of the Senate, to assist <name type="person">Germanicus</name> in the 
administration of the East. Whether he there had provoked the young prince 
by wilful opposition and rivalry, and had rejoiced at his death or wickedly 
destroyed him, is for you to determine with minds unbiassed. Certainly if a 
subordinate oversteps the bounds of duty and of obedience to his commander, 
and has exulted in his death and in my affliction, I shall hate him and 
exclude him from my house, and I shall avenge a personal quarrel without 
resorting to my power as emperor. If however a crime is discovered which 
ought to be punished, whoever the murdered man may be, it is for you to give 
just reparation both to the children of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and to us, his parents. 
</p>
<p>"Consider this too, whether <name type="person">Piso</name> dealt with the armies in a 
revolutionary and seditious spirit; whether he sought by intrigue popularity 
with the soldiers; whether he attempted to repossess himself of the province 
by arms, or whether these are falsehoods which his accusers have published 
with exaggeration. As for them, I am justly angry with their intemperate 
zeal. For to what purpose did they strip the corpse and expose it to the 
pollution of the vulgar gaze, and circulate a story among foreigners that he 
was destroyed by poison, if all this is still doubtful and requires 
investigation? For my part, I sorrow for my son and shall always sorrow for 
him; still I would not hinder the accused from producing all the evidence 
which can relieve his innocence or convict <name type="person">Germanicus</name> of any unfairness, if 
such there was. And I implore you not to take as proven charges alleged, 
merely because the case is intimately bound up with my affliction. Do you, 
whom ties of blood or your own true-heartedness have made his advocates, 
help him in his peril, every one of you, as far as each man's eloquence and 
diligence can do so. To like exertions and like persistency I would urge the 
prosecu-

tors. In this, and in this only, will we place 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> above the laws, by conducting the inquiry into his death in this 
house instead of in the forum, and before the Senate instead of before a 
bench of judges. In all else let the case be tried as simply as others. Let 
no one heed the tears of Drusus or my own sorrow, or any stories invented to 
our discredit."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>Two days were then 
assigned for the bringing forward of the charges, and after six days' 
interval, the prisoner's defence was to occupy three days. Thereupon 
<name type="person">Fulcinius Trio</name> began with some old and irrelevant accusations about 
intrigues and extortion during <name type="person">Piso</name>'s government of <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>. This, if proved, would not have been fatal to the 
defendant, if he cleared himself as to his late conduct, and, if refuted, 
would not have secured his acquittal, if he were convicted of the greater 
crimes. Next, <name type="person">Serv&aelig;us</name>, <name type="person">Veranius</name>, and <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, all with equal 
earnestness, <name type="person">Vitellius</name> with striking eloquence, alleged against <name type="person">Piso</name> that 
out of hatred of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and a desire of revolution he had so corrupted 
the common soldiers by licence and oppression of the allies that he was 
called by the vilest of them "father of the legions," while on the other 
hand to all the best men, especially to the companions and friends of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, he had been savagely cruel. Lastly, he had, they said, destroyed 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> himself by sorceries and poison, and hence came those ceremonies 
and horrible sacrifices made by himself and <name type="person">Plancina</name>; then he had threatened 
the State with war, and had been defeated in battle, before he could be 
tried as a prisoner.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>On all points 
but one the defence broke down. That he had tampered with the soldiers, that 
his province had been at the mercy of the vilest of them, that he had even 
insulted his chief, he could not deny. It was only the charge of poisoning 
from which he seemed to have cleared himself. This indeed the prosecutors 
did not adequately sustain by merely alleging that at a banquet given by 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, his food had been tainted with poison by the hands of <name type="person">Piso</name> who 
sat next above him. It seemed absurd to suppose that he would have dared 
such an attempt among strange servants, in the sight of so many bystanders, 
and under <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s own eyes. And, besides, the defendant offered his 
slaves to

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PISO'S SUSPICIOUS DEATH</note>
the torture, and 
insisted on its application to the attendants on that occasion. But the 
judges for different reasons were merciless, the emperor, because war had 
been made on a province, the Senate because they could not be sufficiently 
convinced that there had been no treachery about the death of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. 
</p>
<p>At the same time shouts were heard from the people in front of the 
Senate House, threatening violence if he escaped the verdict of the 
Senators. They had actually dragged <name type="person">Piso</name>'s statues to the <rs type="placename">Gemonian stairs</rs>, 
and were breaking them in pieces, when by the emperor's order they were 
rescued and replaced. <name type="person">Piso</name> was then put in a litter and attended by a 
tribune of one of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts, who followed him so it was 
variously rumoured, to guard his person or to be his executioner.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p><name type="person">Plancina</name> was equally detested, but had 
stronger interest. Consequently it was considered a question how far the 
emperor would be allowed to go against her. While <name type="person">Piso</name>'s hopes were in 
suspense, she offered to share his lot, whatever it might be, and in the 
worst event, to be his companion in death. But as soon as she had secured 
her pardon through the secret intercessions of <name type="person">Augusta</name>, she gradually 
withdrew from her husband and separated her defence from his. When the 
prisoner saw that this was fatal to him, he hesitated whether he should 
still persist, but at the urgent request of his sons braced his courage and 
once more entered the Senate. There he bore patiently the renewal of the 
accusation, the furious voices of the Senators, savage opposition indeed 
from every quarter, but nothing daunted him so much as to see <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
without pity and without anger, resolutely closing himself against any 
inroad of emotion. He was conveyed back to his house, where, seemingly by 
way of preparing his defence for the next day, he wrote a few words, sealed 
the paper and handed it to a freedman. Then he bestowed the usual attention 
on his person; after a while, late at night, his wife having left his 
chamber, he ordered the doors to be closed, and at daybreak was found with 
his throat cut and a sword lying on the ground.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>I remember to have heard old men say that a document was often 
seen in <name type="person">Piso</name>'s hands, the substance of which

he never himself 
divulged, but which his friends repeatedly declared contained a letter from 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> with instructions referring to <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, and that it was his 
intention to produce it before the Senate and upbraid the emperor, had he 
not been deluded by vain promises from <name type="person">Sejanus</name>. Nor did he perish, they 
said, by his own hand, but by that of one sent to be his executioner. 
Neither of these statements would I positively affirm; still it would not 
have been right for me to conceal what was related by those who lived up to 
the time of my youth. </p>
<p>The emperor, assuming an air of sadness, 
complained in the Senate that the purpose of such a death was to bring odium 
on himself, and he asked with repeated questionings how <name type="person">Piso</name> had spent his 
last day and night. Receiving answers which were mostly judicious, though in 
part somewhat incautious, he read out a note written by <name type="person">Piso</name>, nearly to the 
following effect:&mdash; </p>
<p>"Crushed by a conspiracy of my foes and the 
odium excited by a lying charge, since my truth and innocence find no place 
here, I call the immortal gods to witness that towards you <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, I 
have lived loyally, and with like dutiful respect towards your mother. And I 
implore you to think of my children, one of whom, <name type="person">Cneius Piso</name>, is in no way 
implicated in my career, whatever it may have been, seeing that all this 
time he has been at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, while the other, <name type="person">Marcus 
Piso</name>, dissuaded me from returning to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. Would that I had yielded to my 
young son rather than he to his aged father! And therefore I pray the more 
earnestly that the innocent may not pay the penalty of my wickedness. By 
forty-five years of obedience, by my association with you in the consulate, 
as one who formerly won the esteem of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, your father, as 
one who is your friend and will never hereafter ask a favour, I implore you 
to save my unhappy son." About <name type="person">Plancina</name> he added not a word.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> after this acquitted the young <name type="person">Piso</name> of the 
charge of civil war on the ground that a son could not have refused a 
father's orders, compassionating at the same time the high rank of the 
family and the terrible downfall even of <name type="person">Piso</name> himself, however he might have 
deserved it. For <name type="person">Plancina</name> he spoke with shame and conscious disgrace, 
alleg-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">YOUNG PISO AND PLANCINA SPARED</note>
ing in excuse 
the intercession of his mother, secret complaints against whom from all good 
men were growing more and more vehement. "So it was the duty of a 
grandmother," people said, "to look a grandson's murderess in the face, to 
converse with her and rescue her from the Senate. What the laws secure on 
behalf of every citizen, had to <name type="person">Germanicus</name> alone been denied. The voices of 
a <name type="person">Vitellius</name> and <name type="person">Veranius</name> had bewailed a <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, while the emperor and 
<name type="person">Augusta</name> had defended <name type="person">Plancina</name>. She might as well now turn her poisonings, 
and her devices which had proved so successful, against <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and her 
children, and thus sate this exemplary grandmother and uncle with the blood 
of a most unhappy house." </p>
<p>Two days were frittered away over this mockery 
of a trial, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> urging <name type="person">Piso</name>'s children to defend their mother. While 
the accusers and their witnesses pressed the prosecution with rival zeal, 
and there was no reply, pity rather than anger was on the increase. <name type="person">Aurelius 
Cotta</name>, the consul, who was first called on for his vote (for when the 
emperor put the question, even those in office went through the duty of 
voting), held that <name type="person">Piso</name>'s name ought to be erased from the public register, 
half of his property confiscated, half given up to his son, <name type="person">Cneius Piso</name>, who 
was to change his first name; that <name type="person">Marcus Piso</name>, stript of his rank, with an 
allowance of five million sesterces, should be banished for ten years, 
<name type="person">Plancina</name>'s life being spared in consideration of <name type="person">Augusta</name>'s 
intercession.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>Much of the sentence 
was mitigated by the emperor. The name of <name type="person">Piso</name> was not to be struck out of 
the public register, since that of <name type="person">Marcus Antonius</name> who had made war on his 
country, and that of <name type="person">Julius Antonius</name> who had dishonoured the house of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, still remained. <name type="person">Marcus Piso</name> too he saved from degradation, and 
gave him his father's property, for he was firm enough, as I have often 
related, against the temptation of money, and now for very shame at 
<name type="person">Plancina</name>'s acquittal, he was more than usually merciful. Again, when 
<name type="person">Valerius Messalinus</name> and <name type="person">C&aelig;cina Severus</name> proposed respectively the 
erection of a golden statue in the temple of <name type="person">Mars</name> the Avenger and of an 
altar to Vengeance, he interposed, protesting that victories over the 
foreigner

were commemorated with such monuments, but that 
domestic woes ought to be shrouded in silent grief. </p>
<p>There was a further 
proposal of <name type="person">Messalinus</name>, that <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, <name type="person">Augusta</name>, <name type="person">Antonia</name>, <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and 
<name type="person">Drusus</name> ought to be publicly thanked for having avenged <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. He 
omitted all mention of <name type="person">Claudius</name>. Thereupon he was pointedly asked by <name type="person">Lucius 
Asprenas</name> before the Senate, whether the omission had been intentional, and 
it was only then that the name of <name type="person">Claudius</name> was added. For my part, the wider 
the scope of my reflection on the present and the past, the more am I 
impressed by their mockery of human plans in every transaction. Clearly, the 
very last man marked out for empire by public opinion, expectation and 
general respect was he whom fortune was holding in reserve as the emperor of 
the future.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>A few days afterwards the 
emperor proposed to the Senate to confer the priesthood on <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, 
<name type="person">Veranius</name> and <name type="person">Serv&aelig;us</name>. To <name type="person">Fulcinius</name> he promised his support in seeking 
promotion, but warned him not to ruin his eloquence by rancour. This was the 
end of avenging the death of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, a subject of conflicting rumours 
not only among the people then living but also in after times. So obscure 
are the greatest events, as some take for granted any hearsay, whatever its 
source, others turn truth into falsehood, and both errors find encouragement 
with posterity. </p>
<p><name type="person">Drusus</name> meanwhile quitted <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> to 
resume his command and soon afterwards re-entered the city with an ovation. 
In the course of a few days his mother <name type="person">Vipsania</name> died, the only one of all 
<name type="person">Agrippa</name>'s children whose death was without violence. As for the rest, they 
perished, some it is certain by the sword, others it was believed by poison 
or starvation.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>That same year 
<name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> who had been defeated, as I have related, by <name type="person">Camillus</name> in the 
previous summer, renewed hostilities in <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, 
first by mere desultory raids, so swift as to be unpunished; next, by 
destroying villages and carrying off plunder wholesale. Finally, he hemmed 
in a Roman cohort near the river <rs type="placename">Pagyda</rs>. The 
position was commanded by <name type="person">Decrius</name>, a soldier energetic in action and 
experienced in war, who regarded the siege as a disgrace. Cheering on his 
men to offer battle in the open plain, he

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TACFARINAS RENEWS 
AFRICAN WAR</note>
drew up his line in front of his intrenchments. At the 
first shock, the cohort was driven back, upon which he threw himself 
fearlessly amid the missiles in the path of the fugitives and cried shame on 
the standard-bearers for letting Roman soldiers show their backs to a rabble 
of deserters. At the same moment he was covered with wounds, and though 
pierced through the eye, he resolutely faced the enemy and ceased not to 
fight till he fell deserted by his men.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>On receiving this information, <name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>, successor to 
<name type="person">Camillus</name>, alarmed more by the dishonour of his own men than by the glory of 
the enemy, ventured on a deed quite exceptional at that time and derived 
from old tradition. He flogged to death every tenth man drawn by lot from 
the disgraced cohort. So beneficial was this rigour that a detachment of 
veterans, numbering not more than five hundred, routed those same troops of 
<name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> on their attacking a fortress named <rs type="placename">Thala</rs>. In this engagement 
<name type="person">Rufus Helvius</name>, a common soldier, won the honour of saving a citizen's life, 
and was rewarded by <name type="person">Apronius</name> with a neck-chain and a spear. To these the 
emperor added the civic crown, complaining, but without anger, that <name type="person">Apronius</name> 
had not used his right as pro-consul to bestow this further distinction. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>, however, finding that the <name type="ethnic">Numidians</name> were cowed and had a 
horror of siege-operations, pursued a desultory warfare, retreating when he 
was pressed, and then again hanging on his enemy's rear. While the barbarian 
continued these tactics, he could safely insult the baffled and exhausted 
<name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. But when he marched away towards the coast and, hampered with booty, 
fixed himself in a regular camp, <name type="person">C&aelig;sianus</name> was despatched by his father 
<name type="person">Apronius</name> with some cavalry and auxiliary infantry, reinforced by the most 
active of the legionaries, and, after a successful battle with the 
<name type="ethnic">Numidians</name>, drove them into the desert.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile <name type="person">Lepida</name>, who beside the 
glory of being one of the <name type="ethnic">&AElig;milii</name> was the great-granddaughter of <name type="person">Lucius 
Sulla</name> and <name type="person">Cneius Pompeius</name>, was accused of pretending to be a mother by 
<name type="person">Publius Quirinus</name>, a rich and childless man. Then, too, there were charges of 
adulteries, of poisonings, and of inquiries made through astrologers 
concerning

the imperial house. The accused was defended by her 
brother <name type="person">Manius Lepidus</name>. <name type="person">Quirinus</name> by his relentless enmity even after his 
divorce, had procured for her some sympathy, infamous and guilty as she was. 
One could not easily perceive the emperor's feelings at her trial; so 
effectually did he interchange and blend the outward signs of resentment and 
compassion. He first begged the Senate not to deal with the charges of 
treason, and subsequently induced <name type="person">Marcus Servilius</name>, an ex-consul, to divulge 
what he had seemingly wished to suppress. He also handed over to the consuls 
<name type="person">Lepida</name>'s slaves, who were in military custody, but would not allow them to 
be examined by torture on matters referring to his own family. <name type="person">Drusus</name> too, 
the consul-elect, he released from the necessity of having to speak first to 
the question. Some thought this a gracious act, done to save the rest of the 
Senators from a compulsory assent, while others ascribed it to malignity, on 
the ground that he would have yielded only where there was a necessity of 
condemning.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>On the days of the games 
which interrupted the trial, <name type="person">Lepida</name> went into the theatre with some ladies 
of rank, and as she appealed with piteous wailings to her ancestors and to 
that very <name type="person">Pompey</name>, the public buildings and statues of whom stood there 
before their eyes, she roused such sympathy that people burst into tears and 
shouted, without ceasing, savage curses on <name type="person">Quirinus</name>, "to whose childless 
old-age and miserably obscure family, one once destined to be the wife of 
<name type="person">Lucius C&aelig;sar</name> and the daughter-in-law of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> was being 
sacrificed." Then, by the torture of the slaves, her infamies were brought 
to light, and a motion of <name type="person">Rubellius Blandus</name> was carried which outlawed her. 
<name type="person">Drusus</name> supported him, though others had proposed a milder sentence. 
Subsequently, <name type="person">Scaurus</name>, who had had a daughter by her, obtained as a 
concession that her property should not be confiscated. Then at last 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> declared that he had himself too ascertained from the slaves of 
<name type="person">Publius Quirinus</name> that <name type="person">Lepida</name> had attempted their master's life by 
poison.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>It was some compensation for 
the misfortunes of great houses (for within a short interval the Calpurnii 
had lost <name type="person">Piso</name> and the &AElig;milii <name type="person">Lepida</name>) that <name type="person">Decimus Silanus </name>was now

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">LEPIDA CONVICTED</note>
restored to the Junian family. I will 
briefly relate his downfall. </p>
<p>Though the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> in his public 
life enjoyed unshaken prosperity, he was unfortunate at home from the 
profligacy of his daughter and granddaughter, both of whom he banished from 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and punished their paramours with death or 
exile. Calling, as he did, a vice so habitual among men and women by the 
awful name of sacrilege and treason, he went far beyond the indulgent spirit 
of our ancestors, beyond indeed his own legislation. But I will relate the 
deaths of others with the remaining events of that time, if after finishing 
the work I have now proposed to myself, I prolong my life for further 
labours. </p>
<p><name type="person">Decimus Silanus</name>, the paramour of the granddaughter of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, 
though the only severity he experienced was exclusion from the emperor's 
friendship, saw clearly that it meant exile; and it was not till <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s 
reign that he ventured to appeal to the Senate and to the prince, in 
reliance on the influence of his brother <name type="person">Marcus Silanus</name>, who was conspicuous 
both for his distinguished rank and eloquence. But <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, when <name type="person">Silanus</name> 
thanked him, replied in the Senate's presence, "that he too rejoiced at the 
brother's return from his long foreign tour, and that this was justly 
allowable, inasmuch as he had been banished not by a decree of the Senate or 
under any law. Still, personally," he said, "he felt towards him his 
father's resentment in all its force, and the return of <name type="person">Silanus</name> had not 
cancelled the intentions of <name type="person">Augustus</name>." <name type="person">Silanus</name> after this lived at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> without attaining office.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>It was next proposed to relax the Papia 
Popp&aelig;a law, which <name type="person">Augustus</name> in his old age had passed subsequently to 
the <placeName key="tgn,2089671">Julian</placeName> statutes, for yet further enforcing the penalties on celibacy and 
for enriching the exchequer. And yet, marriages and the rearing of children 
did not become more frequent, so powerful were the attractions of a 
childless state. Meanwhile there was an increase in the number of persons 
imperilled, for every household was undermined by the insinuations of 
informers; and now the country suffered from its laws, as it had hitherto 
suffered from its vices. This suggests to me a fuller discussion of the 
origin of law and of

the methods by which we have arrived at the 
present endless multiplicity and variety of our statutes.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>Mankind in the earliest age lived for a time 
without a single vicious impulse, without shame or guilt, and, consequently, 
without punishment and restraints. Rewards were not needed when everything 
right was pursued on its own merits; and as men desired nothing against 
morality, they were debarred from nothing by fear. When however they began 
to throw off equality, and ambition and violence usurped the place of 
self-control and modesty, despotisms grew up and became perpetual among many 
nations. Some from the beginning, or when tired of kings, preferred codes of 
laws. These were at first simple, while men's minds were unsophisticated. 
The most famous of them were those of the <name type="ethnic">Cretans</name>, framed by <name type="person">Minos</name>; those of 
the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name>, by <name type="person">Lycurgus</name>, and, subsequently, those which <name type="person">Solan</name> drew up for 
the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> on a more elaborate and extensive scale. <name type="person">Romulus</name> governed us 
as he pleased; then <name type="person">Numa</name> united our people by religious ties and a 
constitution of divine origin, to which some additions were made by <name type="person">Tullus</name> 
and <name type="person">Ancus</name>. But <name type="person">Servius Tullius</name> was our chief legislator, to whose laws even 
kings were to be subject.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>After 
<name type="person">Tarquin</name>'s expulsion, the people, to check cabals among the Senators, devised 
many safeguards for freedom and for the establishment of unity. Decemvirs 
were appointed; everything specially admirable elsewhere was adopted, and 
the Twelve Tables drawn up, the last specimen of equitable legislation. For 
subsequent enactments, though occasionally directed against evildoers for 
some crime, were oftener carried by violence amid class dissensions, with a 
view to obtain honours not as yet conceded, or to banish distinguished 
citizens, or for other base ends. Hence the Gracchi and Saturnini, those 
popular agitators, and <name type="person">Drusus</name> too, as flagrant a corrupter in the Senate's 
name; hence, the bribing of our allies by alluring promises and the cheating 
them by tribunes vetoes. Even the Italian and then the Civil war did not 
pass without the enactment of many conflicting laws, till <name type="person">Lucius Sulla</name>, the 
Dictator, by the repeal or alteration of past legislation and by many 
additions, gave us a brief lull in this process, to be instantly

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DIGRESSION ON ROMAN CONSTITUTION</note>
followed by the 
seditious proposals of <name type="person">Lepidus</name>, and soon afterwards by the tribunes 
recovering their license to excite the people just as they chose. And now 
bills were passed, not only for national objects but for individual cases, 
and laws were most numerous when the commonwealth was most corrupt.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p><name type="person">Cneius Pompeius</name> was then for the third time 
elected consul to reform public morals, but in applying remedies more 
terrible than the evils and repealing the legislation of which he had 
himself been the author, he lost by arms what by arms he had been 
maintaining. Then followed twenty years of continuous strife; custom or law 
there was none; the vilest deeds went unpunished, while many noble acts 
brought ruin. At last, in his sixth consulship, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar Augustus</name>, 
feeling his power secure, annulled the decrees of his triumvirate, and gave 
us a constitution which might serve us in peace under a monarchy. Henceforth 
our chains became more galling, and spies were set over us, stimulated by 
rewards under the <name type="person">Papia Popp&aelig;a</name> law, so that if men shrank from the 
privileges of fatherhood, the State, as universal parent, might possess 
their ownerless properties. But this espionage became too searching, and <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> and Roman 
citizens everywhere fell into its clutches. Many men's fortunes were ruined, 
and over all there hung a terror, till <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, to provide a remedy, 
selected by lot five ex-consuls, five ex-pr&aelig;tors, and five senators, 
by whom most of the legal knots were disentangled and some slight temporary 
relief afforded.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>About this same time 
he commended to the Senate's favour, <name type="person">Nero</name>, <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s son, who was just 
entering on manhood, and asked them, not without smiles of ridicule from his 
audience, to exempt him from serving as one of the Twenty Commissioners, and 
let him be a candidate for the qu&aelig;storship five years earlier than the 
law allowed. His excuse was that a similar decree had been made for himself 
and his brother at the request of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. But I cannot doubt that even 
then there were some who secretly laughed at such a petition, though the 
C&aelig;sars were but in the beginning of their grandeur, and ancient usage 
was more constantly before men's eyes, while also the tie be-

tween stepfather and stepson was weaker than that between grandfather 
and grandchild. The pontificate was likewise conferred on <name type="person">Nero</name>, and on the 
day on which he first entered the forum, a gratuity was given to the 
city-populace, who greatly rejoiced at seeing a son of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> now grown 
to manhood. Their joy was further increased by <name type="person">Nero</name>'s marriage to <name type="person">Julia</name>, 
<name type="person">Drusus</name>'s daughter. This news was met with favourable comments, but it was 
heard with disgust that <name type="person">Sejanus</name> was to be the father-in-law of the son of 
<name type="person">Claudius</name>. The emperor was thought to have polluted the nobility of his house 
and to have yet further elevated <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, whom they already suspected of 
overweening ambition.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>Two remarkable 
men died at the end of the year, <name type="person">Lucius Volusius</name> and <name type="person">Sallustius Crispus</name>. 
<name type="person">Volusius</name> was of an old family, which had however never risen beyond the 
pr&aelig;torship. He brought into it the consulship; he also held the office 
of censor for arranging the classes of the knights, and was the first to 
pile up the wealth which that house enjoyed to a boundless extent. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">Crispus</name> was of equestrian descent and grandson of a sister of <name type="person">Caius 
Sallustius</name>, that most admirable Roman historian, by whom he was adopted and 
whose name he took. Though his road to preferment was easy, he chose to 
emulate <name type="person">M&aelig;cenas</name>, and without rising to a senator's rank, he surpassed 
in power many who had won triumphs and consulships. He was a contrast to the 
manners of antiquity in his elegance and refinement, and in the 
sumptuousness of his wealth he was almost a voluptuary. But beneath all this 
was a vigorous mind, equal to the greatest labours, the more active in 
proportion as he made a show of sloth and apathy. And so while <name type="person">M&aelig;cenas</name> 
lived, he stood next in favour to him, and was afterwards the chief 
depository of imperial secrets, and accessory to the murder of <name type="person">Postumus 
Agrippa</name>, till in advanced age he retained the shadow rather than the 
substance of the emperor's friendship. The same too had happened to 
<name type="person">M&aelig;cenas</name>, so rarely is it the destiny of power to be lasting, or 
perhaps a sense of weariness steals over princes when they have bestowed 
everything, or over favourites, when there is nothing left them to 
desire.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>Next followed <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s 
fourth, <name type="person">Drusus</name>'s second con-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TIBERIUS RETIRES TO <rs type="placename">CAMPANIA</rs></note>
sulship, memorable from the fact that 
father and son were colleagues. Two years previously the association of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> and <name type="person">Tiberius</name> in the same honour had not been agreeable to the 
uncle, nor had it the link of so close a natural tie. </p>
<p>At the beginning 
of this year <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, avowedly to recruit his health, retired to <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>, either as a gradual preparation for long and 
uninterrupted seclusion, or in order that <name type="person">Drusus</name> alone in his father's 
absence might discharge the duties of the consulship. It happened that a 
mere trifle which grew into a sharp contest gave the young prince the means, 
of acquiring popularity. <name type="person">Domitius Corbulo</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, complained to 
the Senate that <name type="person">Lucius Sulla</name>, a young noble, had not given place to him at a 
gladiatorial show. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> had age, national usage and the feelings of the 
older senators in his favour. Against him <name type="person">Mamercus Scaurus</name>, <name type="person">Lucius Arruntius</name> 
and other kinsmen of <name type="person">Sulla</name> strenuously exerted themselves. There was a keen 
debate, and appeal was made to the precedents of our ancestors, as having 
censured in severe decrees disrespect on the part of the young, till Drusus 
argued in a strain calculated to calm their feelings. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> too received 
an apology from <name type="person">Mamercus</name>, who was <name type="person">Sulla</name>'s uncle and stepfather, and the most 
fluent speaker of that day. </p>
<p>It was this same <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, who, after raising 
a cry that most of the roads in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> were 
obstructed or impassable through the dishonesty of contractors and the 
negligence of officials, himself willingly undertook the complete management 
of the business. This proved not so beneficial to the State as ruinous to 
many persons, whose property and credit he mercilessly attacked by 
convictions and confiscations.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>Soon 
afterwards <name type="person">Tiberius</name> informed the Senate by letter that <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> was again disturbed by an incursion of 
<name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>, and that they must use their judgment in choosing as pro-consul 
an experienced soldier of vigorous constitution, who would be equal to the 
war. <name type="person">Sextus Pompeius</name> caught at this opportunity of venting his hatred 
against <name type="person">Lepidus</name>, whom he condemned as a poor-spirited and needy man, who was 
a disgrace to his ancestors, and therefore deserved to lose even his chance 
of the province of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>. But the Senate were against 
him, for they thought <name type="person">Lepidus</name> gentle

rather than cowardly, and 
that his inherited poverty, with the high rank in which he had lived without 
a blot, ought to be considered a credit to him instead of a reproach. And so 
he was sent to <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, and with respect to <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> it was decided that the emperor should choose to 
whom it was to be assigned.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>During 
this debate <name type="person">Severus C&aelig;cina</name> proposed that no magistrate who had 
obtained a province should be accompanied by his wife. He began by 
recounting at length how harmoniously he had lived with his wife, who had 
borne him six children, and how in his own home he had observed what he was 
proposing for the public, by having kept her in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, though he had himself served forty campaigns in 
various provinces. "With good reason," he said, "had it been formerly 
decided that women were not to be taken among our allies or into foreign 
countries. A train of women involves delays through luxury in peace and 
through panic in war, and converts a Roman army on the march into the 
likeness of a barbarian progress. Not only is the sex feeble and unequal to 
hardship, but, when it has liberty, it is spiteful, intriguing and greedy of 
power. They show themselves off among the soldiers and have the centurions 
at their beck. Lately a woman had presided at the drill of the cohorts and 
the evolutions of the legions. You should yourselves bear in mind that, 
whenever men are accused of extortion, most of the charges are directed 
against the wives. It is to these that the vilest of the provincials 
instantly attach themselves; it is they who undertake and settle business; 
two persons receive homage when they appear; there are two centres of 
government, and the women's orders are the more despotic and intemperate. 
Formerly they were restrained by the Oppian and other laws; now, loosed from 
every bond, they rule our houses, our tribunals, even our armies."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>A few heard this speech with approval, but 
the majority clamorously objected that there was no proper motion on the 
subject, and that <name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name> was no fit censor on so grave an issue. 
Presently <name type="person">Valerius Messalinus</name>, <name type="person">Messala</name>'s son, in whom the father's eloquence 
was reproduced, replied that much of the sternness of antiquity had been 
changed into a better and more genial system. "<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>," he said, "is not

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">WIVES OF 
PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS </note>
now, as formerly, beset with wars, nor are the 
provinces hostile. A few concessions are made to the wants of women but such 
as are not even a burden to their husbands' homes, much less to the allies. 
In all other respects man and wife share alike, and this arrangement 
involves no trouble in peace. War of course requires that men should be 
unincumbered, but when they return what worthier solace can they have after 
their hardships than a wife's society? But some wives have abandoned 
themselves to scheming and rapacity. Well; even among our magistrates, are 
not many subject to various passions? Still, that is not a reason for 
sending no one into a province. Husbands have often been corrupted by the 
vices of their wives. Are then all unmarried men blameless? The Oppian laws 
were formerly adopted to meet the political necessities of the time, and 
subsequently there was some remission and mitigation of them on grounds of 
expediency. It is idle to shelter our own weakness under other names; for it 
is the husband's fault if the wife transgresses propriety. Besides, it is 
wrong that because of the imbecility of one or two men, all husbands should 
be cut off from their partners in prosperity and adversity. And further, a 
sex naturally weak will be thus left to itself and be at the mercy of its 
own voluptuousness and the passions of others. Even with the husband's 
personal vigilance the marriage tie is scarcely preserved inviolate. What 
would happen were it for a number of years to be forgotten, just as in a 
divorce? You must not check vices abroad without remembering the scandals of 
the capital." </p>
<p><name type="person">Drusus</name> added a few words on his own experience as a 
husband. "Princes," he said, "must often visit the extremities of their 
empire. How often had the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> travelled to the West and to the 
East accompanied by <name type="person">Livia</name>? He had himself gone to <rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs> and, should it be expedient, he would go to 
other countries, not always however with a contented mind, if he had to tear 
himself from a much loved wife, the mother of his many children."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p><name type="person">C&aelig;cina</name>'s motion was thus defeated. At 
the Senate's next meeting came a letter from <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, which indirectly 
censured them for throwing on the emperor every political care, and named 
<name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name> and <name type="person">Junius Bl&aelig;sus</name>, one

of whom was to be 
chosen pro-consul of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>. Both spoke on the 
subject, and <name type="person">Lepidus</name> begged earnestly to be excused. He alleged ill-health, 
his children's tender age, his having a daughter to marry, and something 
more of which he said nothing, was well understood, the fact that 
<name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> was uncle of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> and so had very powerful interest. 
<name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> replied with an affectation of refusal, but not with the same 
persistency, nor was he backed up by the acquiescence of flatterers.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>Next was exposed an abuse, hitherto the 
subject of many a whispered complaint. The vilest wretches used a growing 
freedom in exciting insult and obloquy against respectable citizens, and 
escaped punishment by clasping some statue of the emperor. The very freedman 
or slave was often an actual terror to his patron or master whom he would 
menace by word and gesture. Accordingly <name type="person">Caius Cestius</name>, a senator, argued 
that "though princes were like deities, yet even the gods listened only to 
righteous prayers from their suppliants, and that no one fled to the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs> 
or any other temple in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> to use it as an 
auxiliary in crime. There was an end and utter subversion of all law when, 
in the forum and on the threshold of the <rs type="placename">Senate-House</rs>, <name type="person">Annia Rufilla</name>, whom 
he had convicted of fraud before a judge, assailed him with insults and 
threats, while he did not himself dare to try legal proceedings, because he 
was confronted by her with the emperor's image." There rose other clamorous 
voices, with even more flagrant complaints, and all implored <name type="person">Drusus</name> to 
inflict exemplary vengeance, till he ordered <name type="person">Rufilla</name> to be summoned, and on 
her conviction to be confined in the common prison.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p><name type="person">Considius Aequus</name> too and <name type="person">C&oelig;lius Cursor</name>, Roman 
knights, were punished on the emperor's proposal, by a decree of the Senate, 
for having attacked the pr&aelig;tor, <name type="person">Magius C&aelig;cilianus</name>, with false 
charges of treason. Both these results were represented as an honour to 
<name type="person">Drusus</name>. By moving in society at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, amid popular 
talk, his father's dark policy it was thought, was mitigated. Even 
voluptuousness in one so young gave little offence. Better that he should 
incline that way, spend his days in architecture, his nights in banquets, 
than that he should live in solitude, cut off from every

pleasure, and 
absorbed in a gloomy vigilance and mischievous schemes.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> indeed and the informers were never weary. 
<name type="person">Ancharius Priscus</name> had prosecuted <name type="person">C&aelig;sius Cordus</name>, proconsul of <rs type="placename">Crete</rs>, for extortion, adding a charge of treason, which 
then crowned all indictments. <name type="person">Antistius Vetus</name>, one of the chief men of <rs type="placename">Macedonia</rs>, who had been acquitted of adultery, was 
recalled by the emperor himself, with a censure on the judges, to be tried 
for treason, as a seditious man who had been implicated in the designs of 
<name type="person">Rhescuporis</name>, when that king after the murder of his brother <name type="person">Cotys</name> had 
meditated war against us. The accused was accordingly outlawed, with the 
further sentence that he was to be confined in an island from which neither 
<rs type="placename">Macedonia</rs> nor <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs> were 
conveniently accessible. </p>
<p>As for <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs>, since 
the division of the kingdom between <name type="person">Rh&oelig;metalces</name> and the children of 
<name type="person">Cotys</name>, who because of their tender age were under the guardianship of 
<name type="person">Trebellienus Rufus</name>, it was divided against itself, from not being used to 
our rule, and blamed <name type="person">Rh&oelig;metalces</name> no less than <name type="person">Trebellienus</name> for 
allowing the wrongs of his countrymen to go unpunished. The <name type="ethnic">C&oelig;laletae</name>, 
<name type="ethnic">Odrusae</name> and <name type="ethnic">Dii</name>, powerful tribes, took up arms, under different leaders, all 
on a level from their obscurity. This hindered them from combining in a 
formidable war. Some roused their immediate neighbourhood; others crossed 
<rs type="placename">Mount H&aelig;mus</rs>, to stir up remote tribes; most of 
them, and the best disciplined, besieged the king in the city of <rs type="placename">Philippopolis</rs>, founded by the Macedonian <name type="person">Philip</name>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>When this was known to <name type="person">Publius Vell&aelig;us</name> 
who commanded the nearest army, he sent some allied cavalry and light 
infantry to attack those who were roaming in quest of plunder or of 
reinforcements, while he marched in person with the main strength of the 
foot to raise the siege. Every operation was at the same moment successful; 
the pillagers were cut to pieces; dissensions broke out among the besiegers, 
and the king made a well-timed sally just as the legion arrived. A battle or 
even a skirmish it did not deserve to be called, in which merely half-armed 
stragglers were slaughtered without bloodshed on our side.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>That same year, some states of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, under the pressure of heavy debts, attempted a 
revolt. Its most active instigators were <name type="person">Julius Florus</name> among the <name type="ethnic">Treveri</name> and 
<name type="person">Julius Sacrovir</name> among the <name type="ethnic">&AElig;dui</name>. Both could show noble birth and signal 
services rendered by ancestors, for which Roman citizenship had formerly 
been granted them, when the gift was rare and a recompense only of merit. In 
secret conferences to which the fiercest spirits were admitted, or any to 
whom poverty or the fear of guilt was an irresistible stimulus to crime, 
they arranged that <name type="person">Florus</name> was to rouse the <name type="ethnic">Belgae</name>, <name type="person">Sacrovir</name> the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> nearer 
home. These men accordingly talked sedition before small gatherings and 
popular assemblies about the perpetual tributes, the oppressive usury, the 
cruelty and arrogance of their governors, hinting too that there was 
disaffection among our soldiers, since they had heard of the murder of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>. "It was," they said, "a grand opportunity for the recovery of 
freedom, if only they would contrast their own vigour with the exhaustion of 
<rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, the unwarlike character of the city populace, 
and the utter weakness of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s armies in all but their foreign 
element."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>Scarcely a single community 
was untouched by the germs of this commotion. First however in actual revolt 
were the <name type="ethnic">Andecavi</name> and <name type="ethnic">Turoni</name>. Of these the former were put down by an 
officer, <name type="person">Acilius Aviola</name>, who had summoned a cohort which was on garrison 
duty at <rs type="placename">Lugdunum</rs>. The <name type="ethnic">Turoni</name> were quelled by some 
legionary troops sent by <name type="person">Visellius Varro</name> who commanded in <rs type="placename">Lower Germany</rs>, and led by the same <name type="person">Aviola</name> and some 
Gallic chieftains who brought aid, in order that they might disguise their 
disaffection and exhibit it at a better opportunity. <name type="person">Sacrovir</name> too was 
conspicuous, with head uncovered, cheering on his men to fight for <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, to display, as he said, his valour. But the 
prisoners asserted that he sought recognition that he might not be a mark 
for missiles. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> when consulted on the matter disdained the 
information, and fostered the war by his irresolution.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p><name type="person">Florus</name> meanwhile followed up his designs and tried 
to induce a squadron of cavalry levied among the <name type="ethnic">Treveri</name>, trained in our 
service and discipline, to begin hostilities by

IN <rs type="placename">GAUL</rs> CHECKED</note>
a massacre of the Roman 
traders. He corrupted a few of the men, but the majority were steadfast in 
their allegiance. A host however of debtors and dependents took up arms, and 
they were on their way to the forest passes known as the <rs type="placename">Arduenna</rs>, when they were stopped by legions which 
<name type="person">Visellius</name> and <name type="person">Silius</name> had sent from their respective armies, by opposite 
routes, to meet them. <name type="person">Julius Indus</name> from the same state, who was at feud with 
<name type="person">Florus</name> and therefore particularly eager to render us a service, was sent on 
in advance with a picked force, and dispersed the undisciplined rabble. 
<name type="person">Florus</name> after eluding the conquerors by hiding himself in one place after 
another, at last when he saw some soldiers who had barred every possible 
escape, fell by his own hand. Such was the end of the rebellion of the 
<name type="ethnic">Treveri</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>A more formidable movement 
broke out among the <name type="ethnic">&AElig;dui</name>, proportioned to the greater wealth of the 
state and the distance of the force which should repress it. <name type="person">Sacrovir</name> with 
some armed cohorts had made himself master of <rs type="placename">Augustodunum</rs>, the capital of the tribe, with the noblest 
youth of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, there devoting themselves to a 
liberal education, and with such hostages he proposed to unite in his cause 
their parents and kinsfolk. He also distributed among the youth arms which 
he had had secretly manufactured. There were forty thousand, one fifth armed 
like our legionaries; the rest had spears and knives and other weapons used 
in the chase. In addition were some slaves who were being trained for 
gladiators, clad after the national fashion in a complete covering of steel. 
They were called crupellarii, and though they were ill-adapted for 
inflicting wounds, they were impenetrable to them. This army was continually 
increased, not yet by any open combination of the neighbouring states, but 
by zealous individual enthusiasm, as well as by strife between the Roman 
generals, each of whom claimed the war for himself. <name type="person">Varro</name> after a while, as 
he was infirm and aged, yielded to <name type="person">Silius</name> who was in his prime.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile 
people said that it was not only the <name type="ethnic">Treveri</name> and <name type="ethnic">&AElig;dui</name> who had 
revolted, but sixty-four states of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs> with the 
<name type="ethnic">Germans</name> in alliance, while <rs type="placename">Spain</rs> too was 
disaffected; anything in fact was believed, with rumour's usual 
exaggeration. All good men were saddened by anxiety

for the 
country, but many in their loathing of the present system and eagerness for 
change, rejoiced at their very perils and exclaimed against <name type="person">Tiberius</name> for 
giving attention amid such political convulsions to the calumnies of 
informers. "Was <name type="person">Sacrovir</name> too," they asked, "to be charged with treason 
before the Senate? We have at last found men to check those murderous 
missives by the sword. Even war is a good exchange for a miserable peace." 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> all the more studiously assumed an air of unconcern. He changed 
neither his residence nor his look, but kept up his usual demeanour during 
the whole time, either from the profoundness of his reserve; or was it that 
he had convinced himself that the events were unimportant and much more 
insignificant than the rumours represented?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p><name type="person">Silius</name> meantime was advancing with two legions, and having sent 
forward some auxiliary troops was ravaging those villages of the <name type="ethnic">Sequani</name>, 
which, situated on the border, adjoin the <name type="ethnic">&AElig;dui</name>, and were associated 
with them in arms. He then pushed on by forced marches to <rs type="placename">Augustodunum</rs>, his standard-bearers vying in zeal, and 
even the privates loudly protesting against any halt for their usual rest or 
during the hours of night. "Only," they said, "let us have the foe face to 
face; that will be enough for victory." Twelve miles from <rs type="placename">Augustodunum</rs> they saw before them <name type="person">Sacrovir</name> and his army 
in an open plain. His men in armour he had posted in the van, his light 
infantry on the wings, and the half-armed in the rear. He himself rode amid 
the foremost ranks on a splendid charger, reminding them .of the ancient 
glories of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, of the disasters they had inflicted on the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, how 
grand would be the freedom of the victorious, how more intolerable than ever 
the slavery of a second conquest.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>His 
words were brief and heard without exultation. For now the legions in battle 
array were advancing, and the rabble of townsfolk who knew nothing of war 
had their faculties of sight and hearing quite paralysed. <name type="person">Silius</name>, on the one 
hand, though confident hope took away any need for encouragement, exclaimed 
again and again that it was a shame to the conquerors of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> to have to be led against <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, as against an 
enemy. "Only the other day

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AEDUAN INSURRECTION 
CRUSHED</note>
the rebel <name type="ethnic">Turoni</name> had been discomfited by a single cohort, the 
<name type="ethnic">Treveri</name> by one cavalry squadron, the <name type="ethnic">Sequani</name> by a few companies of this very 
army. Prove to these <name type="ethnic">&AElig;dui</name> once for all that the more they abound in 
wealth and luxury, the more unwarlike are they, but spare them when they 
flee."</p>
<p>Then there was a deafening cheer; the cavalry threw itself on the 
flanks, and the infantry charged the van. On the wings there was but a brief 
resistance. The men in mail were somewhat of an obstacle, as the iron plates 
did not yield to javelins or swords; but our men, snatching up hatchets and 
pickaxes, hacked at their bodies and their armour as if they were battering 
a wall. Some beat down the unwieldy mass with pikes and forked poles, and 
they were left lying on the ground, without an effort to rise, like dead 
men. <name type="person">Sacrovir</name> with his most trustworthy followers hurried first to <rs type="placename">Augustodunum</rs> and then, from fear of being surrendered, 
to an adjacent country house. There by his own hand he fell, and his 
comrades by mutually inflicted wounds. The house was fired over their heads, 
and with it they were all consumed.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>Then at last <name type="person">Tiberius</name> informed the Senate by letter of the beginning and 
completion of the war, without either taking away from or adding to the 
truth, but ascribing the success to the loyalty and courage of his generals, 
and to his own policy. He also gave the reasons why neither he himself nor 
<name type="person">Drusus</name> had gone to the war; he magnified the greatness of the empire, and 
said it would be undignified for emperors, whenever there was a commotion in 
one or two states, to quit the capital, the centre of all government. Now, 
as he was not influenced by fear, he would go to examine and settle matters. 
</p>
<p>The Senate decreed vows for his safe return, with thanksgivings and 
other appropriate ceremonies. <name type="person">Cornelius Dolabella</name> alone, in endeavouring to 
outdo the other Senators, went the length of a preposterous flattery by 
proposing that he should enter <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> from <rs type="placename">Campania</rs> with an ovation. Thereupon came a letter from 
the emperor, declaring that he was not so destitute of renown as after 
having subdued the most savage nations and received or refused so many 
triumphs in his youth, to covet now that he was old an un-

meaning honour for a tour in the neighbourhood of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>About the 
same time he requested the Senate to let the death of <name type="person">Sulpicius Quirinus</name> be 
celebrated with a public funeral. With the old patrician family of the 
Sulpicii this <name type="person">Quirinus</name>, who was born in the town of <rs type="placename">Lanuvium</rs>, was quite unconnected. An indefatigable 
soldier, he had by his zealous services won the consulship under the Divine 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, and subsequently the honours of a triumph for having stormed some 
fortresses of the Homonadenses in <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>. He was 
also appointed adviser to <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> in the government of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, and had likewise paid court to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, who 
was then at <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs>. The emperor now made all this 
known to the Senate, and extolled the good offices of <name type="person">Quirinus</name> to himself, 
while he censured <name type="person">Marcus Lolliu</name>s, whom he charged with encouraging <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;sar</name> in his perverse and quarrelsome behaviour. But people generally 
had no pleasure in the memory of <name type="person">Quirinus</name>, because of the perils he had 
brought, as I have related, on <name type="person">Lepida</name>, and the meanness and dangerous power 
of his last years.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>At the close of 
the year, <name type="person">Caius Lutorius Priscus</name>, a Roman knight, who, after writing a 
popular poem bewailing the death of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, had received a reward in 
money from the emperor, was fastened on by an informer, and charged with 
having composed another during the illness of <name type="person">Drusus</name>, which, in the event of 
the prince's death, might be published with even greater profit to himself. 
He had in his vanity read it in the house of <name type="person">Publius Petronius</name> before 
<name type="person">Vitellia</name>, <name type="person">Petronius</name>'s mother-in-law, and several ladies of rank. As soon as 
the accuser appeared, all but <name type="person">Vitellia</name> were frightened into giving evidence. 
She alone swore that she had heard not a word. But those who criminated him 
fatally were rather believed, and on the motion of <name type="person">Haterius Agrippa</name>, the 
consul-elect, the last penalty was invoked on the accused.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p><name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name> spoke against the sentence as 
follows:&mdash;"Senators, if we look to the single fact of the infamous 
utterance with which <name type="person">Lutorius</name> has polluted his own mind and the ears of the 
public, neither dungeon nor halter nor tortures fit for a slave would be 
punishment enough for him. But though vice and wicked deeds have no limit, 
penalties and correctives are moderated by the clemency of the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CONDEMNATION OF LUTORIUS PRISCUS</note>
sovereign and by the 
precedents of your ancestors and yourselves. Folly differs from wickedness; 
evil words from evil deeds, and thus there is room for a sentence by which 
this offence may not go unpunished, while we shall have no cause to regret 
either leniency or severity. Often have I heard our emperor complain when 
any one has anticipated his mercy by a self-inflicted death. <name type="person">Lutorius</name>'s life 
is still safe; if spared, he will be no danger to the State; if put to 
death, he will be no warning to others. His productions are as empty and 
ephemeral as they are replete with folly. Nothing serious or alarming is to 
be apprehended from the man who is the, betrayer of his own shame and works 
on the imaginations not of men but of silly women. However, let him leave 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, lose his property, and be outlawed. That is my 
proposal, just as though he were convicted under the law of treason."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>Only one of the ex-consuls, <name type="person">Rubellius 
Blandus</name>, supported <name type="person">Lepidus</name>. The rest voted with <name type="person">Agrippa</name>. <name type="person">Priscus</name> was dragged 
off to prison and instantly put to death. Of this <name type="person">Tiberius</name> complained to the 
Senate with his usual ambiguity, extolling their loyalty in so sharply 
avenging the very slightest insults to the sovereign, though he deprecated 
such hasty punishment of mere words, praising <name type="person">Lepidus</name> and not censuring 
<name type="person">Agrippa</name>. So the Senate passed a resolution that their decrees should not be 
registered in the treasury till nine days had expired, and so much respite 
was to be given to condemned persons. Still the Senate had not liberty to 
alter their purpose, and lapse of time never softened <name type="person">Tiberius</name>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p><name type="person">Caius Sulpicius</name> and <name type="person">Didius Haterius</name> were the 
next consuls. It was a year free from commotions abroad, while at home 
stringent legislation was apprehended against the luxury which had reached 
boundless excess in everything on which wealth is lavished. Some expenses, 
though very serious, were generally kept secret by a concealment of the real 
prices; but the costly preparations for gluttony and dissipation were the 
theme of incessant talk, and had suggested a fear that a prince who clung to 
old-fashioned frugality would be too stern in his reforms. In fact, when the 
&aelig;dile <name type="person">Caius Bibulus</name> broached the topic, all his colleagues had pointed 
out that the sumptuary laws were disregarded, that

prohibited 
prices for household articles were every day on the increase, and that 
moderate measures could not stop the evil. </p>
<p>The Senate on being consulted 
had, without handling the matter, referred it to the emperor. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
after long considering whether such reckless tastes could be repressed, 
whether the repression of them would not be still more hurtful to the State, 
also, how undignified it would be to meddle with what he could not succeed 
in, or what, if effected, would necessitate the disgrace and infamy of men 
of distinction, at last addressed a letter to the Senate to the following 
purport:&mdash;</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>Perhaps in any other 
matter, Senators, it would be more convenient that I should be consulted in 
your presence, and then state what I think to be for the public good. In 
this debate it was better that my eyes should not be on you, for while you 
were noting the anxious faces of individual senators charged with shameful 
luxury, I too myself might observe them and, as it were, detect them. Had 
those energetic men, our &aelig;diles, first taken counsel with me, I do not 
know whether I should not have advised them to let alone vices so strong and 
so matured, rather than merely attain the result of publishing what are the 
corruptions with which we cannot cope. They however have certainly done 
their duty, as I would wish all other officials likewise to fulfil their 
parts. For myself, it is neither seemly to keep silence nor is it easy to 
speak my mind, as I do not hold the office of &aelig;dile, pr&aelig;tor, or 
consul. Something greater and loftier is expected of a prince, and while 
everybody takes to himself the credit of right policy, one alone has to bear 
the odium of every person's failures. For what am I first to begin with 
restraining and cutting down to the old standard? The vast dimensions of 
country houses? The number of slaves of every nationality? The masses of 
silver and gold? The marvels in bronze and painting? The apparel worn 
indiscriminately by both sexes, or that peculiar luxury of women which, for 
the sake of jewels, diverts our wealth to strange or hostile nations?</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>I am not unaware that people at 
entertainments and social gatherings condemn all this and demand some 
restric-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">ROMAN LUXURY EXAMINED</note>
tion. But if a law 
were to be passed and a penalty imposed, those very same persons will cry 
out that the State is revolutionised, that ruin is plotted against all our 
most brilliant fashion, that not a citizen is safe from incrimination. Yet 
as even bodily disorders of long standing and growth can be checked only by 
sharp and painful treatment, so the fever of a diseased mind, itself 
polluted and a pollution to others, can be quenched only by remedies as 
strong as the passions which inflame it. Of the many laws devised by our 
ancestors, of the many passed by the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, the first have been 
forgotten, while his (all the more to our disgrace) have become obsolete 
through contempt, and this has made luxury bolder than ever. The truth is, 
that when one craves something not yet forbidden, there is a fear that it 
may be forbidden; but when people once transgress prohibitions with 
impunity, there is no longer any fear or any shame. </p>
<p>Why then in old 
times was economy in the ascendant? Because every one practised 
self-control; because we were all members of one city. Nor even afterwards 
had we the same temptations, while our dominion was confined to <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. Victories over the foreigner taught us how to 
waste the substance of others; victories over ourselves, how to squander our 
own. What a paltry matter is this of which the &aelig;diles are reminding 
us! What a mere trifle if you look at everything else! No one represents to 
the Senate that <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> requires supplies from abroad, 
and that the very existence of the people of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> is 
daily at the mercy of uncertain waves and storms. And unless masters, 
slaves, and estates have the resources of the provinces as their mainstay, 
our shrubberies, forsooth, and our country houses will have to support 
us.</p>
<p>Such, Senators, are the anxieties which the prince has to sustain, 
and the neglect of them will be utter ruin to the State. The cure for other 
evils must be sought in our own hearts. Let us be led to amendment, the poor 
by constraint, the rich by satiety. Or if any of our officials give promise 
of such energy and strictness as can stem the corruption, I praise the man, 
and I confess that I am relieved of a portion of my burdens. But if they 
wish to denounce vice, and when they have gained credit for so doing they 
arouse resentments and leave them to me, be assured, Senators, that I too 
am

by no means eager to incur enmities, and though for the public 
good I encounter formidable and often unjust enmities, yet I have a right to 
decline such as are unmeaning and purposeless and will be of use neither to 
myself nor to you.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>When they had 
heard the emperor's letter, the &aelig;diles were excused from so anxious a 
task, and that luxury of the table which from the close of the war ended at 
<rs type="placename">Actium</rs> to the armed revolution in which <name type="person">Servius 
Galba</name> rose to empire, had been practised with profuse expenditure, gradually 
went out of fashion. It is as well that I should trace the causes of this 
change. </p>
<p>Formerly rich or highly distinguished noble families often sank 
into ruin from a passion for splendour. Even then men were still at liberty 
to court and be courted by the city populace, by our allies and by foreign 
princes, and every one who from his wealth, his mansion and his 
establishment was conspicuously grand, gained too proportionate lustre by 
his name and his numerous <emph>client&egrave;le</emph>. After the savage 
massacres in which greatness of renown was fatal, the survivors turned to 
wiser ways. The new men who were often admitted into the Senate from the 
towns, colonies and even the provinces, introduced their household thrift, 
and though many of them by good luck or energy attained an old age of 
wealth, still their former tastes remained. But the chief encourager of 
strict manners was <name type="person">Vespasian</name>, himself old-fashioned both in his dress and 
diet. Henceforth a respectful feeling towards the prince and a love of 
emulation proved more efficacious than legal penalties or terrors. Or 
possibly there is in all things a kind of cycle, and there may be moral 
revolutions just as there are changes of seasons. Nor was everything better 
in the past, but our own age too has produced many specimens of excellence 
and culture for posterity to imitate. May we still keep up with our 
ancestors a rivalry in all that is honourable!</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> having gained credit for forbearance by the check he 
had given to the growing terror of the informers, wrote a letter to the 
Senate, requesting the tribunitian power for Drusus. This was a phrase which 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> devised as a designation of supremacy, so that without assuming 
the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DRUSUS INDICATED FOR SUCCESSION</note>
name of king or 
dictator he might have some title to mark his elevation above all other 
authority. He then chose <name type="person">Marcus Agrippa</name> to be his associate in this power, 
and on <name type="person">Agrippa</name>'s death, <name type="person">Tiberius Nero</name>, that there might be no uncertainty as 
to the succession. In this manner he thought to check the perverse ambition 
of others, while he had confidence in <name type="person">Nero</name>'s moderation and in his own 
greatness. </p>
<p>Following this precedent, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> now placed <name type="person">Drusus</name> next to 
the throne, though while <name type="person">Germanicus</name> was alive he had maintained an impartial 
attitude towards the two princes. However in the beginning of his letter he 
implored heaven to prosper his plans on behalf of the State, and then added 
a few remarks, without falsehood or exaggeration, on the character of the 
young prince. He had, he reminded them, a wife and three children, and his 
age was the same as that at which he had himself been formerly summoned by 
the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> to undertake this duty. Nor was it a precipitate step; 
it was only after an experience of eight years, after having quelled 
mutinies and settled wars, after a triumph and two consulships, that he was 
adopted as a partner in trials already familiar to him.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>The senators had anticipated this message and hence 
their flattery was the more elaborate. But they could devise nothing but 
voting statues of the two princes, shrines to certain deities, temples, 
arches and the usual routine, except that <name type="person">Marcus Silanus</name> sought to honour 
the princes by a slur on the consulate, and proposed that on all monuments, 
public or private, should be inscribed, to mark the date, the names, not of 
the consuls, but of those who were holding the tribunitian power. <name type="person">Quintus 
Haterius</name>, when he brought forward a motion that the decrees passed that day 
should be set up in the <rs type="placename">Senate House</rs> in letters of gold, was laughed at as 
an old dotard, who would get nothing but infamy out of such utterly 
loathsome sycophancy.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>Meantime <name type="person">Junius 
Bl&aelig;sus</name> received an extension of his government of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, and <name type="person">Servius Maluginensis</name>, the priest of <name type="person">Jupiter</name>, 
demanded to have <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> allotted to him. "It was," he 
asserted, "a popular error that it was not lawful for the priests of <name type="person">Jupiter</name> 
to leave <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>; in fact, his own legal position 
differed not from that of the priests of <name type="person">Mars</name> and of

<name type="person">Quirinus</name>. If 
these latter had provinces allotted to them, why was it forbidden to the 
priests of <name type="person">Jupiter</name>? There were no resolutions of the people or anything to 
be found in the books of ceremonies on the subject. Pontiffs had often 
performed the rites to <name type="person">Jupiter</name> when his priest was hindered by illness or by 
public duty. For seventy-five years after the suicide of <name type="person">Cornelius Merula</name> no 
successor to his office had been appointed; yet religious rites had not 
ceased. If during so many years it was possible for there to be no 
appointment without any prejudice to religion, with what comparative ease 
might he be absent for one year's proconsulate? That these priests in former 
days were prohibited by the pontiffs from going into the provinces, was the 
result of private feuds. Now, thank heaven, the supreme pontiff was also the 
supreme man, and was influenced by no rivalry, hatred or personal 
feeling."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>As the augur <name type="person">Lentulus</name> and 
others argued on various grounds against this view, the result was that they 
awaited the decision of the supreme pontiff. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> deferred any 
investigation into the priest's legal position, but he modified the 
ceremonies which had been decreed in honour of <name type="person">Drusus</name>'s tribunitian power 
with special censure on the extravagance of the proposed inscription in 
gold, so contrary to national usage. Letters also from <name type="person">Drusus</name> were read, 
which, though studiously modest in expression, were taken to be extremely 
supercilious. "We have fallen so low," people said, "that even a mere youth 
who has received so high an honour does not go as a worshipper to the city's 
gods, does not enter the Senate, does not so much as take the auspices on 
his country's soil. There is a war, forsooth, or he is kept from us in some 
remote part of the world. Why, at this very moment, he is on a tour amid the 
shores and lakes of <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>. Such is the training 
of the future ruler of mankind; such the lesson he first learns from his 
father's counsels. An aged emperor may indeed shrink from the citizen's 
gaze, and plead the weariness of declining years and the toils of the past. 
But, as for <name type="person">Drusus</name>, what can be his hindrance but pride?"</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> meantime, while securing to himself the 
substance of imperial power, allowed the Senate some shadow of

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">STATUS OF PRIESTS, OF SANCTUARIES</note>
its old constitution 
by referring to its investigation certain demands of the provinces. In the 
Greek cities license and impunity in establishing sanctuaries were on the 
increase. Temples were thronged with the vilest of the slaves; the same 
refuge screened the debtor against his creditor, as well as men suspected of 
capital offences. No authority was strong enough to check the turbulence of 
a people which protected the crimes of men as much as the worship of the 
gods. </p>
<p>It was accordingly decided that the different states were to send 
their charters and envoys to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Some voluntarily 
relinquished privileges which they had groundlessly usurped; many trusted to 
old superstitions, or to their services to the Roman people. It was a grand 
spectacle on that day, when the Senate examined grants made by our 
ancestors, treaties with allies, even decrees of kings who had flourished 
before <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s ascendancy, and the forms of worship of the very deities, with 
full liberty as in former days, to ratify or to alter.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>First of all came the people of <rs type="placename">Ephesus</rs>. They declared that <name type="person">Diana</name> and <name type="person">Apollo</name> were not 
born at <rs type="placename">Delos</rs>, as was the vulgar belief. They had in 
their own country a river <rs type="placename">Cenchrius</rs>, a grove 
<rs type="placename">Ortygia</rs>, where <name type="person">Latona</name>, as she leaned in the pangs of labour on an olive 
still standing, gave birth to those two deities, whereupon the grove at the 
divine intimation was consecrated. There <name type="person">Apollo</name> himself, after the slaughter 
of the <name type="person">Cyclops</name>, shunned the wrath of <name type="person">Jupiter</name>; there too father <name type="person">Bacchus</name>, when 
victorious in war, pardoned the suppliant <name type="ethnic">Amazons</name> who had gathered round the 
shrine. Subsequently by the permission of <name type="person">Hercules</name>, when he was subduing 
<rs type="placename">Lydia</rs>, the grandeur of the temple's ceremonial was augmented, and during the 
Persian rule its privileges were not curtailed. They had afterwards been 
maintained by the <name type="ethnic">Macedonians</name>, then by ourselves.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>Next the people of <rs type="placename">Magnesia</rs> relied on 
arrangements made by <name type="person">Lucius Scipio</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Sulla</name>. These generals, after 
respectively defeating <name type="person">Antiochus</name> and <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, honoured the fidelity and 
courage of the <name type="ethnic">Magnesians</name> by allowing the temple of <name type="person">Diana</name> of the White Brow 
to be an inviolable sanctuary. Then the people of <rs type="placename">Aphrodisia</rs> produced a decree of the dictator <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> 
for their old services to his

party, and those of <rs type="placename">Stratonicea</rs>, one lately passed by the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, 
in which they were commended for having endured the Parthian invasion 
without wavering in their loyalty to the Roman people. <rs type="placename">Aphrodisia</rs> maintained the worship of <name type="person">Venus</name>; <rs type="placename">Stratonicea</rs>, that of <name type="person">Jupiter</name> and of <name type="person">Diana</name> of the Cross 
Ways. </p>
<p><name type="person">Hieroc&aelig;sarea</name> went back to a higher antiquity, and spoke of 
having a Persian <name type="person">Diana</name>, whose fane was consecrated in the reign of <name type="person">Cyrus</name>. 
They quoted too the names of <name type="person">Perperna</name>, <name type="person">Isauricus</name>, and many other generals 
who had conceded the same sacred character not only to the temple but to its 
precincts for two miles. Then came the <name type="ethnic">Cyprians</name> on behalf of three shrines, 
the oldest of which had been set up by their founder <name type="person">A&euml;rias</name> to the 
Paphian <name type="person">Venus</name>, the second by his son <name type="person">Amathus</name> to <name type="person">Venus</name> of <rs type="placename">Amathus</rs>, and the last to <name type="person">Jupiter</name> of <rs type="placename">Salamis</rs>, by <name type="person">Teucer</name> when he fled from the wrath of his 
father <name type="person">Telamon</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>Audience was also 
given to embassies from other states. The senators wearied by their 
multiplicity and seeing the party spirit that was being roused, intrusted 
the inquiry to the consuls, who were to sift each title and see if it 
involved any abuse, and then refer back the entire matter to the Senate. 
Besides the states already mentioned, the consuls reported that they had 
ascertained that at <rs type="placename">Pergamus</rs> there was a sanctuary 
of <name type="person">&AElig;sculapius</name>, but that the rest relied on an origin lost in the 
obscurity of antiquity. For example, the people of <rs type="placename">Smyrna</rs> quoted an oracle of <name type="person">Apollo</name>, which had commanded 
them to dedicate a temple to <name type="person">Venus Stratonicis</name>; and the islanders of <rs type="placename">Tenos</rs>, an utterance from the same deity, bidding them 
consecrate a statue and a fane to <name type="person">Neptune</name>. <rs type="placename">Sardis</rs> 
preferred a more modern claim, a grant from the victorious <name type="person">Alexander</name>. So 
again <rs type="placename">Miletus</rs> relied on king <name type="person">Darius</name>. But in each 
case their religious worship was that of <name type="person">Diana</name> or <name type="person">Apollo</name>. The <name type="ethnic">Cretans</name> too 
demanded a like privilege for a statue of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>. Decrees of 
the Senate were passed, which though very respectful, still prescribed 
certain limits, and the petitioners were directed to set up bronze tablets 
in each temple, to be a sacred memorial and to restrain them from sinking 
into selfish aims under the mask of religion.</p></div2>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TEMPLE 
PRIVILEGES; SYCOPHANCY</note>
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>About this time 
<name type="person">Julia Augusta</name> had an alarming illness, which compelled the emperor to hasten 
his return to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, for hitherto there had been a 
genuine harmony between the mother and son, or a hatred well concealed. Not 
long before, for instance, <name type="person">Julia</name> in dedicating a statue to the Divine 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> near the theatre of <name type="person">Marcellus</name> had inscribed the name of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
below her own, and it was surmised that the emperor, regarding this as a 
slight on a sovereign's dignity, had brooded over it with deep and disguised 
resentment. However the Senate now decreed supplications to the gods and the 
celebration of the Great Games, which were to be exhibited by the pontiffs, 
augurs, the colleges of the Fifteen and of the Seven, with the Augustal 
Brotherhood. <name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name> moved that the heralds too should preside over 
these Games. This the emperor opposed, distinguishing the peculiar 
privileges of the sacred guilds, and quoting precedents. Never, he argued, 
had the heralds this dignity. "The Augustal priests were included expressly 
because their sacred office was specially attached to the family for which 
vows were being performed."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>My 
purpose is not to relate at length every motion, but only such as were 
conspicuous for excellence or notorious for infamy. This I regard as 
history's highest function, to let no worthy action be uncommemorated, and 
to hold out the reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words and 
deeds. So corrupted indeed and debased was that age by sycophancy that not 
only the foremost citizens who were forced to save their grandeur by 
servility, but every ex-consul, most of the ex-pr&aelig;tors and a host of 
inferior senators would rise in eager rivalry to propose shameful and 
preposterous motions. Tradition says that <name type="person">Tiberius</name> as often as he left the 
<rs type="placename">Senate-House</rs> used to exclaim in Greek, "How ready these men are to be 
slaves." Clearly, even he, with his dislike of public freedom, was disgusted 
at the abject abasement of his creatures.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>From unseemly flatteries they passed by degrees to savage acts. 
<name type="person">Caius Silanus</name>, pro-consul of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, was accused by 
our allies of extortion; whereupon <name type="person">Mamercus Scaurus</name>, an ex-consul, <name type="person">Junius

fastened on him and charged him with sacri-

lege to the divinity 
of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, and contempt of the majesty of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, while <name type="person">Mamercus Scaurus</name> 
quoted old precedents, the prosecutions of <name type="person">Lucius Cotta</name> by <name type="person">Scipio Africanus</name>, 
of <name type="person">Servius Galba</name> by <name type="person">Cato</name> the Censor and of <name type="person">Publius Rutilius</name> by <name type="person">Scaurus</name>. As

<name type="person">Mamercus</name> was now disgracing by his infamous occupation. <name type="person">Junius Otho</name>'s old 
employment had been the keeping of a preparatory school. Subsequently, 
becoming a senator by the influence of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, he shamed his origin, low as 
it was, by his unblushing effronteries. <name type="person">Brutidius</name> who was rich in excellent 
accomplishments, and was sure, had he pursued a path of virtue, to reach the 
most brilliant distinction, was goaded on by an eager impatience, while he 
strove to outstrip his equals, then his superiors, and at last even his own 
aspirations. Many have thus perished, even good men, despising slow and safe 
success and hurrying on even at the cost of ruin to premature 
greatness.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p><name type="person">Gellius Publicola</name> and 
<name type="person">Marcus Paconius</name>, respectively qu&aelig;stor and lieutenant of <name type="person">Silanus</name>, 
swelled the number of the accusers. No doubt was felt as to the defendant's 
conviction for oppression and extortion, but there was a combination against 
him, that must have been perilous even to an innocent man. Besides a host of 
adverse Senators there were the most accomplished orators of all <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, who, as such, had been retained for the 
prosecution, and to these he had to reply alone, without any experience in 
pleading, and under that personal apprehension which is enough to paralyse 
even the most practised eloquence. For <name type="person">Tiberius</name> did not refrain from 
pressing him with angry voice and look, himself putting incessant questions, 
without allowing him to rebut or evade them, and he had often even to make 
admissions, that the questions might not have been asked in vain. His slaves 
too were sold by auction to the state-agent, to be examined by torture. And 
that not a friend might help him in his danger, charges of treason were 
added, a binding guarantee for sealed lips. Accordingly he begged a few 
days' respite, and at last abandoned his defence, after venturing

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROSECUTION OF SILANUS</note>
on a memorial to the emperor, in 
which he mingled reproach and entreaty.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name>, that his proceedings against <name type="person">Silanus</name> might find some 
justification in precedent, ordered the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>'s indictment of 
<name type="person">Volesus Messala</name>, also a proconsul of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, and the 
Senate's sentence on him to be read. He then asked <name type="person">Lucius Piso</name> his opinion. 
After a long preliminary eulogy on the prince's clemency, <name type="person">Piso</name> pronounced 
that <name type="person">Silanus</name> ought to be outlawed and banished to the island of <rs type="placename">Gyarus</rs>. The rest concurred, with the exception of <name type="person">Cneius 
Lentulus</name>, who, with the assent of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, proposed that the property of 
<name type="person">Silanus</name>'s mother, as she was very different from him, should be exempted 
from confiscation, and given to the son.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p><name type="person">Cornelius Dolabella</name> however, by way of carrying flattery yet 
further, sharply censured the morals of <name type="person">Silanus</name>, and then moved that no one 
of disgraceful life and notorious infamy should be eligible for a province, 
and that of this the emperor should be judge. "Laws, indeed," he said, 
"punish crimes committed; but how much more merciful would it be to 
individuals, how much better for our allies, to provide against their 
commission." </p>
<p>The emperor opposed the motion. "Although," he said, "I am 
not ignorant of the reports about <name type="person">Silanus</name>, still we must decide nothing by 
hearsay. Many a man has behaved in a province quite otherwise than was hoped 
or feared of him. Some are roused to higher things by great responsibility; 
others are paralysed by it. It is not possible for a prince's knowledge to 
embrace everything, and it is not expedient that he should be exposed to the 
ambitious schemings of others. Laws are ordained to meet facts, inasmuch as 
the future is uncertain. It was the rule of our ancestors that, whenever 
there was first an offence, some penalty should follow. Let us not 
revolutionise a wisely devised and ever approved system. Princes have enough 
burdens, and also enough power. Rights are invariably abridged, as despotism 
increases; nor ought we to fall back on imperial authority, when we can have 
recourse to the laws." </p>
<p>Such constitutional sentiments were so rare with 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, that they were welcomed with all the heartier joy. Know-

ing, as he did, how to be forbearing, when he was not under the 
stimulus of personal resentment, he further said that <rs type="placename">Gyarus</rs> was a dreary and uninhabited island, and that, as 
a concession to the Junian family and to a man of the same order as 
themselves, they might let him retire by preference to <rs type="placename">Cythnus</rs>. This, he 
added, was also the request of <name type="person">Torquata</name>, <name type="person">Silanus</name>'s sister, a vestal of 
primitive purity. The motion was carried after a division.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p>Audience was next given to the people of <rs type="placename">Cyrene</rs>, and on the prosecution of <name type="person">Ancharius Priscus</name>, 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sius Cordus</name> was convicted of extortion. <name type="person">Lucius Ennius</name>, a Roman 
knight, was accused of treason, for having converted a statue of the emperor 
to the common use of silver plate; but the emperor forbade his being put 
upon his trial, though <name type="person">Ateius Capito</name> openly remonstrated, with a show of 
independence. "The Senate," he said, "ought not to have wrested from it the 
power of deciding a question, and such a crime must not go unpunished. 
Granted that the emperor might be indifferent to a personal grievance, still 
he should not be generous in the case of wrongs to the commonwealth." 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> interpreted the remark according to its drift rather than its mere 
expression, and persisted in his veto. <name type="person">Capito</name>'s disgrace was the more 
conspicuous, for, versed as he was in the science of law, human and divine, 
he had now dishonoured a brilliant public career as well as a virtuous 
private life.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>Next came a religious 
question, as to the temple in which ought to be deposited the offering which 
the Roman knights had vowed to Fortune of the Knights for the recovery of 
<name type="person">Augusta</name>. Although that Goddess had several shrines in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, there was none with this special designation. It 
was ascertained that there was a temple so called at <rs type="placename">Antium</rs>, and that all sacred rites in the towns of <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> as well as temples and images of deities were 
under the jurisdiction and authority of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. 
Accordingly the offering was placed at <rs type="placename">Antium</rs>. 
</p>
<p>As religious questions were under discussion, the emperor now produced 
his answer to <name type="person">Servius Maluginensis</name>, <name type="person">Jupiter</name>'s priest, which he had recently 
deferred, and read the pontifical decree, prescribing that whenever illness 
attacked a priest of <name type="person">Jupiter</name>, he might, with the supreme pontiff's permission,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">BUILDINGS RESTORED</note>
be absent more than 
two nights, provided it was not during the days of public sacrifice or more 
than twice in the same year. This regulation of the emperor <name type="person">Augustus</name> 
sufficiently proved that a year's absence and a provincial government were 
not permitted to the priests of <name type="person">Jupiter</name>. There was also cited the precedent 
of <name type="person">Lucius Metellus</name>, supreme pontiff, who had detained at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> the priest <name type="person">Aulus Postumius</name>. And so <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> was allotted to the ex-consul next in seniority to 
<name type="person">Maluginensis</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>About the same time 
<name type="person">Lepidus</name> asked the Senate's leave to restore and embellish, at his own 
expense, the <rs type="placename">basilica of Paulus</rs>, that monument of the &AElig;milian family. 
Public-spirited munificence was still in fashion, and <name type="person">Augustus</name> had not 
hindered <name type="person">Taurus</name>, <name type="person">Philippus</name>, or <name type="person">Balbus</name> from applying the spoils of war or 
their superfluous wealth to adorn the capital and to win the admiration of 
posterity. Following these examples, <name type="person">Lepidus</name>, though possessed of a moderate 
fortune, now revived the glory of his ancestors. </p>
<p><rs type="placename">Pompeius's theatre</rs>, 
which had been destroyed by an accidental fire, the emperor promised to 
rebuild, simply because no member of the family was equal to restoring it, 
but <name type="person">Pompeius</name>'s name was to be retained. At the same time he highly extolled 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name> on the ground that it was through his exertions and vigilance that 
such fury of the flames had been confined to the destruction of a single 
building. The Senate voted <name type="person">Sejanus</name> a statue, which was to be placed in 
<rs type="placename">Pompeius's theatre</rs>. And soon afterwards the emperor in honouring <name type="person">Junius 
Bl&aelig;sus</name>, proconsul of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, with triumphal 
distinctions, said that he granted them as a compliment to <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, whose 
uncle <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> was.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>Still the 
career of <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> merited such a reward. For <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>, through often 
driven back, had recruited his resources in the interior of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, and had become so insolent as to send envoys to 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, actually demanding a settlement for himself and his army, or else 
threatening us with an interminable war. Never, it is said, was the emperor 
so exasperated by an insult to himself and the Roman people as by a deserter 
and brigand assuming the character of a belligerent. "Even <name type="person">Spartacus</name> when he 
had destroyed so many consular armies and was burning <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> with impunity,

though the State was 
staggering under the tremendous wars of <name type="person">Sertorius</name> and <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, had not 
the offer of an honourable surrender on stipulated conditions; far less, in 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s most glorious height of power, should a robber like <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> be 
bought off by peace and concessions of territory." He intrusted the affair 
to <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>, who was to hold out to the other rebels the prospect of 
laying down their arms without hurt to themselves, while he was by any means 
to secure the person of the chief. Many surrendered themselves on the 
strength of this amnesty. Before long the tactics of <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> were 
encountered in a similar fashion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>Unequal to us in solid military strength, but better in a war of surprises, 
he would attack, would elude pursuit, and still arrange ambuscades with a 
multitude of detachments. And so we prepared three expeditions and as many 
columns. One of the three under the command of <name type="person">Cornelius Scipio</name>, 
<name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>'s lieutenant, was to stop the enemy's forays on the <name type="ethnic">Leptitani</name> 
and his retreat to the <name type="ethnic">Garamantes</name>. In another quarter, <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>'s son 
led a separate force of his own, to save the villages of <rs type="placename">Cirta</rs> from being ravaged with impunity. Between the two 
was the general himself with some picked troops. By establishing redoubts 
and fortified lines in commanding positions, he had rendered the whole 
country embarrassing and perilous to the foe, for, whichever way he turned, 
a body of Roman soldiers was in his face, or on his flank, or frequently in 
the rear. Many were thus slain or surprised. </p>
<p><name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> then further 
divided his triple army into several detachments under the command of 
centurions of tried valour. At the end of the summer he did not, as was 
usual, withdraw his troops and let them rest in winter-quarters in the old 
province; but, forming a chain of forts, as though he were on the threshold 
of a campaign, he drove <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> by flying columns well acquainted with 
the desert, from one set of huts to another, till he captured the chief's 
brother, and then returned, too soon however for the welfare of our allies, 
as there yet remained those who might renew hostilities. </p>
<p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
however considered the war as finished, and awarded <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> the further 
distinction of being hailed "Imperator" by the legions, an ancient honour 
conferred on gen-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">BL&AElig;SUS DEFEATS

erals who for good service to the State were saluted with 
cheers of joyful enthusiasm by a victorious army. Several men bore the title 
at the same time, without pre-eminence above their fellows. <name type="person">Augustus</name> too 
granted the name to certain persons; and now, for the last time, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
gave it to <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p>Two 
illustrious men died that year. One was <name type="person">Asinius Saloninus</name>, distinguished as 
the grandson of <name type="person">Marcus Agrippa</name>, and <name type="person">Asinius Pollio</name>, as the brother of <name type="person">Drusus</name> 
and the intended husband of the emperor's granddaughter. The other was 
<name type="person">Capito Ateius</name>, already mentioned, who had won a foremost position in the 
State by his legal attainments, though his grandfather was but a centurion 
in <name type="person">Sulla</name>'s army, his father having been a pr&aelig;tor. He was prematurely 
advanced to the consulship by <name type="person">Augustus</name>, so that he might be raised by the 
honour of this promotion above <name type="person">Labeo Antistius</name>, a conspicuous member of the 
same profession. That age indeed produced at one time two brilliant 
ornaments of peace. But while <name type="person">Labeo</name> was a man of sturdy independence and 
consequently of wider fame, <name type="person">Capito</name>'s obsequiousness was more acceptable to 
those in power. <name type="person">Labeo</name>, because his promotion was confined to the 
pr&aelig;torship, gained in public favour through the wrong; <name type="person">Capito</name>, in 
obtaining the consulship, incurred the hatred which grows out of 
envy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="76"><p><name type="person">Junia</name> too, the niece of <name type="person">Cato</name>,

sixty-fourth after the battle of <rs type="placename">Philippi</rs>. Her will was the theme of much 
popular criticism, for, with her vast wealth, after having honourably 
mentioned almost every nobleman by name, she passed over the emperor. 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> took the omission graciously, and did not forbid a panegyric before 
the <rs type="placename">Rostra</rs> with the other customary funeral honours. The busts of twenty 
most illustrious families were borne in the procession, with the names of 
<name type="person">Manlius</name>, <name type="person">Quinctius</name>, and others of equal rank. But <name type="person">Cassius</name> and <name type="person">Brutus</name> 
outshone them all, from the very fact that their likenesses were not to be 
seen.</p></div2></div1>

<head>BOOK IV</head>
<head><dateRange from="23" to="28">A.D. 23&mdash;28</dateRange></head> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>THE year when <name type="person">Caius Asinius</name> and <name type="person">Caius Antistius</name> were consuls was 
the ninth of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s reign, a period of tranquillity for the State and 
prosperity for his own house, for he counted <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s death a happy 
incident. Suddenly fortune deranged everything; the emperor became a cruel 
tyrant, as well as an abettor of cruelty in others. Of this the cause and 
origin was <name type="person">&AElig;lius Sejanus</name>, commander of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts, of 
whose influence I have already spoken. I will now fully describe his 
extraction, his character, and the daring wickedness by which he grasped at 
power. </p>
<p>Born at <rs type="placename">Vulsinii</rs>, the son of <name type="person">Seius 
Strabo</name>, a Roman knight, he attached himself in his early youth to <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;sar</name>, grandson of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, and the story went that he had 
sold his person to <name type="person">Apicius</name>, a rich debauchee. Soon afterwards he won the 
heart of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> so effectually by various artifices that the emperor, ever 
dark and mysterious towards others, was with <name type="person">Sejanus</name> alone careless and 
freespoken. It was not through his craft, for it was by this very weapon 
that he was overthrown; it was rather from heaven's wrath against <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, to whose welfare his elevation and his fall were 
alike disastrous. He had a body which could endure hardships, and a daring 
spirit. He was one who screened himself, while he was attacking others; he 
was as cringing as he was imperious; before the world he affected humility; 
in his heart he lusted after supremacy, for the sake of which he was 
sometimes lavish and luxurious, but oftener energetic and watchful, 
qualities quite as mischievous when hypocritically assumed for the 
attainment of sovereignty.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>He 
strengthened the hitherto moderate powers of his office by concentrating the 
cohorts scattered throughout the capital into one camp, so that they might 
all receive orders

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SEJANUS' POSITION AND 
AMBITIONS</note>
at the same moment, and that the sight of their numbers and 
strength might give confidence to themselves, while it would strike terror 
into the citizens. His pretexts were the demoralisation incident to a 
dispersed soldiery, the greater effectiveness of simultaneous action in the 
event of a sudden peril, and the stricter discipline which would be insured 
by the establishment of an encampment at a distance from the temptations of 
the city. As soon as the camp was completed, he crept gradually into the 
affections of the soldiers by mixing with them and addressing them by name, 
himself selecting the centurions and tribunes. With the Senate too he sought 
to ingratiate himself, distinguishing his partisans with offices and 
provinces, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> readily yielding, and being so biassed that not only in 
private conversation but before the senators and the people he spoke highly 
of him as the partner of his toils, and allowed his statues to be honoured 
in theatres, in forums, and at the head-quarters of our legions.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>There were however obstacles to his ambition 
in the imperial house with its many princes, a son in youthful manhood and 
grown-up grandsons. As it would be unsafe to sweep off such a number at once 
by violence, while craft would necessitate successive intervals in crime, he 
chose, on the whole, the stealthier way, and to begin with <name type="person">Drusus</name>, against 
whom he had the stimulus of a recent resentment. <name type="person">Drusus</name>, who could not brook 
a rival and was somewhat irascible, had, in a casual dispute, raised his 
fist at <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, and, when he defended himself, had struck him in the face. 
On considering every plan, <name type="person">Sejanus</name> thought his easiest revenge was to turn 
his attention to <name type="person">Livia</name>, <name type="person">Drusus</name>'s wife. She was a sister of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, and 
though she was not handsome as a girl, she became a woman of surpassing 
beauty. Pretending an ardent passion for her, he seduced her, and having won 
his first infamous triumph, and assured that a woman after having parted 
with her virtue will hesitate at nothing, he lured her on to thoughts of 
marriage, of a share in sovereignty, and of her husband's destruction. And 
she, the niece of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, the daughter-in-law of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, the mother of 
children by <name type="person">Drusus</name>, for a provincial paramour, foully disgraced herself, her 
ancestors, and her descendants,

giving up honour and a sure 
position for prospects as base as they were uncertain. They took into their 
confidence <name type="person">Eudemus</name>, <name type="person">Livia</name>'s friend and physician, whose profession was a 
pretext for frequent secret interviews. <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, to avert his mistress's 
jealousy, divorced his wife <name type="person">Apicata</name>, by whom he had had three children. 
Still the magnitude of the crime caused fear and delay, and sometimes a 
conflict of plans.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>Meanwhile, at the 
beginning of this year, <name type="person">Drusus</name>, one of the children of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, assumed 
the dress of manhood, with a repetition of the honours decreed by the Senate 
to his brother <name type="person">Nero</name>. The emperor added a speech, with warm praise of his son 
for sharing a father's affection to his brother's children. <name type="person">Drusus</name> indeed, 
difficult as it is for power and mutual harmony to exist side by side, had 
the character of being kindly disposed or at least not unfriendly towards 
the lads. And now the old plan, so often insincerely broached, of a progress 
through the provinces, was again discussed. The emperor's pretext was the 
number of veterans on the eve of discharge and the necessity of fresh levies 
for the army. Volunteers were not forthcoming, and even if they were 
sufficiently numerous, they had not the same bravery and discipline, as it 
is chiefly the needy and the homeless who adopt by their own choice a 
soldier's life. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> also rapidly enumerated the legions and the 
provinces which they had to garrison. I too ought, I think, to go through 
these details, and thus show what forces <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> then 
had under arms, what kings were our allies, and how much narrower then were 
the limits of our empire.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p><rs type="placename">Italy</rs> on both seas was guarded by fleets, at <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs> and at <rs type="placename">Ravenna</rs>, and the 
contiguous coast of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs> by ships of war captured in 
the victory of <rs type="placename">Actium</rs>, and sent by <name type="person">Augustus</name> 
powerfully manned to the town of <rs type="placename">Forojulium</rs>. But our 
chief strength was on the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, as a defence alike 
against <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> and <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, and numbered eight legions. <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>, lately subjugated, was held by three. <rs type="placename">Mauretania</rs> was king <name type="person">Juba</name>'s, who had received it as a 
gift from the Roman people. The rest of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> was 
garrisoned by two legions, and <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> by the same 
number. Next, beginning with <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, all within the 
entire tract of country stretching as far as the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, was kept in restraint by four legions, and on 
this

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DEFENCES OF THE EMPIRE</note>
frontier were <name type="ethnic">Iberian</name>, 
<name type="ethnic">Albanian</name>, and other kings, to whom our greatness was a protection against 
any foreign power. <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs> was held by 
<name type="person">Rh&oelig;metalces</name> and the children of <name type="person">Cotys</name>; the bank of the <rs type="placename">Danube</rs> by two legions in <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs>, two in <rs type="placename">M&oelig;sia</rs>, 
and two also were stationed in <rs type="placename">Dalmatia</rs>, which, from the situation of the 
country, were in the rear of the other four, and, should <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> suddenly require aid, not too distant to be 
summoned. But the capital was garrisoned by its own special soldiery, three 
city, nine pr&aelig;torian cohorts, levied for the most part in <rs type="placename">Etruria</rs> and <rs type="placename">Umbria</rs>, or ancient 
<rs type="placename">Latium</rs> and the old Roman colonies. There were besides, in commanding 
positions in the provinces, allied fleets, cavalry and light infantry, of 
but little inferior strength. But any detailed account of them would be 
misleading, since they moved from place to place as circumstances required, 
and had their numbers increased and sometimes diminished.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>It is however, I think, a convenient opportunity for 
me to review the hitherto prevailing methods of administration in the other 
departments of the State, inasmuch as that year brought with it the 
beginning of a change for the worse in <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s policy. In the first 
place, public business and the most important private matters were managed 
by the Senate: the leading men were allowed freedom of discussion, and when 
they stooped to flattery, the emperor himself checked them. He bestowed 
honours with regard to noble ancestry, military renown, or brilliant 
accomplishments as a civilian, letting it be clearly seen that there were no 
better men to choose. The consul and the pr&aelig;tor retained their 
prestige; inferior magistrates exercised their authority; the laws too, with 
the single exception of cases of treason, were properly enforced. </p>
<p>As to 
the duties on corn, the indirect taxes and other branches of the public 
revenue, they were in the hands of companies of Roman knights. The emperor 
intrusted his own property to men of the most tried integrity or to persons 
known only by their general reputation, and once appointed they were 
retained without any limitation, so that most of them grew old in the same 
employments. The city populace indeed suffered much from high prices, but 
this was no fault of the emperor, who actually endeavoured to counteract 
bar-

ren soils and stormy seas with every resource of wealth and 
foresight. And he was also careful not to distress the provinces by new 
burdens, and to see that in bearing the old they were safe from any rapacity 
or oppression on the part of governors. Corporal punishments and 
confiscations of property were unknown.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>The emperor had only a few estates in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, slaves 
on a moderate scale, and his household was confined to a few freedmen. If 
ever he had a dispute with a private person, it was decided in the law 
courts. All this, not indeed with any graciousness, but in a blunt fashion 
which often alarmed, he still kept up, until the death of <name type="person">Drusus</name> changed 
everything. While he lived, the system continued, because <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, as yet 
only in the beginning of his power, wished to be known as an upright 
counsellor, and there was one whose vengeance he dreaded, who did not 
conceal his hatred and incessantly complained "that a stranger was invited 
to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive. How near was 
the step of declaring the stranger a colleague? Ambition at first had a 
steep path before it; when once the way had been entered, zealous adherents 
were forthcoming. Already, at the pleasure of the commander of the guards, a 
camp had been established; the soldiers were given into his hands; his 
statues were to be seen among the monuments of <name type="person">Cneius Pompeius</name>; his 
grandsons would be of the same blood as the family of the Drusi. Henceforth 
they must pray that he might have self-control, and so be contented." So 
would <name type="person">Drusus</name> talk, not unfrequently, or only in the hearing of a few 
persons. Even his confidences, now that his wife had been corrupted, were 
betrayed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p><name type="person">Sejanus</name> accordingly thought 
that he must be prompt, and chose a poison the gradual working of which 
might be mistaken for a natural disorder. It was given to <name type="person">Drusus</name> by <name type="person">Lygdus</name>, 
a eunuch, as was ascertained eight years later. As for <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, he went to 
the <rs type="placename">Senate house</rs> during the whole time of the prince's illness, either 
because he was not afraid, or to show his strength of mind, and even in the 
interval between his death and funeral. Seeing the consuls, in token of 
their grief, sitting on the ordinary benches, he reminded them of their high 
office and of their proper place; and when

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CIVIL 
ADMINISTRATION; DRUSUS POISONED</note>
the Senate burst into tears, 
suppressing a groan, he revived their spirits with a fluent speech. "He knew 
indeed that he might be reproached for thus encountering the gaze of the 
Senate after so recent an affliction. Most mourners could hardly bear even 
the soothing words of kinsfolk or to look on the light of day. And such were 
not to be condemned as weak. But he had sought a more manly consolation in 
the bosom of the commonwealth." </p>
<p>Then deploring the extreme age of 
<name type="person">Augusta</name>, the childhood of his grandsons, and his own declining years, he 
begged the Senate to summon <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s children, the only comfort under 
their present misery. The consuls went out, and having encouraged the young 
princes with kind words, brought them in and presented them to the emperor. 
Taking them by the hand he said: "Senators, when these boys lost their 
father, I committed them to their uncle, and begged him, though he had 
children of his own, to cherish and rear them as his own offspring, and 
train them for himself and for posterity. <name type="person">Drusus</name> is now lost to us, and I 
turn my prayers to you, and before heaven and your country I adjure you to 
receive into your care and guidance the great-grandsons of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, 
descendants of a most noble ancestry. So fulfil your duty and mine. To you, 
<name type="person">Nero</name> and <name type="person">Drusus</name>, these senators are as fathers. Such is your birth that your 
prosperity and adversity must alike affect the State."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>There was great weeping at these words, and then many 
a benediction. Had the emperor set bounds to his speech, he must have filled 
the hearts of his hearers with sympathy and admiration. But he now fell back 
on those idle and often ridiculed professions about restoring the republic, 
and the wish that the consuls or some one else might undertake the 
government, and thus destroyed belief even in what was genuine and 
noble.</p>
<p>The same honours were decreed to the memory of <name type="person">Drusus</name> as to that 
of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, and many more were added. Such is the way with flattery, when 
repeated. The funeral with its procession of statues was singularly grand. 
<name type="person">Aeneas</name>, the father of the <placeName key="tgn,2089671">Julian</placeName> house, all the <placeName key="tgn,2127955">Alban</placeName> kings, <name type="person">Romulus</name>, <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s 
founder, then the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> nobility, <name type="person">Attus Clausus</name>, and

the busts 
of all the other Claudii were displayed in a long train.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>In relating the death of <name type="person">Drusus</name> I have followed the 
narrative of most of the best historians. But I would not pass over a rumour 
of the time, the strength of which is not even yet exhausted. <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, it is 
said, having seduced <name type="person">Livia</name> into crime, next secured, by the foulest means, 
the consent of <name type="person">Lygdus</name>, the eunuch, as from his youth and beauty he was his 
master's favourite, and one of his principal attendants. When those who were 
in the secret had decided on the time and place of the poisoning, <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, 
with the most consummate daring, reversed his plan, and, whispering an 
accusation against <name type="person">Drusus</name> of intending to poison his father, warned <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
to avoid the first draught offered him as he was dining at his son's house. 
Thus deceived, the old emperor, on sitting down to the banquet, took the cup 
and handed it to <name type="person">Drusus</name>. His suspicions were increased when <name type="person">Drusus</name>, in 
perfect unconsciousness, drank it off with youthful eagerness, apparently, 
out of fear and shame, bringing on himself the death which he had plotted 
against his father.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>These popular 
rumours, over and above the fact that they are not vouched for by any good 
writer, may be instantly refuted. For who, with moderate prudence, far less 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> with his great experience, would have thrust destruction on a son, 
without even hearing him, with his own hand too, and with an impossibility 
of returning to better thoughts. Surely he would rather have had the slave 
who handed the poison, tortured, have sought to discover the traitor, in 
short, would have been as hesitating and tardy in the case of an only son 
hitherto unconvicted of any crime, as he was naturally even with strangers. 
But as <name type="person">Sejanus</name> had the credit of contriving every sort of wickedness, the 
fact that he was the emperor's special favourite, and that both were hated 
by the rest of the world, procured belief for any monstrous fiction, and 
rumour too always has a dreadful side in regard to the deaths of men in 
power. Besides, the whole process of the crime was betrayed by <name type="person">Apicata</name>, 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name>'s wife, and fully divulged, under torture, by <name type="person">Eudemus</name> and <name type="person">Lygdus</name>. No 
writer has been found sufficiently malignant to fix the guilt on <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
though every circumstance was

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">RUMORS REGARDING 
DRUSUS</note>
scrutinized and exaggerated. My object in mentioning and 
refuting this story is, by a conspicuous example, to put down hearsay, and 
to request all into whose hands my work shall come, not to catch eagerly at 
wild and improbable rumours in preference to genuine history which has not 
been perverted into romance.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
pronounced a panegyric on his son before the <rs type="placename">Rostra</rs>, during which the Senate 
and people, in appearance rather than in heart, put on the expression and 
accents of sorrow, while they inwardly rejoiced at the brightening future of 
the family of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. This beginning of popularity and the ill-concealed 
ambition of their mother <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, hastened its downfall. <name type="person">Sejanus</name> when he 
saw that the death of <name type="person">Drusus</name> was not avenged on the murderers and was no 
grief to the people, grew bold in wickedness, and, now that his first 
attempt had succeeded, speculated on the possibility of destroying the 
children of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, whose succession to the throne was a certainty. 
There were three, and poison could not be distributed among them, because of 
the singular fidelity of their guardians and the unassailable virtue of 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>. So <name type="person">Sejanus</name> inveighed against <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s arrogance, and worked 
powerfully on <name type="person">Augusta</name>'s old hatred of her and on <name type="person">Livia</name>'s consciousness of 
recent guilt, and urged both these women to represent to the emperor that 
her pride as a mother and her reliance on popular enthusiasm were leading 
her to dream of empire. <name type="person">Livia</name> availed herself of the cunning of accusers, 
among whom she had selected <name type="person">Julius Postumus</name>, a man well suited to her 
purpose, as he had an intrigue with <name type="person">Mutilia Prisca</name>, and was consequently in 
the confidence of <name type="person">Augusta</name>, over whose mind <name type="person">Prisca</name> had great influence. She 
thus made her aged grandmother, whose nature it was to tremble for her 
power, irreconcilably hostile to her grandson's widow. <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s friends 
too were induced to be always inciting her proud spirit by mischievous 
talk.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> meanwhile, who did not 
relax his attention to business, and found solace in his work, occupied 
himself with the causes of citizens at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and with 
petitions from allies. Decrees of the Senate were passed at his proposal for 
relieving the cities of <rs type="placename">Cibyra</rs> and <rs type="placename">&AElig;gium</rs> in <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs>,

which had suffered from earthquakes, 
by a remission of three years' tribute. <name type="person">Vibius Serenus</name> too, proconsul of <rs type="placename">Further Spain</rs>, was condemned for violence in his 
official capacity, and was banished to the island of <rs type="placename">Amorgus</rs> for his savage temper. <name type="person">Carsidius Sacerdos</name>, 
accused of having helped our enemy <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> with supplies of grain, was 
acquitted, as was also <name type="person">Caius Gracchus</name> on the same charge. <name type="person">Gracchus</name>'s father, 
<name type="person">Sempronius</name>, had taken him when a mere child to the island of <rs type="placename">Cercina</rs> to be his companion in exile. There he grew up 
among outcasts who knew nothing of a liberal education, and after a while 
supported himself in <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> and <rs type="placename">Sicily</rs> by petty trade. But he did not escape the dangers 
of high rank. Had not his innocence been protected by <name type="person">&AElig;lius Lamia</name> and 
<name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>, successive governors of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, the 
splendid fame of that ill-starred family and the downfall of his father 
would have dragged him to ruin.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>This 
year too brought embassies from the Greek communities. The people of <rs type="placename">Samos</rs> and <rs type="placename">Cos</rs> petitioned for the 
confirmation of the ancient right of sanctuary for the respective temples of 
<name type="person">Juno</name> and <name type="person">&AElig;sculapius</name>. The <name type="ethnic">Samians</name> relied on a decree of the 
Amphictyonic Council, which had the supreme decision of all questions when 
the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, through the cities they had founded in <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, had possession of the sea-coast. <rs type="placename">Cos</rs> could boast equal antiquity, and it had an 
additional claim connected with the place. Roman citizens had been admitted 
to the temple of <name type="person">&AElig;sculapius</name>, when king <name type="person">Mithridates</name> ordered a general 
massacre of them throughout all the islands and cities of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>. </p>
<p>Next, after various and usually fruitless 
complaints from the pr&aelig;tors, the emperor finally brought forward a 
motion about the licentious behaviour of the players. "They had often," he 
said, "sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private 
families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, 
had become at once so indecent and so popular, that it must be checked by 
the Senate's authority." The players, upon this, were banished from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. </p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>That same 
year also brought fresh sorrow to the emperor by being fatal to one of the 
twin sons of <name type="person">Drusus</name> equally too by the death of an intimate friend. This 
was

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DEATHS IN IMPERIAL CIRCLE</note>
<name type="person">Lucilius Longus</name>, the 
partner of all his griefs and joys, the only senator who had been the 
companion of his retirement in <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs>. And so, 
though he was a man of humble origin, the Senate decreed him a censor's 
funeral and a statue in the <rs type="placename">forum of Augustus</rs> at the public expense. 
Everything indeed was as yet in the hands of the Senate, and consequently 
<name type="person">Lucilius Capito</name>, procurator of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, who was 
impeached by his province, was tried by them, the emperor vehemently 
asserting "that he had merely given the man authority over the slaves and 
property of the imperial establishments; that if he had taken upon himself 
the powers of a pr&aelig;tor and used military force, he had disregarded his 
instructions; therefore they must hear the provincials." So the case was 
heard and the accused condemned. The cities of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, 
gratified by this retribution and the punishment inflicted in the previous 
year on <name type="person">Caius Silanus</name>, voted a temple to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, his mother, and the 
Senate, and were permitted to build it. <name type="person">Nero</name> thanked the Senators and his 
grandfather on their behalf, and carried with him the joyful sympathies of 
his audience, who, with the memory of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> fresh in their minds, 
imagined that it was his face they saw, his voice they heard. The youth too 
had a modesty and a grace of person worthy of a prince, the more charming 
because of his peril from the notorious enmity of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>About the same time the emperor spoke on the 
subject of electing a priest of <name type="person">Jupiter</name> in the room of Servius Maluginensis, 
deceased, and of the enactment of a new law. "It was," he said, "the old 
custom to nominate together three patricians, sons of parents wedded 
according to the primitive ceremony, and of these one was to be chosen. Now 
however there was not the same choice as formerly, the primitive form of 
marriage having been given up or being observed only by a few persons." For 
this he assigned several reasons, the chief being men's and women's 
indifference; then, again, the ceremony itself had its difficulties, which 
were purposely avoided; and there was the objection that the man who 
obtained this priesthood was emancipated from the father's authority, as 
also was his wife, as passing into the husband's control. So the Senate, 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> argued, ought to apply some remedy by a decree or a law, as 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> had 

accommodated certain relics of a rude antiquity to 
the modern spirit. </p>
<p>It was then decided, after a discussion of religious 
questions, that the institution of the priests of <name type="person">Jupiter</name> should remain 
unchanged. A law however was passed that the priestess, in regard to her 
sacred functions, was to be under the husband's control, but in other 
respects to retain the ordinary legal position of women. <name type="person">Maluginensis</name>, the 
son, was chosen successor to his father. To raise the dignity of the 
priesthood and to inspire the priests with more zeal in attending to the 
ceremonial, a gift of two million sesterces was decreed to the <placeName key="tgn,2072890">Vestal</placeName> 
<name type="person">Cornelia</name>, chosen in the room of Scantia; and, whenever <name type="person">Augusta</name> entered the 
theatre, she was to have a place in the seats of the Vestals.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>In the consulship of <name type="person">Cornelius Cethegus</name> and 
<name type="person">Visellius Varro</name>, the pontiffs, whose example was followed by the other 
priests in offering prayers for the emperor's health, commended also <name type="person">Nero</name> 
and <name type="person">Drusus</name> to the same deities, not so much out of love for the young 
princes as out of sycophancy, the absence and excess of which in a corrupt 
age are alike dangerous. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> indeed, who was never friendly to the 
house of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, was then vexed beyond endurance at their youth being 
honoured equally with his declining years. He summoned the pontiffs, and 
asked them whether it was to the entreaties or the threats of <name type="person">Agrippina</name> that 
they had made this concession. And though they gave a flat denial, he 
rebuked them but gently, for many of them were her own relatives or were 
leading men in the State. However he addressed a warning to the Senate 
against encouraging pride in their young and excitable minds by premature 
honours. For <name type="person">Sejanus</name> spoke vehemently, and charged them with rending the 
State almost by civil war. "There were those," he said, "who called 
themselves the party of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and, unless they were checked, there 
would be more; the only remedy for the increasing discord was the overthrow 
of one or two of the most enterprising leaders."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>Accordingly he attacked <name type="person">Caius Silius</name> and <name type="person">Titius Sabinus</name>. The 
friendship of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> was fatal to both. As for <name type="person">Silius</name>, his having 
commanded a great army for seven years, and won in <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> the distinctions of a triumph for his

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SEJANUS RUINS SILIUS</note> 
success in the war with <name type="person">Sacrovir</name>, 
would make his downfall all the more tremendous and so spread greater terror 
among others. Many thought that he had provoked further displeasure by his 
own presumption and his extravagant boasts that his troops had been 
steadfastly loyal, while other armies were falling into mutiny, and that 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s throne could not have lasted had his legions too been bent on 
revolution. All this the emperor regarded as undermining his own power, 
which seemed to be unequal to the burden of such an obligation. For benefits 
received are a delight to us as long as we think we can requite them; when 
that possibility is far exceeded, they are repaid with hatred instead of 
gratitude.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p><name type="person">Silius</name> had a wife, <name type="person">Sosia 
Galla</name>, whose love of <name type="person">Agrippina</name> made her hateful to the emperor. The two, it 
was decided, were to be attacked, but <name type="person">Sabinus</name> was to be put off for a time. 
<name type="person">Varro</name>, the consul, was let loose on them, who, under colour of a hereditary 
feud, humoured the malignity of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> to his own disgrace. The accused 
begged a brief respite, until the prosecutor's consulship expired, but the 
emperor opposed the request. "It was usual," he argued, "for magistrates to 
bring a private citizen to trial, and a consul's authority ought not to be 
impaired, seeing that it rested with his vigilance to guard the commonwealth 
from loss." It was characteristic of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> to veil new devices in 
wickedness under ancient names. And so, with a solemn appeal, he summoned 
the Senate, as if there were any laws by which <name type="person">Silius</name> was being tried, as if 
<name type="person">Varro</name> were a real consul, or <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> a commonwealth. 
The accused either said nothing, or, if he attempted to defend himself, 
hinted, not obscurely, at the person whose resentment was crushing him. A 
long concealed complicity in <name type="person">Sacrovir</name>'s rebellion, a rapacity which sullied 
his victory, and his wife <name type="person">Sosia</name>'s conduct, were alleged against him. 
Unquestionably, they could not extricate themselves from the charge of 
extortion. The whole affair however was conducted as a trial for treason, 
and <name type="person">Silius</name> forestalled impending doom by a self-inflicted death.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>Yet there was a merciless confiscation of 
his property, though not to refund their money to the provincials, none of 
whom pressed any demand. But <name type="person">Augustus</name>'s bounty was wrested from him, and the 
claims of the imperial exchequer

were computed in detail. This 
was the first instance on <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s part of sharp dealing with the wealth 
of others. <name type="person">Sosia</name> was banished on the motion of <name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name>, who had 
proposed that half her estate should be confiscated, half left to the 
children. <name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name>, on the contrary, was for giving a fourth to the 
prosecutors, as the law required, and the remainder to the children. 
</p>
<p>This <name type="person">Lepidus</name>, I am satisfied, was for that age a wise and 
high-principled man. Many a cruel suggestion made by the flattery of others 
he changed for the better, and yet he did not want tact, seeing that he 
always enjoyed an uniform prestige, and also the favour of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. This 
compels me to doubt whether the liking of princes for some men and their 
antipathy to others depend, like other contingencies, on a fate and destiny 
to which we are born, or, to some degree, on our own plans; so that it is 
possible to pursue a course between a defiant independence and a debasing 
servility, free from ambition and its perils. <name type="person">Messalinus Cotta</name>, of equally 
illustrious ancestry as <name type="person">Lepidus</name>, but wholly different in disposition, 
proposed that the Senate should pass a decree providing that even innocent 
governors who knew nothing of the delinquencies of others should be punished 
for their wives' offences in the provinces as much as for their own.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>Proceedings were then taken against 
<name type="person">Calpurnius Piso</name>, a high-spirited nobleman. He it was, as I have related, who 
had exclaimed more than once in the Senate that he would quit <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> because of the combinations of the informers, and 
had dared, in defiance of <name type="person">Augusta</name>'s power, to sue <name type="person">Urgulania</name> and summon her 
from the emperor's palace. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> submitted to this at the time not 
ungraciously, but the remembrance of it was vividly impressed on a mind 
which brooded over its resentments, even though the first impulse of his 
displeasure had subsided. </p>
<p><name type="person">Quintus Granius</name> accused <name type="person">Piso</name> of secret 
treasonable conversation, and added that he kept poison in his house and 
wore a dagger whenever he came into the Senate. This was passed over as too 
atrocious to be true. He was to be tried on the other charges, a multitude 
of which were heaped on him, but his timely death cut short the trial. 
</p>
<p>Next was taken the case of <name type="person">Cassius Severus</name>, an exile. A

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PISO AND OTHERS</note>
man of mean origin 
and a life of crime, but a powerful pleader, he had brought on himself, by 
his persistent quarrelsomeness, a decision of the Senate, under oath, which 
banished him to <rs type="placename">Crete</rs>. There by the same practices 
he drew on himself, fresh odium and revived the old; stripped of his 
property and outlawed, he wore out his old age on the rock of 
<rs type="placename">Seriphos</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>About the same time 
<name type="person">Plautius Silvanus</name>, the pr&aelig;tor, for unknown reasons, threw his wife 
<name type="person">Apronia</name> out of a window. When summoned before the emperor by <name type="person">Lucius 
Apronius</name>, his father-in-law, he replied incoherently, representing that he 
was in a sound sleep and consequently knew nothing, and that his wife had 
chosen to destroy herself. Without a moment's delay <name type="person">Tiberius</name> went to the 
house and inspected the chamber, where were seen the marks of her struggling 
and of her forcible ejection. He reported this to the Senate, and as soon as 
judges had been appointed, <name type="person">Urgulania</name>, the grandmother of <name type="person">Silvanus</name>, sent her 
grandson a dagger. This was thought equivalent to a hint from the emperor, 
because of the known intimacy between <name type="person">Augusta</name> and <name type="person">Urgulania</name>. The accused 
tried the steel in vain, and then allowed his veins to be opened. Shortly 
afterwards <name type="person">Numantina</name>, his former wife, was charged with having caused her 
husband's insanity by magical incantations and potions, but she was 
acquitted.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>This year at last released 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> from her long contest with the Numidian 
<name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>. Former generals, when they thought that their successes were 
enough to insure them triumphal distinctions, left the enemy to himself. 
There were now in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> three laurelled statues, and 
yet <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> was still ravaging <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, 
strengthened by reinforcements from the <name type="ethnic">Moors</name>, who, under the boyish and 
careless rule of <name type="person">Ptolem&aelig;us</name>, <name type="person">Juba</name>'s son, had chosen war in preference 
to the despotism of freedmen and slaves. He had the king of the <name type="ethnic">Garamantes</name> 
to receive his plunder and to be the partner of his raids, not indeed with a 
regular army, but with detachments of light troops whose strength, as they 
came from a distance, rumour exaggerated. From the province itself every 
needy and restless adventurer hurried to join him, for the emperor, as if 
not an enemy remained in <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> after the 
achievements of <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>, had ordered the ninth legion home,

and <name type="person">Publius Dolabella</name>, proconsul that year, had not dared to retain 
it, because he feared the sovereign's orders more than the risks of 
war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p><name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> accordingly spread 
rumours that elsewhere also nations were rending the empire of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and that therefore her soldiers were gradually 
retiring from <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, and that the rest might be cut 
off by a strong effort on the part of all who loved freedom more than 
slavery. He thus augmented his force, and having formed a camp, he besieged 
the town of <rs type="placename">Thubuscum</rs>. <name type="person">Dolabella</name> meanwhile 
collecting all the troops on the spot, raised the siege at his first 
approach, by the terror of the Roman name and because the <name type="ethnic">Numidians</name> cannot 
stand against the charge of infantry. He then fortified suitable positions, 
and at the same time beheaded some chiefs of the <name type="ethnic">Musulamii</name>, who were on the 
verge of rebellion. Next, as several expeditions against <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name> had 
proved the uselessness of following up the enemy's desultory movements with 
the attack of heavy troops from a single point, he summoned to his aid king 
<name type="person">Ptolem&aelig;us</name> and his people, and equipped four columns, under the command 
of his lieutenants and tribunes. Marauding parties were also led by picked 
<name type="ethnic">Moors</name>, <name type="person">Dolabella</name> in person directing every operation.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>Soon afterwards news came that the <name type="ethnic">Numidians</name> had 
fixed their tents and encamped near a half-demolished fortress, by name 
<rs type="placename">Auzea</rs>, to which they had themselves formerly set fire, and on the position 
of which they relied, as it was inclosed by vast forests. Immediately the 
light infantry and cavalry, without knowing whither they were being led, 
were hurried along at quick march. Day dawned, and with the sound of 
trumpets and fierce shouts, they were on the half-asleep barbarians, whose 
horses were tethered or roaming over distant pastures. On the Roman side, 
the infantry was in close array, the cavalry in its squadrons, everything 
prepared for an engagement, while the enemy, utterly surprised, without 
arms, order, or plan, were seized slaughtered; or captured like cattle. The 
infuriated soldiers, remembering their hardships and how often the 
longed-for conflict had been eluded, sated themselves to a man with 
vengeance and bloodshed. The word went through the companies 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TACFARINAS FINALLY KILLED</note> that all were to aim at 
securing <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>, whom, after so many battles, they knew well, as there 
would be no rest from war except by the destruction of the enemy's leader. 
<name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>, his guards slain round him, his son a prisoner, and the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> 
bursting on him from every side, rushed on the darts, and by a death which 
was not unavenged, escaped captivity.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>This ended the war. <name type="person">Dolabella</name> asked for triumphal distinctions, but was 
refused by <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, out of compliment to <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, the glory of whose uncle 
<name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> he did not wish to be forgotten. But this did not make 
<name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name> more famous, while the refusal of the honour heightened 
<name type="person">Dolabella</name>'s renown. He had, in fact, with a smaller army, brought back with 
him illustrious prisoners and the fame of having slain the enemy's leader 
and terminated the war. In his train were envoys from the <name type="ethnic">Garamantes</name>, a rare 
spectacle in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. The nation, in its terror at the 
destruction of <name type="person">Tacfarinas</name>, and innocent of any guilty intention, had sent 
them to crave pardon of the Roman people. And now that this war had proved 
the zealous loyalty of <name type="person">Ptolem&aelig;us</name>, a custom of antiquity was revived, 
and one of the Senators was sent to present him with an ivory sceptre and an 
embroidered robe, gifts anciently bestowed by the Senate, and to confer on 
him the titles of king, ally, and friend.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>The same summer, the germs of a slave war in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> were crushed by a fortunate accident. The 
originator of the movement was <name type="person">Titus Curtisius</name>, once a soldier of the 
pr&aelig;torian guard. First, by secret meetings at <rs type="placename">Brundisium</rs> and the neighbouring towns, then by placards 
publicly exhibited, he incited the rural and savage slave-population of the 
remote forests to assert their freedom. By divine providence, three vessels 
came to land for the use of those who traversed that sea. In the same part 
of the country too was <name type="person">Curtius Lupus</name>, the qu&aelig;stor, who, according to 
ancient precedent, had had the charge of the "woodland pastures" assigned to 
him. Putting in motion a force of marines, he broke up the seditious 
combination in its very first beginnings. The emperor at once sent <name type="person">Staius</name>, a 
tribune, with a strong detachment, by whom the ringleader himself, with his 
most daring followers, were brought prisoners to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>,

where men already trembled at the vast 
scale of the slave-establishments, in which there was an immense growth, 
while the freeborn populace daily decreased.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>That same consulship witnessed a horrible instance of misery and 
brutality. A father as defendant, a son as prosecutor, (<name type="person">Vibius Serenus</name> was 
the name of both) were brought before the Senate; the father, dragged from 
exile in filth and squalor now stood in irons, while the son pleaded for his 
guilt. With studious elegance of dress and cheerful looks, the youth, at 
once accuser and witness, alleged a plot against the emperor and that men 
had been sent to <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs> to excite rebellion, further 
adding that <name type="person">C&aelig;cilius Cornutus</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, had furnished 
money. <name type="person">Cornutus</name>, weary of anxiety and feeling that peril was equivalent to 
ruin, hastened to destroy himself. But the accused with fearless spirit, 
looked his son in the face, shook his chains, and appealed to the vengeance 
of the gods, with a prayer that they would restore him to his exile, where 
he might live far away from such practices, and that, as for his son, 
punishment might sooner or later overtake him. He protested too that 
<name type="person">Cornutus</name> was innocent and that his terror was groundless, as would easily be 
perceived, if other names were given up; for he never would have plotted the 
emperor's murder and a revolution with only one confederate.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>Upon this the prosecutor named <name type="person">Cneius Lentulus</name> and 
<name type="person">Seius Tubero</name>, to the great confusion of the emperor, at finding a hostile 
rebellion and disturbance of the public peace charged on two leading men in 
the state, his own intimate friends, the first of whom was in extreme old 
age and the second in very feeble health. They were, however, at once 
acquitted. As for the father, his slaves were examined by torture, and the 
result was unfavourable to the accuser. The man, maddened by remorse, and 
terror-stricken by the popular voice, which menaced him with the dungeon, 
the rock, or a parricide's doom, fled from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. He 
was dragged back from <rs type="placename">Ravenna</rs>, and forced to go 
through the prosecution, during which <name type="person">Tiberius</name> did not disguise the old 
grudge he bore the exile <name type="person">Serenus</name>. For after <name type="person">Libo</name>'s conviction, <name type="person">Serenus</name> had 
sent the emperor a letter, upbraiding him for not having rewarded his 
special zeal in that trial, with

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">A FATHER ACCUSED BY HIS 
SON</note>
further hints more insolent than could be safely trusted to the 
easily offended ears of a despot. All this <name type="person">Tiberius</name> revived eight years 
later, charging on him various misconduct during that interval, even though 
the examination by torture, owing to the obstinacy of the slaves, had 
contradicted his guilt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>The Senate 
then gave their votes that <name type="person">Serenus</name> should be punished according to ancient 
precedent, when the emperor, to soften the odium of the affair, interposed 
with his veto. Next, <name type="person">Gallus Asinius</name> proposed that he should be confined in 
<rs type="placename">Gyaros</rs> or <rs type="placename">Donusa</rs>, but this 
he rejected, on the ground that both these islands were deficient in water, 
and that he whose life was spared, ought to be allowed the necessaries of 
life. And so <name type="person">Serenus</name> was conveyed back to <rs type="placename">Amorgus</rs>. 
</p>
<p>In consequence of the suicide of <name type="person">Cornutus</name>, it was proposed to deprive 
informers of their rewards whenever a person accused of treason put an end 
to his life by his own act before the completion of the trial. The motion 
was on the point of being carried when the emperor, with a harshness 
contrary to his manner, spoke openly for the informers, complaining that the 
laws would be ineffective, and the State brought to the verge of ruin. 
"Better," he said, "to subvert the constitution than to remove its 
guardians." Thus the informers, a class invented to destroy the 
commonwealth, and never enough controlled even by legal penalties, were 
stimulated by rewards.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>Some little 
joy broke this long succession of horrors. <name type="person">Caius Cominius</name>, a Roman knight, 
was spared by the emperor, against whom he was convicted of having written 
libellous verses, at the intercession of his brother, who was a Senator. 
Hence it seemed the more amazing that one who knew better things and the 
glory which waits on mercy, should prefer harsher courses. He did not indeed 
err from dulness, and it is easy to see when the acts of a sovereign meet 
with genuine, and when with fictitious popularity. And even he himself, 
though usually artificial in manner, and though his words escaped him with a 
seeming struggle, spoke out freely and fluently whenever he came to a man's 
rescue. </p>
<p>In another case, that of <name type="person">Publius Suillius</name>, formerly 
qu&aelig;stor to <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, who was to be expelled from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> on a con-

viction of having received 
money for a judicial decision, he held that the man ought to be banished to 
an island, and so intensely strong was his feeling that he bound the Senate 
by an oath that this was a State necessity. The act was thought cruel at the 
moment, but subsequently it redounded to his honour when <name type="person">Suillius</name> returned 
from exile. The next age saw him in tremendous power and a venal creature of 
the emperor <name type="person">Claudius</name>, whose friendship he long used, with success, never for 
good.</p>
<p>The same punishment was adjudged to <name type="person">Catus Firmius</name>, a Senator, for 
having (it was alleged) assailed his sister with a false charge of treason. 
<name type="person">Catus</name>, as I have related, had drawn <name type="person">Libo</name> into a snare and then destroyed him 
by an information. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> remembering this service, while he alleged other 
reasons, deprecated a sentence of exile, but did not oppose his expulsion 
from the Senate.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>Much of what I have 
related and shall have to relate, may perhaps, I am aware, seem petty 
trifles to record. But no one must compare my annals with the writings of 
those who have described <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> in old days. They told 
of great wars, of the storming of cities, of the defeat and capture of 
kings, or whenever they turned by preference to home affairs, they related, 
with a free scope for digression, the strifes of consuls with tribunes, land 
and corn-laws, and the struggles between the commons and the aristocracy. My 
labours are circumscribed and inglorious; peace wholly unbroken or but 
slightly disturbed, dismal misery in the capital, an emperor careless about 
the enlargement of the empire, such is my theme. Still it will not be 
useless to study those at first sight trifling events out of which the 
movements of vast changes often take their rise.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>All nations and cities are ruled by the people, the nobility, or 
by one man. A constitution, formed by selection out of these elements, it is 
easy to commend but not to produce; or, if it is produced, it cannot be 
lasting. Formerly, when the people had power or when the patricians were in 
the ascendant, the popular temper and the methods of controlling it, had to 
be studied, and those who knew most accurately the spirit of the Senate and 
aristocracy, had the credit of understanding the age and of being wise men. 
So

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CONTEMPORARY HISTORY SORDID</note>
now, after a 
revolution, when <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> is nothing but the realm of a 
single despot, there must be good in carefully noting and recording this 
period, for it is but few who have the foresight to distinguish right from 
wrong or what is sound from what is hurtful, while most men learn wisdom 
from the fortunes of others. Still, though this is instructive, it gives 
very little pleasure. Descriptions of countries, the various incidents of 
battles, glorious deaths of great generals, enchain and refresh a reader's 
mind. I have to present in succession the merciless biddings of a tyrant, 
incessant prosecutions, faithless friendships, the ruin of innocence, the 
same causes issuing in the same results, and I am everywhere confronted by a 
wearisome monotony in my subject matter. Then, again, an ancient historian 
has but few disparagers, and no one cares whether you praise more heartily 
the armies of <rs type="placename">Carthage</rs> or <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. But of many who endured punishment or disgrace 
under <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, the descendants yet survive; or even though the families 
themselves may be now extinct, you will find those who, from a resemblance 
of character, imagine that the evil deeds of others are a reproach to 
themselves. Again, even honour and virtue make enemies, condemning, as they 
do, their opposites by too close a contrast. But I return to my work.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>In the year of the consulship of <name type="person">Cornelius 
Cossus</name> and <name type="person">Asinius Agrippa</name>, <name type="person">Cremutius Cordus</name> was arraigned on a new charge, 
now for the first time heard. He had published a history in which he had 
praised <name type="person">Marcus Brutus</name> and called <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name> the last of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. His 
accusers were <name type="person">Satrius Secundus</name> and <name type="person">Pinarius Natta</name>, creatures of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>. 
This was enough to ruin the accused; and then too the emperor listened with 
an angry frown to his defence, which <name type="person">Cremutius</name>, resolved to give up his 
life, began thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is my words, Senators, which are condemned, 
so innocent am I of any guilty act; yet these do not touch the emperor or 
the emperor's mother, who are alone comprehended under the law of treason. I 
am said to have praised <name type="person">Brutus</name> and <name type="person">Cassius</name>, whose careers many have 
described and no one mentioned without eulogy. <name type="person">Titus Livius</name>, pre-eminently 
famous for eloquence and truthfulness, extolled <name type="person">Cneius Pompeius</name> in such a 
panegyric that <name type="person">Augustus</name> called

him <name type="person">Pompeianus</name>, and yet this was 
no obstacle to their friendship. <name type="person">Scipio</name>, <name type="person">Afranius</name>, this very <name type="person">Cassius</name>, this 
same <name type="person">Brutus</name>, he nowhere describes as brigands and traitors, terms now 
applied to them, but repeatedly as illustrious men. <name type="person">Asinius Pollio</name>'s 
writings too hand down a glorious memory of them, and <name type="person">Messala Corvinus</name> used 
to speak with pride of <name type="person">Cassius</name> as his general. Yet both these men prospered 
to the end with wealth and preferment. Again, that book of <name type="person">Marcus Cicero</name>, in 
which he lauded <name type="person">Cato</name> to the skies, how else was it answered by <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> 
the dictator, than by a written oration in reply, as if he was pleading in 
court? The letters of <name type="person">Antonius</name>, the harangues of <name type="person">Brutus</name> contain reproaches 
against <name type="person">Augustus</name>, false indeed, but urged with powerful sarcasm; the poems 
which we read of <name type="person">Bibaculus</name> and <name type="person">Catullus</name> are crammed with invectives on the 
C&aelig;sars. Yet the Divine <name type="person">Julius</name>, the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> themselves bore all 
this and let it pass, whether in forbearance or in wisdom I cannot easily 
say. Assuredly what is despised is soon forgotten; when you resent a thing, 
you seem to recognise it."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>"Of the 
<name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> I say nothing; with them not only liberty, but even license went 
unpunished, or if a person aimed at chastising, he retaliated on satire by 
satire. It has, however, always been perfectly open to us without any one to 
censure, to speak freely of those whom death has withdrawn alike from the 
partialities of hatred or esteem. Are <name type="person">Cassius</name> and <name type="person">Brutus</name> now in arms on the 
fields of <rs type="placename">Philippi</rs>, and am I with them rousing the 
people by harangues to stir up civil war? Did they not fall more than 
seventy years ago, and as they are known to us by statues which even the 
conqueror did not destroy, so too is not some portion of their memory 
preserved for us by historians? To every man posterity gives his due honour, 
and, if a fatal sentence hangs over me, there will be those who will 
remember me as well as <name type="person">Cassius</name> and <name type="person">Brutus</name>." </p>
<p>He then left the Senate and 
ended his life by starvation. His books, so the Senators decreed, were to be 
burnt by the aediles; but some copies were left which were concealed and 
afterwards published. And so one is all the more inclined to laugh at the 
stupidity of men who suppose that the despotism of the present can actually 
efface the remem-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CREMUTIUS CORDUS' WORKS 
BURNED</note>
brances of the next generation. On the contrary, the 
persecution of genius fosters its influence; foreign tyrants, and all who 
have imitated their oppression, have merely procured infamy for themselves 
and glory for their victims.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>That 
year was such a continuous succession of prosecutions that on the days of 
the Latin festival when <name type="person">Drusus</name>, as city-prefect, had ascended his tribunal 
for the inauguration of his office, <name type="person">Calpurnius Salvianus</name> appeared before him 
against <name type="person">Sextus Marius</name>. This the emperor openly censured, and it caused the 
banishment of <name type="person">Salvianus</name>. Next, the people of <rs type="placename">Cyzicus</rs> 
were accused of publicly neglecting the established worship of the Divine 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, and also of acts of violence to Roman citizens. They were deprived 
of the franchise which they had earned during the war with <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, when 
their city was besieged, and when they repulsed the king as much by their 
own bravery as by the aid of <name type="person">Lucullus</name>. Then followed the acquittal of 
<name type="person">Fonteius Capito</name>, the late proconsul of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, on 
proof that charges brought against him by <name type="person">Vibius Serenus</name> were fictitious. 
Still this did not injure <name type="person">Serenus</name>, to whom public hatred was actually a 
protection. Indeed any conspicuously restless informer was, so to say, 
inviolable; only the insignificant and undistinguished were punished.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>About the same time <rs type="placename">Further Spain</rs> sent a deputation to the Senate, with a 
request to be allowed, after the example of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, to 
erect a temple to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> and his mother. On this occasion, the emperor, 
who had generally a strong contempt for honours, and now thought it right to 
reply to the rumour which reproached him with having yielded to vanity, 
delivered the following speech:&mdash; </p>
<p>"I am aware, Senators, that many 
deplore my want of firmness in not having opposed a similar recent petition 
from the cities of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>. I will therefore both 
explain the grounds of my previous silence and my intentions for the future. 
Inasmuch as the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> did not forbid the founding of a temple at 
<rs type="placename">Pergamos</rs> to himself and to the city of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, I who respect as law all his actions and sayings, 
have the more readily followed a precedent once approved, seeing that with 
the worship of myself was linked an expression of reverence towards the 
Senate. But though it may be par-

donable to have allowed this 
once, it would be a vain and arrogant thing to receive the sacred honour of 
images representing the divine throughout all the provinces, and the homage 
paid to <name type="person">Augustus</name> will disappear if it is vulgarised by indiscriminate 
flattery.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>"For myself, Senators, I am 
mortal and limited to the functions of humanity, content if I can adequately 
fill the highest place; of this I solemnly assure you, and would have 
posterity remember it. They will more than sufficiently honour my memory by 
believing me to have been worthy of my ancestry, watchful over your 
interests, courageous in danger, fearless of enmity, when the State required 
it. These sentiments of your hearts are my temples, these my most glorious 
and abiding monuments. Those built of stone are despised as mere tombs, if 
the judgment of posterity passes into hatred. And therefore this is my 
prayer to our allies, our citizens, and to heaven itself; to the last, that, 
to my life's close, it grant me a tranquil mind, which can discern alike 
human and divine claims; to the first, that, when I die, they honour my 
career and the reputation of my name with praise and kindly remembrance." </p>
<p>Henceforth <name type="person">Tiberius</name> even in private conversations persisted in showing 
contempt for such homage to himself. Some attributed this to modesty; many 
to self-distrust; a few to a mean spirit. "The noblest men," it was said, 
"have the loftiest aspirations, and so <name type="person">Hercules</name> and <name type="person">Bacchus</name> among the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> 
and <name type="person">Quirinus</name> among us were enrolled in the number of the gods. <name type="person">Augustus</name>, did 
better, seeing that he had aspired. All other things princes have as a 
matter of course; one thing they ought insatiably to pursue, that their 
memory may be glorious. For to despise fame is to despise merit."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p><name type="person">Sejanus</name> meanwhile, dazed by his extravagant 
prosperity and urged on too by a woman's passion, <name type="person">Livia</name> now insisting on his 
promise of marriage, addressed a memorial to the emperor. For it was then 
the custom to apply to him by writing, even though he was at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. This petition was to the following 
effect:&mdash;The kindness of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, the father, and then the many 
favourable testimonies of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, the son, had engendered the habit of 
confiding his hopes and wishes to the ears of emperors as readily as to 
those of

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SEJANUS SEEKS MARRIAGE WITH LIVIA</note>
the gods. 
The splendor of high distinctions he had never craved; he had rather chosen 
watchings and hardships, like one of the common soldiers, for the emperor's 
safety. But there was one most glorious honour he had won, the reputation of 
being worthy of an alliance with a C&aelig;sar. This was the first motive of 
his ambition. As he had heard that <name type="person">Augustus</name>, in marrying his daughter, had 
even entertained some thoughts of Roman knights, so if a husband were sought 
for <name type="person">Livia</name>, he hoped <name type="person">Tiberius</name> would bear in mind a friend who would find his 
reward simply in the glory of the alliance. He did not wish to rid himself 
of the duties imposed on him; he thought it enough for his family to be 
secured against the unjust displeasure of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and this for the sake 
of his children. For, as for himself, enough and more than enough for him 
would be a life completed while such a sovereign still reigned.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name>, in reply, after praising the loyal 
sentiments of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> and briefly enumerating the favours he had bestowed on 
him, asked time for impartial consideration, adding that while other men's 
plans depended on their ideas of their own interest, princes, who had to 
regulate their chief actions by public opinion, were in a different 
position. "Hence," he said, "I do not take refuge in an answer which it 
would be easy to return, that <name type="person">Livia</name> can herself decide whether she considers 
that, after <name type="person">Drusus</name>, she ought again to marry or rather to endure life in the 
same home, and that she has in her mother and grandmother counsellors nearer 
and dearer to her. I will deal more frankly. First, as to the enmity of 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>, I maintain that it will blaze out more fiercely if <name type="person">Livia</name>'s 
marriage rends, so to say, the house of the C&aelig;sars into two factions. 
Even as it is, feminine jealousies break out, and my grandsons are torn 
asunder by the strife. What will happen if the rivalry is rendered more 
intense by such a marriage? For you are mistaken, <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, if you think that 
you will then remain in the same position, and that <name type="person">Livia</name>, who has been the 
wife of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> and afterwards of <name type="person">Drusus</name>, will have the 
inclination to pass her old age with a mere Roman knight. Though I might 
allow it, do you imagine it would be tolerated by those who have seen her 
brother, her father, and our an-

cestors in the highest offices 
of state? You indeed desire to keep within your station; but those 
magistrates and nobles who intrude on you against your wishes and consult 
you on all matters, openly give out that you have long overstepped the rank 
of a knight and gone far beyond my father's friendships, and from their 
dislike of you they also condemn me. But, you say, <name type="person">Augustus</name> had thoughts of 
giving his daughter to a Roman knight. Is it surprising that, with so many 
distracting cares, foreseeing too the immense elevation to which a man would 
be raised above others by such an alliance, he talked of <name type="person">Caius Proculeius</name> 
and certain persons of singularly quiet life, wholly free from political 
entanglements? Still, if the hesitation of <name type="person">Augustus</name> is to influence us, how 
much stronger is the fact that he bestowed his daughter on <name type="person">Marcus Agrippa</name>, 
then on myself. All this, as a friend, I have stated without reserve, but I 
will not oppose your plans or those of <name type="person">Livia</name>. My own earnest thoughts and 
the ties with which I am still purposing to unite you to myself, I shall for 
the present forbear to explain. This only I will declare, that nothing is 
too grand to be deserved by your merits and your goodwill towards me. When 
an opportunity presents itself, either in the Senate, or in a popular 
assembly, I shall not be silent."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p><name type="person">Sejanus</name>, no longer thinking of his marriage but filled with a deeper alarm, 
rejoined by deprecating the whispers of suspicion, popular rumour and the 
gathering storm of odium. That he might not impair his influence by closing 
his doors on the throngs of his many visitors or strengthen the hands of 
accusers by admitting them, he made it his aim to induce <name type="person">Tiberius</name> to live in 
some charming spot at a distance from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. In this 
he foresaw several advantages. Access to the emperor would be under his own 
control, and letters, for the most part being conveyed by soldiers, would 
pass through his hands. <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> too, who was already in the decline of 
life, would soon, when enervated by retirement, more readily transfer to him 
the functions of empire; envy towards himself would be lessened when there 
was an end to his crowded lev&eacute;es and the reality of power would be 
increased by the removal of its empty show. So he began to declaim against 
the laborious life of the capital, the bustling crowds and

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PRESSURE ON TIBERIUS TO LEAVE <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note>
streaming multitudes, while he praised 
repose and solitude, with their freedom from vexations and 
misunderstandings, and their special opportunities for the study of the 
highest questions.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>It happened that 
the trial at this time of <name type="person">Votienus Montanus</name>, a popular wit, convinced the 
hesitating <name type="person">Tiberius</name> that he ought to shun all assemblies of the Senate, 
where speeches, often true and offensive, were flung in his very face. 
<name type="person">Votienus</name> was charged with insulting expressions towards the emperor, and 
while the witness, <name type="person">&AElig;milius</name>, a military man, in his eagerness to prove 
the case, repeated the whole story and amid angry clamour struggled on with 
loud assertion, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> heard the reproaches by which he was assailed in 
secret, and was so deeply impressed that he exclaimed that he would clear 
himself either at once or on a legal inquiry, and the entreaties of friends, 
with the flattery of the whole assembly, hardly restored his composure. As 
for <name type="person">Votienus</name>, he suffered the penalty of treason; but the emperor, clinging 
all the more obstinately to the harshness with which he had been reproached 
in regard to accused persons, punished <name type="person">Aquilia</name> with exile for the crime of 
adultery with <name type="person">Varius Ligur</name>, although <name type="person">Lentulus G&aelig;tulicus</name>, the 
consul-elect, had proposed that she should be sentenced under the <placeName key="tgn,2118773">Julian</placeName> 
law. He next struck off <name type="person">Apidius Merula</name> from the register of the Senate for 
not having sworn obedience to the legislation of the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>Then a hearing was given to embassies from 
the <name type="ethnic">Laced&aelig;monians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Messenians</name> on the question of the temple of 
<name type="person">Diana</name> in the Marshes. The <name type="ethnic">Laced&aelig;monians</name> asserted that it had been 
dedicated by their ancestors and in their territory, and appealed to the 
records of their history and the hymns of poets, but it had been wrested 
from them, they said, by the arms of the Macedonian <name type="person">Philip</name>, with whom they 
had fought, and subsequently restored by the decision of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> 
and <name type="person">Marcus Antonius</name>. The <name type="ethnic">Messenians</name>, on the contrary, alleged the ancient 
division of the <rs type="placename">Peloponnesus</rs> among the descendants 
of <name type="person">Hercules</name>, in which the territory of <rs type="placename">Denthelia</rs> 
(where the temple stood) had fallen to their king. Records of this event 
still existed, engraven on stone and ancient bronze. But if they were asked 
for the testimony

of poetry and of history, they had it, they 
said, in greater abundance and authenticity. <name type="person">Philip</name> had not decided 
arbitrarily, but according to fact, and king <name type="person">Antigonus</name>, as also the general 
<name type="person">Mummius</name>, had pronounced the same judgment. Such too had been the award of 
the <name type="ethnic">Milesians</name> to whom the arbitration had been publicly entrusted, and, 
finally, of <name type="person">Atidius Geminus</name>, the pr&aelig;tor of <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs>. And so the question was decided in favour of the 
<name type="ethnic">Messenians</name>. </p>
<p>Next the people of <rs type="placename">Segesta</rs> 
petitioned for the restoration of the temple of <name type="person">Venus</name> at <rs type="placename">Mount Eryx</rs>, which had fallen to ruin from its antiquity. 
They repeated the well-known story of its origin, which delighted <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. 
He undertook the work willingly, as being a kinsman of the goddess. After 
this was discussed a petition from the city of <rs type="placename">Massilia</rs>, and sanction given to the precedent of <name type="person">Publius 
Rutilius</name>, who having been legally banished from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, had been adopted as a citizen by the people of <rs type="placename">Smyrna</rs>. <name type="person">Volcatius Moschus</name>, also an exile, had been 
received with a similar privilege by the inhabitants of <rs type="placename">Massilia</rs>, and had left his property to their community, 
as being now his own country.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>Two men 
of noble rank died in that year, <name type="person">Cneius Lentulus</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Domitius</name>. It had 
been the glory of <name type="person">Lentulus</name>, to say nothing of his consulship and his 
triumphal distinctions over the G&aelig;tuli, to have borne poverty with a 
good grace, then to have attained great wealth, which had been blamelessly 
acquired and was modestly enjoyed. <name type="person">Domitius</name> derived lustre from a father who 
during the civil war had been master of the sea, till he united himself to 
the party of <name type="person">Antonius</name> and afterwards to that of <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>. His grandfather 
had fallen in the battle of <rs type="placename">Pharsalia</rs>, fighting for 
the aristocracy. He had himself been chosen to be the husband of the younger 
<name type="person">Antonia</name>, daughter of <name type="person">Octavia</name>, and subsequently led an army across the <rs type="placename">Elbe</rs>, penetrating further into <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> than any <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> before him. For this achievement 
he gained triumphal honours. </p>
<p><name type="person">Lucius Antonius</name> too then died, of a most 
illustrious but unfortunate family. His father, <name type="person">Julius Antonius</name>, was 
capitally punished for adultery with <name type="person">Julia</name>, and the son, when a mere youth, 
was banished by <name type="person">Augustus</name>, whose sister's grandson he was, to the city of <rs type="placename">Massilia</rs>, where the name of exile

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">A 
MURDER IN <rs type="placename">SPAIN</rs></note>
might be masked under that of 
student. Yet honour was paid him in death, and his bones, by the Senate's 
decree, were consigned to the sepulchre of the Octavii.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>While the same consuls were in office, an atrocious 
crime was committed in <rs type="placename">Nearer Spain</rs> by a peasant of 
the Termestine tribe. Suddenly attacking the pr&aelig;tor of the province, 
<name type="person">Lucius Piso</name>, as he was travelling in all the carelessness of peace, he 
killed him with a single wound. He then fled on a swift horse, and reached a 
wooded country, where he parted with his steed and eluded pursuit amid rocky 
and pathless wilds. But he was soon discovered. The horse was caught and led 
through the neighbouring villages, and its owner ascertained. Being found 
and put to the torture that he might be forced to reveal his accomplices, he 
exclaimed in a loud voice, in the language of his country, that it was in 
vain to question him; his comrades might stand by and look on, but that the 
most intense agony would not wring the truth from him. Next day, when he was 
dragged back to torture, he broke loose from his guards and dashed his head 
against a stone with such violence that he instantly fell dead. It was 
however believed that <name type="person">Piso</name> was treacherously murdered by the <name type="ethnic">Termestini</name>. 
Some public money had been embezzled, and he was pressing for its payment 
too rigorously for the patience of barbarians.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>In the consulship of <name type="person">Lentulus G&aelig;tulicus</name> and <name type="person">Caius 
Calvisius</name>, triumphal distinctions were decreed to <name type="person">Popp&aelig;us Sabinus</name>, for 
a crushing defeat of some Thracian tribes, whose wild life in the highlands 
of a mountainous country made them unusually fierce. Besides their natural 
ferocity, the rebellion had its origin in their scornful refusal to endure 
levies and to supply our armies with their bravest men. Even native princes 
they would obey only according to their caprice, and if they sent aid, they 
used to appoint their own leaders and fight only against their neighbours. A 
rumour had then spread itself among them that, dispersed and mingled with 
other tribes, they were to be dragged away to distant countries. Before 
however they took up arms, they sent envoys with assurances of their 
friendship and loyalty, which, they said, would continue, if they were not 
tried by any fresh burden. But if they were doomed to slavery as a

conquered people, they had swords and young warriors and a spirit 
bent on freedom or resigned to death. As they spoke, they pointed to 
fortresses amid rocks whither they had conveyed their parents and their 
wives, and threatened us with a difficult, dangerous and sanguinary 
war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p><name type="person">Sabinus</name> meantime, while he was 
concentrating his troops, returned gentle answers; but on the arrival of 
<name type="person">Pomponius Labeo</name> with a legion from <rs type="placename">M&oelig;sia</rs> and 
of king <name type="person">Rh&oelig;metalces</name> with some reinforcements from his subjects, who 
had not thrown off their allegiance, with these and the force he had on the 
spot, he advanced on the enemy, who were drawn up in some wooded defiles. 
Some ventured to show themselves on the open hills; these the Roman general 
approached in fighting order and easily dislodged them, with only a small 
slaughter of the barbarians, who had not far to flee. In this position he 
soon established a camp, and held with a strong detachment a narrow and 
unbroken mountain ridge, stretching as far as the next fortress, which was 
garrisoned by a large force of armed soldiers along with some irregulars. 
Against the boldest of these, who after the manner of their country were 
disporting themselves with songs and dances in front of the rampart, he sent 
some picked archers, who, discharging distant volleys, inflicted many wounds 
without loss to themselves. As they advanced, a sudden sortie put them to 
the rout, and they fell back on the support of a Sugambrian cohort, drawn up 
at no great distance by the Roman general, ready for any emergency and as 
terrible as the foe, with the noise of their war songs and the clashing of 
their arms.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>He then moved his camp 
near to the enemy, leaving in his former entrenchments the <name type="ethnic">Thracians</name> who, as 
I have mentioned, were with us. These had permission to ravage, burn, and 
plunder, provided they confined their forays to daylight, and passed the 
night securely and vigilantly in their camp. This at first they strictly 
observed. Soon they resigned themselves to enjoyment, and, enriched by 
plunder, they neglected their guards, and amid feasts and mirth sank down in 
the carelessness of the banquet, of sleep and of wine. So the enemy, 
apprised of their heedlessness, prepared two detachments, one of which was 
to attack the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">REBELLION IN <rs type="placename">THRACE</rs> 
CRUSHED</note>
plunderers, the other, to fall on the Roman camp, not with 
the hope of taking it, but to hinder the din of the other battle from being 
heard by our soldiers, who, with shouts and missiles around them, would be 
all intent on their own peril. Night too was chosen for the movement to 
increase the panic. Those however who tried to storm the entrenchment of the 
legions were easily repulsed; the Thracian auxiliaries were dismayed by the 
suddenness of the onset, for though some were lying close to their lines, 
far more were straggling beyond them, and the massacre was all the more 
savage, inasmuch as they were taunted with being fugitives and traitors and 
bearing arms for their own and their country's enslavement.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>Next day <name type="person">Sabinus</name> displayed his forces in the plain, 
on the chance of the barbarians being encouraged by the night's success to 
risk an engagement. Finding that they did not quit the fortress and the 
adjoining hills, he began a siege by means of the works which he had 
opportunely began to construct; then he drew a fosse and stockade enclosing 
an extent of four miles, and by degrees contracted and narrowed his lines, 
with the view of cutting off their water and forage. He also threw up a 
rampart, from which to discharge stones, darts, and brands on the enemy, who 
was now within range. It was thirst however which chiefly distressed them, 
for there was only one spring for the use of a vast multitude of soldiers 
and non-combatants. Their cattle too, penned up close to them, after the 
fashion of barbarians, were dying of want of fodder; near them lay human 
bodies which had perished from wounds or thirst, and the whole place was 
befouled with rotting carcases and stench and infection. To their confusion 
was added the growing misery of discord, some thinking of surrender, others 
of destruction by mutual blows. Some there were who suggested a sortie 
instead of an unavenged death, and these were all men of spirit, though they 
differed in their plans.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>One of their 
chiefs, <name type="person">Dinis</name>, an old man who well knew by long experience both the strength 
and clemency of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, maintained that they must lay 
down their arms, this being the only remedy for their wretched plight, and 
he was the first to give himself up with his wife and children to the

conqueror. He was followed by all whom age or sex unfitted for war, 
by all too who had a stronger love of life than of renown. The young were 
divided between <name type="person">Tarsa</name> and <name type="person">Turesis</name> both of whom had resolved to fall together 
with their freedom. <name type="person">Tarsa</name> however kept urging them to speedy death and to 
the instant breaking off of all hope and fear, and, by way of example, 
plunged his sword into his heart. And there were some who chose the same 
death. <name type="person">Turesis</name> and his band waited for night, not without the knowledge of 
our general. Consequently, the sentries were strengthened with denser masses 
of troops. Night was coming on with a fierce storm and the foe, one moment 
with a tumultuous uproar, another in awful silence, had perplexed the 
besiegers, when <name type="person">Sabinus</name> went round the camp, entreating the men not to give 
a chance to their stealthy assailants by heeding embarrassing noises or 
being deceived by quiet, but to keep, every one, to his post without moving 
or discharging their darts on false alarms.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>The barbarians meanwhile rushed down with their bands, now 
hurling at the entrenchments stones such as the hand could grasp, stakes 
with points hardened by fire, and boughs lopped from oaks; now filling up 
the fosses with bushes and hurdles and dead bodies, while others advanced up 
to the breastwork with bridges and ladders which they had constructed for 
the occasion, seized it, tore it down, and came to close quarters with the 
defenders. Our soldiers on the other side drove them back with missiles, 
repelled them with their shields, and covered them with a storm of long 
siege-javelins and heaps of stones. Success already gained and the more 
marked disgrace which would follow repulse, were a stimulus to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, 
while the courage of the foe was heightened by this last chance of 
deliverance and the presence of many mothers and wives with mournful cries. 
Darkness, which increased the daring of some and the terror of others, 
random blows, wounds not foreseen, failure to recognise friend or enemy, 
echoes, seemingly in their rear, from the winding mountain valleys, spread 
such confusion that the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> abandoned some of their lines in the belief 
that they had been stormed. Only however a very few of the enemy had broken 
through them; the rest, after

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AGRIPPINA'S COUSIN 
CONDEMNED</note>
their bravest men had been beaten back or wounded, were 
towards daybreak pushed back to the upper part of the fortress and there at 
last compelled to surrender. Then the immediate neighbourhood, by the 
voluntary action of the inhabitants, submitted. The early and severe winter 
of <rs type="placename">Mount H&aelig;mus</rs> saved the rest of the 
population from being reduced by assault or blockade.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile, besides 
the shocks already sustained by the imperial house, came the first step 
towards the destruction of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, <name type="person">Claudia Pulchra</name>, her cousin, being 
prosecuted by <name type="person">Domitius Afer</name>. Lately a pr&aelig;tor, a man of but moderate 
position and eager to become notorious by any sort of deed, Afer charged her 
with unchastity, with having <name type="person">Furnius</name> for her paramour, and with attempts on 
the emperor by poison and sorcery. <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, always impetuous, and now 
kindled into fury by the peril of her kinswoman, went straight to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
and found him, as it happened, offering a sacrifice to his father. This 
provoked an indignant outburst. "It is not," she exclaimed, "for the same 
man to slay victims to the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> and to persecute his posterity. 
The celestial spirit has not transferred itself to the mute statue; here is 
the true image, sprung of heavenly blood, and she perceives her danger, and 
assumes its mournful emblems. <name type="person">Pulchra</name>'s name is a mere blind; the only 
reason for her destruction is that she has, in utter folly, selected 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name> for her admiration, forgetting that <name type="person">Sosia</name> was thereby ruined." 
These words wrung from the emperor one of the rare utterances of that 
inscrutable breast; he rebuked <name type="person">Agrippina</name> with a Greek verse, and reminded 
her that "she was not wronged because she was not a queen." <name type="person">Pulchra</name> and 
<name type="person">Furnius</name> were condemned. Afer was ranked with the foremost orators, for the 
ability which he displayed, and which won strong praise from <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, who 
pronounced him a speaker of natural genius. Henceforward as a counsel for 
the defence or the prosecution he enjoyed the fame of eloquence rather than 
of virtue, but old age robbed him of much of his speaking power, while, with 
a failing intellect, he was still impatient of silence.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p><name type="person">Agrippina</name> in stubborn rage, with the grasp of 
disease yet on her, when the emperor came to see her, wept long

and silently, and then began to mingle reproach and supplication. She 
begged him "to relieve her loneliness and provide her with a husband; her 
youth still fitted her for marrige, which was a virtuous woman's only 
solace, and there were citizens in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> who would 
not disdain to receive the wife of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and his children." But the 
emperor, who perceived the political aims of her request, but did not wish 
to show displeasure or apprehension, left her, notwithstanding her urgency, 
without an answer. This incident, not mentioned by any historian, I have 
found in the memoirs of the younger <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, the mother of the emperor 
<name type="person">Nero</name>, who handed down to posterity the story of her life and of the 
misfortunes of her family.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p><name type="person">Sejanus</name> 
meanwhile yet more deeply alarmed the sorrowing and unsuspecting woman by 
sending his agents, under the guise of friendship, with warnings that poison 
was prepared for her, and that she ought to avoid her father-in-law's table. 
Knowing not how to dissemble, she relaxed neither her features nor tone of 
voice as she sat by him at dinner, nor did she touch a single dish, till at 
last <name type="person">Tiberius</name> noticed her conduct, either casually or because he was told of 
it. To test her more closely, he praised some fruit as it was set on the 
table and passed it with his own hand to his daughter-in-law. This increased 
the suspicions of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and without putting the fruit to her lips she 
gave it to the slaves. Still no remark fell from <name type="person">Tiberius</name> before the 
company, but he turned to his mother and whispered that it was not 
surprising if he had decided on harsh treatment against one who implied that 
he was a poisoner. Then there was a rumour that a plan was laid for her 
destruction, that the emperor did not dare to attempt it openly, and was 
seeking to veil the deed in secrecy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name>, to divert people's talk, continually attended the Senate, and gave 
an audience of several days to embassies from <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> 
on a disputed question as to the city in which the temple before mentioned 
should be erected. Eleven cities were rivals for the honour, of which they 
were all equally ambitious, though they differed widely in resources. With 
little variation they dwelt on antiquity of race and loyalty to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> throughout her wars with <name type="person">Perseus</name>, <name type="person">Aristonicus</name>,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SEJANUS PERSECUTES AGRIPPINA</note> 
and other kings. But 
the people of <rs type="placename">Hyp&aelig;pa</rs>, <rs type="placename">Tralles</rs>, <rs type="placename">Laodic&aelig;a</rs>, and <rs type="placename">Magnesia</rs> were passed over as too insignificant; even <rs type="placename">Ilium</rs>, though it boasted that <rs type="placename">Troy</rs> was the cradle of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, was 
strong only in the glory of its antiquity. There was a little hesitation 
about <rs type="placename">Halicarnassus</rs>, as its inhabitants affirmed 
that for twelve hundred years their homes had not been shaken by an 
earthquake and that the foundations of their temple were on the living rock. 
<rs type="placename">Pergamos</rs>, it was thought, had been sufficiently 
honoured by having a temple of <name type="person">Augustus</name> in the city, on which very fact they 
relied. The <name type="ethnic">Ephesians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Milesians</name> had, it seemed, wholly devoted their 
respective towns to the worships of <name type="person">Apollo</name> and <name type="person">Diana</name>. And so the question 
lay between <rs type="placename">Sardis</rs> and <rs type="placename">Smyrna</rs>. The envoys from <rs type="placename">Sardis</rs> 
read a decree of the <name type="ethnic">Etrurians</name>, with whom they claimed kindred. "<name type="person">Tyrrhenus</name> 
and <name type="person">Lydus</name>," it was said, "the sons of King <name type="person">Atys</name>, divided the nation between 
them because of its multitude; <name type="person">Lydus</name> remained in the country of his fathers; 
<name type="person">Tyrrhenus</name> had the work assigned him of establishing new settlements, and 
names, taken from the two leaders, were given to the one people in <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> and to the other in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. 
The resources of the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> were yet further augmented by the immigration 
of nations into that part of <rs type="placename">Greece</rs> which afterwards 
took its name from <name type="person">Pelops</name>. They spoke too of letters from Roman generals, of 
treaties concluded with us during the Macedonian war, and of their copious 
rivers, of their climate, and the rich countries round them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p>The envoys from <rs type="placename">Smyrna</rs>, 
after tracing their city's antiquity back to such founders as either 
<name type="person">Tantalus</name>, the son of <name type="person">Jupiter</name>, or <name type="person">Theseus</name>, also of divine origin, or one of 
the <name type="ethnic">Amazons</name>, passed on to that on which they chiefly relied, their services 
to the Roman people, whom they had helped with naval armaments, not only in 
wars abroad, but in those under which we struggled in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. They had also been the first, they said, to build 
a temple in honour of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, during the consulship of 
<name type="person">Marcus Porcius Cato</name>, when <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s power indeed was great, but not yet raised 
to the highest point, inasmuch as the Punic capital was still standing and 
there were mighty kings in <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>. They appealed too 
to the testimony of <name type="person">Lucius Sulla</name>, whose army was once in terrible

jeopardy from a severe winter and want of clothing, and this having 
been announced at <rs type="placename">Smyrna</rs> in a public assembly, all 
who were present stript their clothes off their backs and sent them to our 
legions. And so the Senate, when the question was put, gave the preference 
to <rs type="placename">Smyrna</rs>. <name type="person">Vibius Marsus</name> moved that <name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name>, 
to whom the province of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> had been assigned, 
should have under him a special commissioner to undertake the charge of this 
temple. As <name type="person">Lepidus</name> himself, out of modesty, declined to appoint, <name type="person">Valerius 
Naso</name>, one of the ex-pr&aelig;tors, was chosen by lot and sent 
out.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>Meanwhile, after long reflection 
on his purpose and frequent deferment of it, the emperor retired into <rs type="placename">Campania</rs> to dedicate, as he pretended, a temple to 
<name type="person">Jupiter</name> at <rs type="placename">Capua</rs> and another to <name type="person">Augustus</name> at <rs type="placename">Nola</rs>, but really resolved to live at a distance from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Although I have followed most historians in 
attributing the cause of his retirement to the arts of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, still, as he 
passed six consecutive years in the same solitude after that minister's 
destruction, I am often in doubt whether it is not to be more truly ascribed 
to himself, and his wish to hide by the place of his retreat the cruelty and 
licentiousness which he betrayed by his actions. Some thought that in his 
old age he was ashamed of his personal appearance. He had indeed a tall, 
singularly slender and stooping figure, a bald head, a face full of 
eruptions, and covered here and there with plasters. In the seclusion of <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs> he had habituated himself to shun society and to 
hide his voluptuous life. According to one account his mother's domineering 
temper drove him away; he was weary of having her as his partner in power, 
and he could not thrust her aside, because he had received this very power 
as her gift. For <name type="person">Augustus</name> had had thoughts of putting the Roman state under 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, his sister's grandson, whom all men esteemed, but yielding to 
his wife's entreaties he left <name type="person">Germanicus</name> to be adopted by <name type="person">Tiberius</name> and 
adopted <name type="person">Tiberius</name> himself. With this <name type="person">Augusta</name> would taunt her son, and claim 
back what she had given.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>His 
departure was attended by a small retinue, one senator, who was an 
ex-consul, <name type="person">Cocceius Nerva</name>, learned in the laws, one Roman knight, besides 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name>, of the highest order, <name type="person">Curtius Atticus</name>, the rest being men of 
liberal culture,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TIBERIUS RETIRES TO <rs type="placename">CAMPANIA</rs></note>
for the most part <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, in whose 
conversation he might find amusement. It was said by men who knew the stars 
that the motions of the heavenly bodies when <name type="person">Tiberius</name> left <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> were such as to forbid the possibility of his 
return. This caused ruin to many who conjectured that his end was near and 
spread the rumour; for they never foresaw the very improbable contingency of 
his voluntary exile from his home for eleven years. Soon afterwards it was 
clearly seen what a narrow margin there is between such science and delusion 
and in what obscurity truth is veiled. That he would not return to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> was not a mere random assertion; as to the rest, 
they were wholly in the dark, seeing that he lived to extreme old age in the 
country or on the coast near <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and often close to 
the very walls of the city.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>It 
happened at this time that a perilous accident which occurred to the emperor 
strengthened vague rumours and gave him grounds for trusting more fully in 
the friendship and fidelity of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>. They were dining in a country house 
called "<placeName key="tgn,2443246">The Cave</placeName>," between the gulf of <rs type="placename">Amucl&aelig;</rs> and the hills of <rs type="placename">Fundi</rs>, in a natural grotto. The rocks at its entrance 
suddenly fell in and crushed some of the attendants; thereupon panic seized 
the whole company and there was a general flight of the guests. <name type="person">Sejanus</name> hung 
over the emperor, and with knee, face, and hand encountered the falling 
stones; and was found in this attitude by the soldiers who came to their 
rescue. After this he was greater than ever, and though his counsels were 
ruinous, he was listened to with confidence, as a man who had no care for 
himself. He pretended to act as a judge towards the children of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, 
after having suborned persons to assume the part of prosecutors and to 
inveigh specially against <name type="person">Nero</name>, next in succession to the throne, who, 
though he had proper youthful modesty, often forgot present expediency, 
while freedmen and clients, eager to get power, incited him to display 
vigour and self-confidence. "This," they said, "was what the Roman people 
wished, what the armies desired, and <name type="person">Sejanus</name> would not dare to oppose it, 
though now he insulted alike the tame spirit of the old emperor and the 
timidity of the young prince."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p><name type="person">Nero</name>, 
while he listened to this and like talk, was not

indeed inspired 
with any guilty ambition, but still occasionally there would break from him 
wilful and thoughtless expressions which spies about his person caught up 
and reported with exaggeration, and this he had no opportunity of rebutting. 
Then again alarms under various forms were continually arising. One man 
would avoid meeting him; another after returning his salutation would 
instantly turn away; many after beginning a conversation would instantly 
break it off, while <name type="person">Sejanus</name>'s friends would stand their ground and laugh at 
him. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> indeed wore an angry frown or a treacherous smile. Whether the 
young prince spoke or held his tongue, silence and speech were alike 
criminal. Every night had its anxieties, for his sleepless hours, his dreams 
and sighs were all made known by his wife to her mother <name type="person">Livia</name> and by <name type="person">Livia</name> 
to <name type="person">Sejanus</name>. <name type="person">Nero</name>'s brother <name type="person">Drusus</name> <name type="person">Sejanus</name> actually drew into his scheme by 
holding out to him the prospect of becoming emperor through the removal of 
an elder brother, already all but fallen. The savage temper of <name type="person">Drusus</name>, to 
say nothing of lust of power and the usual feuds between brothers, was 
inflamed with envy by the partiality of the mother <name type="person">Agrippina</name> towards <name type="person">Nero</name>. 
And yet <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, while he favoured <name type="person">Drusus</name>, was not without thoughts of 
sowing the seeds of his future ruin, well knowing how very impetuous he was 
and therefore the more exposed to treachery.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>Towards the close of the year died two distinguished men, 
<name type="person">Asinius Agrippa</name> and <name type="person">Quintus Haterius</name>. <name type="person">Agrippa</name> was of illustrious rather than 
ancient ancestry, which his career did not disgrace; <name type="person">Haterius</name> was of a 
senatorian family and famous for his eloquence while he lived, though the 
monuments which remain of his genius are not admired as of old. The truth is 
he succeeded more by vehemence than by finish of style. While the research 
and labours of other authors are valued by an after age, the harmonious 
fluency of <name type="person">Haterius</name> died with him.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>In 
the year of the consulship of <name type="person">Marcus Licinius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Calpurnius</name>, the 
losses of a great war were matched by an unexpected disaster, no sooner 
begun than ended. One <name type="person">Atilius</name>, of the freedman class, having undertaken to 
build an amphitheatre at <rs type="placename">Fidena</rs> for the exhibition 
of a show of gladiators, failed to lay a solid foundation and to frame the 


<note place="marg" anchored="yes">COLLAPSE OF AMPHITHEATRE AT <rs type="placename">FIDEN&AElig;</rs></note>
wooden superstructure with beams of 
sufficient strength; for he had neither an abundance of wealth, nor zeal for 
public popularity, but he had simply sought the work for sordid gain. 
Thither flocked all who loved such sights and who during the reign of 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> had been wholly debarred from such amusements; men and women of 
every age crowding to the place because it was near <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. And so the calamity was all the more fatal. The 
building was densely crowded; then came a violent shock, as it fell inwards 
or spread outwards, precipitating and burying an immense multitude which was 
intently gazing on the show or standing round. Those who were crushed to 
death in the first moment of the accident had at least under such dreadful 
circumstances the advantage of escaping torture. More to be pitied were they 
who with limbs torn from them still retained life, while they recognised 
their wives and children by seeing them during the day and by hearing in the 
night their screams and groans. Soon all the neighbours in their excitement 
at the report were bewailing brothers, kinsmen or parents. Even those whose 
friends or relatives were away from home for quite a different reason, still 
trembled for them, and as it was not yet known who had been destroyed by the 
crash, suspense made the alarm more widespread.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>As soon as they began to remove the d&eacute;bris, there was a 
rush to see the lifeless forms and much embracing and kissing. Often a 
dispute would arise, when some distorted face, bearing however a general 
resemblance of form and age, had baffled their efforts at recognition. Fifty 
thousand persons were maimed or destroyed in this disaster. For the future 
it was provided by a decree of the Senate that no one was to exhibit a show 
of gladiators, whose fortune fell short of four hundred thousand sesterces, 
and that no amphitheatre was to be erected except on a foundation, the 
solidity of which had been examined. 
was banished. At the moment of 
the calamity the nobles threw open their houses and supplied 
indiscriminately medicines and physicians, so that <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> then, notwithstanding her sorrowful aspect, wore a 
likeness to the manners of our forefathers who after a great battle always 
relieved the wounded with their bounty and attentions.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>This disaster was not forgotten when a 
furious conflagration damaged the capital to an unusual extent, reducing <rs type="placename">Mount C&aelig;lius</rs> to ashes. "It was an ill-starred 
year," people began to say, "and the emperor's purpose of leaving <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> must have been formed under evil omens." They began 
in vulgar fashion to trace ill-luck to guilt, when <name type="person">Tiberius</name> checked them by 
distributing money in proportion to losses sustained. He received a vote of 
thanks in the Senate from its distinguished members, and was applauded by 
the populace for having assisted with his liberality, without partiality or 
the solicitations of friends, strangers whom he had himself sought out. And 
proposals were also made that <rs type="placename">Mount C&aelig;lius</rs> 
should for the future be called <rs type="placename">Mount Augustus</rs>, 
inasmuch as when all around was in flames only a single statue of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
in the house of one <name type="person">Junius</name>, a senator, had remained uninjured. This, it was 
said, had formerly happened to <name type="person">Claudia Quinta</name>; her statue, which had twice 
escaped the violence of fire, had been dedicated by our ancestors in the 
<rs type="placename">temple of the Mother of Gods</rs>; hence the Claudii had been accounted sacred 
and numbered among deities, and so additional sanctity ought to be given to 
a spot where heaven showed such honour to the emperor.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>It will not be uninteresting to mention that <rs type="placename">Mount 
C&aelig;lius</rs> was anciently known by the name of <rs type="placename">Querquetulanus</rs>, because it 
grew oak timber in abundance and was afterwards called <rs type="placename">C&aelig;lius</rs> by 
<name type="person">C&aelig;les Vibenna</name>, who led the Etruscan people to the aid of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and had the place given him as a possession by 
<name type="person">Tarquinius Priscus</name> or by some other of the kings. As to that point 
historians differ; as to the rest, it is beyond a question that <name type="person">Vibenna</name>'s 
numerous forces established themselves in the plain beneath and in the 
neighbourhood of the forum, and that the Tuscan street was named after these 
strangers.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>But though the zeal of the 
nobles and the bounty of the prince brought relief to suffering, yet every 
day a stronger and fiercer host of informers pursued its victims, without 
one alleviating circumstance. <name type="person">Quintilius Varus</name>, a rich man and related to 
the emperor, was suddenly attacked by Domitius Afer, the successful 
prosecutor of <name type="person">Claudia Pulchra</name>, his mother, and no one wondered that the 
needy

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FIRE AT <rs type="placename">ROME</rs>; TIBERIUS TO <rs type="placename">CAPRI</rs></note>
adventurer of many years who had squandered 
his lately gotten recompense was now preparing himself for fresh iniquities. 
That <name type="person">Publius Dolabella</name> should have associated himself in the prosecution was 
a marvel, for he was of illustrious ancestry, was allied to <name type="person">Varus</name>, and was 
now himself seeking to destroy his own noble race, his own kindred. The 
Senate however stopped the proceeding, and decided to wait for the emperor, 
this being the only means of escaping for a time impending horrors.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p><name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, meanwhile, after dedicating the 
temples in <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>, warned the public by an edict 
not to disturb his retirement and posted soldiers here and there to keep off 
the throngs of townsfolk. But he so loathed the towns and colonies and, in 
short, every place on the mainland, that he buried himself in the island of 
<rs type="placename">Capre&aelig;</rs> which is separated by three miles of 
strait from the extreme point of the promontory of <rs type="placename">Sorrentum</rs>. The solitude 
of the place was, I believe, its chief attraction, for a harbourless sea 
surrounds it and even for a small vessel it has but few safe retreats, nor 
can any one land unknown to the sentries. Its air in winter is soft, as it 
is screened by a mountain which is a protection against cutting winds. In 
summer it catches the western breezes, and the open sea round it renders it 
most delightful. It commanded too a prospect of the most lovely bay, till 
<rs type="placename">Vesuvius</rs>, bursting into flames, changed the face of 
the country. <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, so tradition says, occupied those parts and <rs type="placename">Capre&aelig;</rs> was inhabited by the <name type="ethnic">Teleboi</name>. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> had 
by this time filled the island with twelve country houses, each with a grand 
name and a vast structure of its own. Intent as he had once been on the 
cares of state, he was now for thoroughly unbending himself in secret 
profligacy and a leisure of malignant schemes. For he still retained that 
rash proneness to suspect and to believe, which even at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> <name type="person">Sejanus</name> used to foster, and which he here excited 
more keenly, no longer concealing his machinations against <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and 
<name type="person">Nero</name>. Soldiers hung about them, and every message, every visit, their public 
and their private life were I may say regularly chronicled. And persons were 
actually suborned to advise them to flee to the armies of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, or when the Forum was most crowded, to clasp 
the statue of the

Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> and appeal to the protection of 
the people and Senate. These counsels they disdained, but they were charged 
with having had thoughts of acting on them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>The year of the consulship of <name type="person">Silanus</name> and <name type="person">Silius Nerva</name> opened 
with a foul beginning. A Roman knight of the highest rank, <name type="person">Titius Sabinus</name>, 
was dragged to prison because he had been a friend of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. He had 
indeed persisted in showing marked respect towards his wife and children, as 
their visitor at home, their companion in public, the solitary survivor of 
so many clients, and he was consequently esteemed by the good, as he was a 
terror to the evil-minded. <name type="person">Latinius Latiaris</name>, <name type="person">Porcius Cato</name>, <name type="person">Petitius Rufus</name>, 
and <name type="person">Marcus Opsius</name>, ex-pr&aelig;tors, conspired to attack him, with an eye to 
the consulship, to which there was access only through <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, and the good 
will of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> was to be gained only by a crime. They arranged amongst 
themselves that <name type="person">Latiaris</name>, who had some slight acquaintance with <name type="person">Sabinus</name>, 
should devise the plot, that the rest should be present as witnesses, and 
that then they should begin the prosecution. Accordingly <name type="person">Latiaris</name>, after 
first dropping some casual remarks, went on to praise the fidelity of 
<name type="person">Sabinus</name> in not having, like others, forsaken after its fall the house of 
which he had been the friend in its prosperity. He also spoke highly of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name> and compassionately of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>. <name type="person">Sabinus</name>, with the natural 
softness of the human heart under calamity, burst into tears, which he 
followed up with complaints, and soon with yet more daring invective against 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name>, against his cruelty, pride and ambition. He did not spare even 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> in his reproaches. That conversation, having united them, as it 
were, in an unlawful secret, led to a semblance of close intimacy. 
Henceforward <name type="person">Sabinus</name> himself sought <name type="person">Latiaris</name>, went continually to his house, 
and imparted to him his griefs, as to a most faithful friend.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p>The men whom I have named now consulted how these 
conversations might fall within the hearing of more persons. It was 
necessary that the place of meeting should preserve the appearance of 
secrecy, and, if witnesses were to stand behind the doors, there was a fear 
of their being seen or heard, or of suspicion casually arising. Three 
senators thrust themselves into the space between the roof and

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SABINUS, GERMANICUS' FRIEND, RUINED</note>
ceiling, a 
hiding-place as shameful as the treachery was execrable. They applied their 
ears to apertures and crevices. <name type="person">Latiaris</name> meanwhile having met <name type="person">Sabinus</name> in the 
streets, drew him to his house and to the room, as if he was going to 
communicate some fresh discoveries. There he talked much about past and 
impending troubles, a copious topic indeed, and about fresh horrors. <name type="person">Sabinus</name> 
spoke as before and at greater length, as sorrow, when once it has broken 
into utterance, is the harder to restrain. Instantly they hastened to accuse 
him, and having despatched a letter to the emperor, they informed him of the 
order of the plot and of their own infamy. Never was <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> more distracted and terror-stricken. Meetings, 
conversations, the ear of friend and stranger were alike shunned; even 
things mute and lifeless, the very roofs and walls, were eyed with 
suspicion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p>The emperor in his letter 
on the first of January, after offering the usual prayers for the new year, 
referred to <name type="person">Sabinus</name>, whom he reproached with having corrupted some of his 
freedmen and having attempted his life, and he claimed vengeance in no 
obscure language. It was decreed without hesitation, and the condemned man 
was dragged off, exclaiming as loudly as he could, with head covered and 
throat tightly bound, "that this was inaugurating the year; these were the 
victims slain to <name type="person">Sejanus</name>." Wherever he turned his eyes, wherever his words 
fell, there was flight and solitude; the streets and public places were 
forsaken. A few retraced their steps and again showed themselves, shuddering 
at the mere fact that they had betrayed alarm. "What day," they asked, "will 
be without some execution, when amid sacrifices and prayers, a time when it 
is usual to refrain even from a profane word, the chain and halter are 
introduced? <name type="person">Tiberius</name> has not incurred such odium blindly; this is a studied 
device to make us believe that there is no reason why the new magistrates 
should not open the dungeons as well as the temple and the altars." 
Thereupon there came a letter of thanks to them for having punished a bitter 
foe to the State, and the emperor further added that he had an anxious life, 
that he apprehended treachery from enemies, but he mentioned no one by name. 
Still there was no question that this was aimed at <name type="person">Nero</name> and 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>But for my plan 
of referring each event to its own year, I should feel a strong impulse to 
anticipate matters and at once relate the deaths by which <name type="person">Latinius</name> and 
<name type="person">Opsius</name> and the other authors of this atrocious deed perished, some after 
<name type="person">Caius</name> became emperor, some even while <name type="person">Tiberius</name> yet ruled. For although he 
would not have the instruments of his wickedness destroyed by others, he 
frequently, when he was tired of them, and fresh ones offered themselves for 
the same services, flung off the old, now become a mere incubus. But these 
and other punishments of guilty men I shall describe in due course. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name>, to whose children <name type="person">Agrippina</name> was aunt, then moved that 
the emperor should be requested to disclose his apprehensions to the Senate 
and allow their removal. Of all his virtues, as he counted them, there was 
none on which <name type="person">Tiberius</name> so prided himself as his ability to dissemble, and he 
was therefore the more irritated at an attempt to expose what he was hiding. 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name> however pacified him, not out of love for <name type="person">Gallus</name>, but rather to wait 
the result of the emperor's wavering mood, knowing, as he did, that, though 
slow in forming his purpose, yet having once broken through his reserve, he 
would follow up harsh words with terrible deeds. </p>
<p>About the same time 
<name type="person">Julia</name> died, the granddaughter of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. He had condemned her on a 
conviction of adultery and had banished her to the island of <rs type="placename">Trimerus</rs>, not far from the shores of <rs type="placename">Apulia</rs>. There she endured a twenty years' exile, in 
which she was supported by relief from <name type="person">Augusta</name>, who having overthrown the 
prosperity of her step-children by secret machinations, made open display of 
her compassion to the fallen family.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>That same year the <name type="ethnic">Frisii</name>, a nation beyond the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, cast off peace, more because of our rapacity than 
from their impatience of subjection. <name type="person">Drusus</name> had imposed on them a moderate 
tribute, suitable to their limited resources, the furnishing of ox hides for 
military purposes. No one ever severely scrutinized the size or thickness 
till <name type="person">Olennius</name>, a first-rank centurion, appointed to govern the <name type="ethnic">Frisii</name>, 
selected hides of wild bulls as the standard according to which they were to 
be supplied. This would have been hard for any

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">REVOLT OF 
FRISII SUPPRESSED</note>
nation, and it was the less tolerable to the 
<name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, whose forests abound in huge beasts, while their home cattle are 
undersized. First it was their herds, next their lands, last, the persons of 
their wives and children, which they gave up to bondage. Then came angry 
remonstrances, and when they received no relief, they sought a remedy in 
war. The soldiers appointed to collect the tribute were seized and gibbeted. 
<name type="person">Olennius</name> anticipated their fury by flight, and found refuge in a fortress, 
named <rs type="placename">Flevum</rs>, where a by no means contemptible force of <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> and allies 
kept guard over the shores of the ocean.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>As soon as this was known to <name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>, pro-pr&aelig;tor 
of <rs type="placename">Lower Germany</rs>, he summoned from the Upper 
province the legionary veterans, as well as some picked auxiliary infantry 
and cavalry. Instantly conveying both armies down the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, he threw them on the <name type="ethnic">Frisii</name>, raising at once the 
siege of the fortress and dispersing the rebels in defence of their own 
possessions. Next, he began constructing solid roads and bridges over the 
neighbouring estuaries for the passage of his heavy troops, and meanwhile 
having found a ford, he ordered the cavalry of the <name type="ethnic">Canninefates</name>, with all 
the <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> infantry which served with us, to take 
the enemy in the rear. Already in battle array, they were beating back our 
auxiliary horse as well as that of the legions sent to support them, when 
three light cohorts, then two more, and after a while the entire cavalry 
were sent to the attack. They were strong enough, had they charged 
altogether, but coming up, as they did, at intervals, they did not give 
fresh courage to the repulsed troops and were themselves carried away in the 
panic of the fugitives. <name type="person">Apronius</name> entrusted the rest of the auxiliaries to 
<name type="person">Cethegus Labeo</name>, the commander of the fifth legion, but he too, finding his 
men's position critical and being in extreme peril, sent messages imploring 
the whole strength of the legions. The soldiers of the fifth sprang forward, 
drove back the enemy in a fierce encounter, and saved our cohorts and 
cavalry, who were exhausted by their wounds. But the Roman general did not 
attempt vengeance or even bury the dead, although many tribunes, prefects, 
and first-rank centurions had fallen. Soon afterwards it was ascertained 
from deserters that nine

hundred <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had been cut to pieces in 
a wood called <rs type="placename">Braduhenna</rs>'s, after prolonging the fight to the next day, and 
that another body of four hundred, which had taken possession of the house 
of one <name type="person">Cruptorix</name>, once a soldier in our pay, fearing betrayal, had perished 
by mutual slaughter.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>The Frisian name 
thus became famous in <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, and <name type="person">Tiberius</name> kept our 
losses a secret, not wishing to entrust any one with the war. Nor did the 
Senate care whether dishonour fell on the extreme frontiers of the empire. 
Fear at home had filled their hearts, and for this they sought relief in 
sycophancy. And so, although their advice was asked on totally different 
subjects, they decreed an altar to Clemency, an altar to Friendship, and 
statues round them to <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> and <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, both of whom they earnestly 
begged with repeated entreaties to allow themselves to be seen in public. 
Still, neither of them would visit <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> or even the 
neighbourhood of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>; they thought it enough to 
quit the island and show themselves on the opposite shores of <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>. Senators, knights, a number of the city 
populace flocked thither, anxiously looking to <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, approach to whom was 
particularly difficult and was consequently sought by intrigue and by 
complicity in his counsels. It was sufficiently clear that his arrogance was 
increased by gazing on this foul and openly displayed servility. At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> indeed hurrying crowds are a familiar sight, and 
from the extent of the city no one knows on what business each citizen is 
bent; but there, as they lounged in promiscuous crowds in the fields or on 
the shore, they had to bear day and night alike the patronising smiles and 
the supercilious insolence of hall-porters, till even this was forbidden 
them, and those whom <name type="person">Sejanus</name> had not deigned to accost or to look on, 
returned to the capital in alarm, while some felt an evil joy, though there 
hung over them the dreadful doom of that ill-starred friendship.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> meanwhile having himself in person 
bestowed the hand of his granddaughter <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s daughter, on 
<name type="person">Cneius Domitius</name>, directed the marriage to be celebrated at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. In selecting <name type="person">Domitius</name> he looked not only to his 
ancient lineage, but also to his alliance with the blood of the 
C&aelig;sars, for he could point to <name type="person">Octavia</name> as his grandmother and through 
her to <name type="person">Augustus</name> as his great-uncle.</p></div2></div1>

surname <name type="person">Geminus</name>, died in an advanced old age <name type="person">Julia Augusta</name>. A <name type="person">Claudia</name> by 
birth and by adoption a <name type="person">Livia</name> and a <name type="person">Julia</name>, she united the noblest blood of 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Her first marriage, by which she had children, 
was with <name type="person">Tiberius Nero</name>, who, an exile during the Perusian war, returned to 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> when peace had been concluded between <name type="person">Sextus 
Pompeius</name> and the triumvirs. After this <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, enamoured of her beauty, 
took her away from her husband, whether against her wish is uncertain. So 
impatient was he that he brought her to his house actually pregnant, not 
allowing time for her confinement. She had no subsequent issue, but allied 
as she was through the marriage of <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and <name type="person">Germanicus</name> to the blood of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, her great-grandchildren were also his. In the purity of her home 
life she was of the ancient type, but was more gracious than was thought 
fitting in ladies of former days. An imperious mother and an amiable wife, 
she was a match for the diplomacy of her husband and the dissimulation of 
her son. Her funeral was simple, and her will long remained unexecuted. Her 
panegyric was pronounced from the <rs type="placename">Rostra</rs> by her great-grandson, <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;sar</name>, who afterwards succeeded to power.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name> however, making no change in his voluptuous life, excused 
himself by letter for his absence from his last duty to his mother on the 
ground of the pressure of business. He even abridged, out of moderation, as 
it seemed, the honours which the Senate had voted on a lavish scale to her 
memory, allowing only a very few, and adding that no religious worship was 
to be decreed, this having been her own wish. In a part of the same letter 
he sneered at female friendships, with an indirect censure on the consul 
<name type="person">Fufius</name>,

who had risen to distinction through <name type="person">Augusta</name>'s 
partiality. <name type="person">Fufius</name> was indeed a man well fitted to win the affection of a 
woman; he was witty too, and accustomed to ridicule <name type="person">Tiberius</name> with those 
bitter jests which the powerful remember so long.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>This at all events was the beginning of an unmitigated and 
grinding despotism. As long indeed as <name type="person">Augusta</name> lived, there yet remained a 
refuge, for with <name type="person">Tiberius</name> obedience to his mother was the habit of a life, 
and <name type="person">Sejanus</name> did not dare to set himself above a parent's authority. Now, so 
to say, they threw off the reins and let loose their fury. A letter was 
sent, directed against <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and <name type="person">Nero</name>, which was popularly believed to 
have been long before forwarded and to have been kept back by <name type="person">Augusta</name>, as it 
was publicly read soon after her death. It contained expressions of studied 
harshness, yet it was not armed rebellion or a longing for revolution, but 
unnatural passions and profligacy which the emperor imputed to his grandson. 
Against his daughter-in-law he did not dare to invent this much; he merely 
censured her insolent tongue and defiant spirit, amid the panic-stricken 
silence of the Senate, till a few who had no hope from merit (and public 
calamities are ever used by individuals for interested purposes) demanded 
that the question should be debated. The most eager was <name type="person">Cotta Messalinus</name>, 
who made a savage speech. Still, the other principal senators, and 
especially the magistrates, were perplexed, for <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, notwithstanding 
his furious invective, had left everything else in doubt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>There was in the Senate one <name type="person">Junius Rusticus</name>, who 
having been appointed by the emperor to register its debates was therefore 
supposed to have an insight into his secret purposes. This man, whether 
through some fatal impulse (he had indeed never before given any evidence of 
courage) or a misdirected acuteness which made him tremble at the uncertain 
future, while he forgot impending perils, attached himself to the waverers, 
and warned the consuls not to enter on the debate. He argued that the 
highest issues turned on trivial causes, and that the fall of the house of 
Germanicus might one day move the old man's remorse. At the same moment the 
people, bearing the images of <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TIBERIUS' TYRANNY INTENSIFIED</note>
<name type="person">Nero</name>, thronged round the <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs>, and, with 
words of blessing on the emperor, kept shouting that the letter was a 
forgery and that it was not by the prince's will that ruin was being plotted 
against his house. And so that day passed without any dreadful result. 
</p>
<p>Fictitious speeches too against <name type="person">Sejanus</name> were published under the names 
of ex-consuls, for several persons indulged, all the more recklessly because 
anonymously, the caprice of their imaginations. Consequently the wrath of 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name> was the more furious, and he had ground for alleging that the Senate 
disregarded the emperor's trouble; that the people were in revolt; that 
speeches in a new style and new resolutions were being heard and read. What 
remained but to take the sword and chose for their generals and emperors 
those whose images they had followed as standards.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>Upon this the emperor, after repeating his invectives 
against his grandson and his daughter-in-law and reprimanding the populace 
in an edict, complained to the Senate that by the trick of one senator the 
imperial dignity had been publicly flouted, and he insisted that, after all, 
the whole matter should be left to his exclusive decision. Without further 
deliberation, they proceeded, not indeed to pronounce the final sentence 
(for this was forbidden), but to declare that they were prepared for 
vengeance, and were restrained only by the strong hand of the sovereign. 

<note type="ed" anchored="yes"><p>[The remainder of the fifth book and the beginning of the 
sixth, recounting <name type="person">Sejanus</name>' marriage and fall and covering a space of nearly 
three years, are lost. Newer editions of <name type="person">Tacitus</name> mark the division between 
the fifth and sixth books at this point rather than at the end of section 
11; but references are regularly made to the older numbering, and so it has 
been retained here. The beginning of section 6 is obviously 
fragmentary.]</p></note></p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p> . . . forty-four 
speeches were delivered on this subject, a few of which were prompted by 
fear, most by the habit of flattery....

"There is now a 
change of fortune, and even he who chose <name type="person">Sejanus</name> to be his colleague and his 
son-in-law excuses his
 
error. As for the rest, the man whom they 
encouraged by shameful baseness, they now wickedly revile. Which is the most 
pitiable, to be accused for friendship's sake or to have to accuse a friend, 
I cannot decide. I will not put any man's cruelty or compassion to the test, 
but, while I am free and have a clear conscience, I will anticipate peril. I 
implore you to cherish my memory with joy rather than with sorrow, numbering 
me too with those who by a noble death have fled from the miseries of our 
country."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>Then detaining those of his 
friends who were minded to stay with him and converse, or, if otherwise, 
dismissing them, he thus spent part of the day, and with a numerous circle 
yet round him, all gazing on his fearless face, and imagining that there was 
still time to elapse before the last scene, he fell on a sword which he had 
concealed in his robe. The emperor did not pursue him after his death with 
either accusation or reproach, although he had heaped a number of foul 
charges on <name type="person">Bl&aelig;sus</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>Next were 
discussed the cases of <name type="person">Publius Vitellius</name> and <name type="person">Pomponius Secundus</name>. The first 
was charged by his accusers with having offered the keys of the treasury, of 
which he was prefect, and the military chest in aid of a revolution. Against 
the latter, <name type="person">Considius</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, alleged intimacy with <name type="person">&AElig;lius 
Gallus</name>, who, after the punishment of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, had fled to the gardens of 
<name type="person">Pomponius</name>, as his safest refuge. They had no resource in their peril but in 
the courageous firmness of their brothers who became their sureties. Soon, 
after several adjournments, <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, weary alike of hope and fear, asked 
for a penknife, avowedly, for his literary pursuits, and inflicted a slight 
wound in his veins, and died at last of a broken heart. <name type="person">Pomponius</name>, a man of 
refined manners and brilliant genius, bore his adverse fortune with 
resignation, and outlived <name type="person">Tiberius</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>It 
was next decided to punish the remaining children of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, though the 
fury of the populace was subsiding, and people generally had been appeased 
by the previous executions. Accordingly they were carried off to prison, the 
boy, aware of his impending doom, and the little girl, who was so 
unconscious that she continually asked what was her offence, and whither she 
was being dragged, saying that she
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SEJANUS' CONNECTIONS 
PROSECUTED</note>
would do so no more, and a childish chastisement was 
enough for her correction. Historians of the time tell us that, as there was 
no precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, she was violated by the 
executioner, with the rope on her neck. Then they were strangled and their 
bodies, mere children as they were, were flung down the 
<rs type="placename">Gemoni&aelig;</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>About the same time 
<rs type="placename">Asia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs> were alarmed 
by a prevalent but short-lived rumour that <name type="person">Drusus</name>, the son of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, 
had been seen in the <rs type="placename">Cyclades</rs> and subsequently on 
the mainland. There was indeed a young man of much the same age, whom some 
of the emperor's freedmen pretended to recognise, and to whom they attached 
themselves with a treacherous intent. The renown of the name attracted the 
ignorant, and the Greek mind eagerly fastens on what is new and marvellous. 
The story indeed, which they no sooner invented than believed, was that 
<name type="person">Drusus</name> had escaped from custody, and was on his way to the armies of his 
father, with the design of invading <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> or <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. And he was now drawing to himself a multitude of 
young men and much popular enthusiasm, enjoying the present and cherishing 
idle hopes of the future, when <name type="person">Popp&aelig;us Sabinus</name> heard of the affair. At 
the time he was chiefly occupied with <rs type="placename">Macedonia</rs>, but 
he also had the charge of <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs>. So, to forestall 
the danger, let the story be true or false, he hurried by the bays of <rs type="placename">Torone</rs> and <rs type="placename">Therm&aelig;</rs>, then 
passed on to <rs type="placename">Eub&oelig;a</rs>, an island of the <rs type="placename">&AElig;g&aelig;an</rs>, to <rs type="placename">Pir&aelig;us</rs>, on the coast of <rs type="placename">Attica</rs>, thence to the shores of <rs type="placename">Corinth</rs> and the narrow <rs type="placename">Isthmus</rs>, 
and having arrived by the other sea at <rs type="placename">Nicopolis</rs>, a 
Roman colony, he there at last ascertained that the man, when skilfully 
questioned, had said that he was the son of <name type="person">Marcus Silanus</name>, and that, after 
the dispersion of a number of his followers, he had embarked on a vessel, 
intending, it seemed, to go to <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. <name type="person">Sabinus</name> sent 
this account to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and of the origin and issue of the affair nothing 
more is known to me.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>At the close of 
the year a long growing feud between the consuls broke out. <name type="person">Trio</name>, a reckless 
man in incurring enmities and a practised lawyer, had indirectly censured 
<name type="person">Regulus</name> as having been half-hearted in crushing the satellites of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>. 
<name type="person">Regulus</name>, who, unless he was provoked, loved
 
quietness, not only 
repulsed his colleague's attack, but was for dragging him to trial as a 
guilty accomplice in the conspiracy. And though many of the senators 
implored them to compose a quarrel likely to end fatally, they continued 
their enmity and their mutual menaces till they retired from 
office.</p></div2></div1>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p><name type="person">CNEIUS Domitius</name> and <name type="person">Camillus Scribonianus </name>had entered on the 
consulship when the emperor, after crossing the channel which divides <rs type="placename">Capre&aelig;</rs> from <rs type="placename">Surrentum</rs>, 
sailed along <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>, in doubt whether he should 
enter <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, or, possibly, simulating the intention 
of going thither, because he had resolved otherwise. He often landed at 
points in the neighbourhood, visited the gardens by the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, but went back again to the cliffs and to the 
solitude of the sea shores, in shame at the vices and profligacies into 
which he had plunged so unrestrainedly that in the fashion of a despot he 
debauched the children of free-born citizens. It was not merely beauty and a 
handsome person which he felt as an incentive to his lust, but the modesty 
of childhood in some, and noble ancestry in others. Hitherto unknown terms 
were then for the first time invented, derived from the abominations of the 
place and the endless phases of sensuality. Slaves too were set over the 
work of seeking out and procuring, with rewards for the willing and threats 
to the reluctant, and if there was resistance from a relative or a parent, 
they used violence and force, and actually indulged their own passions as if 
dealing with captives.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile, in the beginning of the year, as if 
<name type="person">Livia</name>'s crimes had just been discovered and not also long ago punished, 
terrible decrees were proposed against her very statues and memory, and the 
property of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> was to be taken from the exchequer and transferred to 
the imperial treasury, as if there was any difference. The motion was being 
urged with extreme persistency, in almost the same or with but slightly 
changed language, by such men as <name type="person">Scipio</name>, <name type="person">Silanus</name>, and <name type="person">Cassius</name>, when suddenly 
<name type="person">Togonius Gallus</name> intruding his own obscurity among illustrious names, was

heard with ridicule. He begged the emperor to select a number of 
senators, twenty out of whom should be chosen by lot to wear swords and to 
defend his person, whenever he entered the Senate House. The man had 
actually believed a letter from him in which he asked the protection of one 
of the consuls, so that he might go in safety from <rs type="placename">Capre&aelig;</rs> to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
however, who usually combined jesting and seriousness, thanked the senators 
for their goodwill, but asked who could be rejected, who could be chosen? 
"Were they always to be the same, or was there to be a succession? Were they 
to be men who had held office or youths, private citizens or officials? 
Then, again, what a scene would be presented by persons grasping their 
swords on the threshold of the <rs type="placename">Senate House</rs>? His life was not of so much 
worth if it had to be defended by arms." This was his answer to <name type="person">Togonius</name>, 
guarded in its expression, and he urged nothing beyond the rejection of the 
motion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p><name type="person">Junius Gallio</name> however, who had 
proposed that the pr&aelig;torian soldiers, after having served their 
campaigns, should acquire the privilege of sitting in the fourteen rows of 
the theatre, received a savage censure. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, just as if he were face to 
face with him, asked what <emph>he</emph> had to do with the soldiers, who ought 
not to receive the emperor's orders or his rewards except from the emperor 
himself? He had really discovered something which the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> had 
not foreseen. Or was not one of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>'s satellites rather seeking to sow 
discord and sedition, as a means of prompting ignorant minds, under the 
pretence of compliment, to ruin military discipline? This was <name type="person">Gallio</name>'s 
recompense for his carefully prepared flattery, with immediate expulsion 
from the Senate, and then from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. And as men 
complained that he would endure his exile with equanimity, since he had 
chosen the famous and lovely island of <rs type="placename">Lesbos</rs>, he 
was dragged back to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and confined in the houses 
of different officials. </p>
<p>The emperor in the same letter crushed <name type="person">Sextius 
Paconianus</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, to the great joy of the senators, as he was 
a daring, mischievous man, who pryed into every person's secrets, and had 
been the chosen instrument of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> in his treacherous designs against 
<name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>. When this

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TIBERIUS 
VINDICTIVE</note>
fact was divulged, there came an outburst of 
long-concealed hatreds, and there must have been a sentence of capital 
punishment, had he not himself volunteered a disclosure.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>As soon as he named <name type="person">Latinius Latiaris</name>, accuser and 
accused, both alike objects of execration, presented a most welcome 
spectacle. <name type="person">Latiaris</name>, as I have related, had been foremost in contriving the 
ruin of <name type="person">Titius Sabinus</name>, and was now the first to pay the penalty. By way of 
episode, <name type="person">Haterius Agrippa</name> inveighed against the consuls of the previous year 
for now sitting silent after their threats of impeaching one another. "It 
must be fear," he said, "and a guilty conscience which are acting as a bond 
of union. But the senators must not keep back what they have heard." <name type="person">Regulus</name> 
replied that he was awaiting the opportunity for vengeance, and meant to 
press it in the emperor's presence. <name type="person">Trio</name>'s answer was that it was best to 
efface the memory of rivalries between colleagues, and of any words uttered 
in quarrels. When <name type="person">Agrippa</name> still persisted, <name type="person">Sanquinius Maximus</name>, one of the 
ex-consuls, implored the Senate not to increase the emperor's anxieties by 
seeking further occasions of bitterness, as he was himself competent to 
provide remedies. This secured the safety of <name type="person">Regulus</name> and the postponement of 
<name type="person">Trio</name>'s ruin. <name type="person">Haterius</name> was hated all the more. Wan with untimely slumbers and 
nights of riot, and not fearing in his indolence even the cruellest of 
princes, he yet plotted amid his gluttony and lust the destruction of 
illustrious men.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>Several charges were 
next brought, as soon as the opportunity offered, against <name type="person">Cotta Messalinus</name>, 
the author of every unusually cruel proposal, and consequently, regarded 
with inveterate hatred. He had spoken, it was said, of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, as 
if it were a question whether he was a man, and of an entertainment at which 
he was present on <name type="person">Augusta</name>'s birthday with the priests, as a funeral banquet. 
In remonstrating too against the influence of <name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name> and <name type="person">Lucius 
Arruntius</name>, with whom he had disputes on many matters, he had added the 
remark, "They will have the Senate's support; I shall have that of my 
darling <name type="person">Tiberius</name>." But the leading men of the State failed to convict him on 
all the charges. When they pressed the case, he appealed to the emperor. 
Soon afterwards, a letter arrived, in which <name type="person">Tiberius</name>

traced the 
origin of the friendship between himself and <name type="person">Cotta</name>, enumerated his frequent 
services, and then requested that words perversely misrepresented and the 
freedom of table talk might not be construed into a crime.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>The beginning of the emperor's letter seemed very 
striking. It opened thus: "May all the gods and goddesses destroy me more 
miserably than I feel myself to be daily perishing, if I know at this moment 
what to write to you, Senators, how to write it, or what, in short, not to 
write." So completely had his crimes and infamies recoiled, as a penalty, on 
himself. With profound meaning was it often affirmed by the greatest teacher 
of philosophy that, could the minds of tyrants be laid bare, there would be 
seen gashes and wounds; for, as the body is lacerated by scourging, so is 
the spirit by brutality, by lust and by evil thoughts. Assuredly <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
was not saved by his elevation or his solitude from having to confess the 
anguish of his heart and his self-inflicted punishment.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>Authority was then given to the Senate to decide the 
case of <name type="person">C&aelig;cilianus</name>, one of its members, the chief witness against 
<name type="person">Cotta</name>, and it was agreed that the same penalty should be inflicted as on 
<name type="person">Aruseius</name> and <name type="person">Sanquinius</name>, the accusers of <name type="person">Lucius Arruntius</name>. Nothing ever 
happened to <name type="person">Cotta</name> more to his distinction. Of noble birth, but beggared by 
extravagance and infamous for his excesses, he was now by the dignity of his 
revenge, raised to a level with the stainless virtues of <name type="person">Arruntius</name>. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">Quintus Serv&aelig;us</name> and <name type="person">Minucius Thermus</name> were next arraigned. 
<name type="person">Serv&aelig;us</name> was an ex-pr&aelig;tor, and had formerly been a companion of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>; <name type="person">Minucius</name> was of equestrian rank, and both had enjoyed, though 
discreetly, the friendship of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>. Hence they were the more pitied. 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> on the contrary, denounced them as foremost in crime, and bade 
<name type="person">Caius Cestius</name>, the elder, tell the Senate what he had communicated to the 
emperor by letter. <name type="person">Cestius</name> undertook the prosecution. And this was the most 
dreadful feature of the age, that leading members of the Senate, some 
openly, some secretly employed themselves in the very lowest work of the 
informer. One could not distinguish between aliens and kinsfolk, between 
friends and strangers, or say what

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROSECUTIONS OF SEJANUS' 
FRIENDS</note>
was quite recent, or what half-forgotten from lapse of time. 
People were incriminated for some casual remark in the forum or at the 
dinner-table, for every one was impatient to be the first to mark his 
victim, some to screen themselves, most from being, as it were, infected 
with the contagion of the malady. </p>
<p><name type="person">Minucius</name> and <name type="person">Serv&aelig;us</name>, on being 
condemned, went over to the prosecution, and then <name type="person">Julius Africanus</name> with 
<name type="person">Seius Quadratus</name> were dragged into the same ruin. <name type="person">Africanus</name> was from the 
<name type="ethnic">Santones</name>, one of the states of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>; the origin of 
<name type="person">Quadratus</name> I have not ascertained. Many authors, I am well aware, have passed 
over the perils and punishments of a host of persons, sickened by the 
multiplicity of them, or fearing that what they had themselves found 
wearisome and saddening, would be equally fatiguing to their readers. For 
myself, I have lighted on many facts worth knowing, though other writers 
have not recorded them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>A Roman knight, 
<name type="person">Marcus Terentius</name>, at the crisis where all others had hypocritically 
repudiated the friendship of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, dared, when impeached on that ground, 
to cling to it by the following avowal to the Senate: "In my position it is 
perhaps less to my advantage to acknowledge than to deny the charge. Still, 
whatever is to be the issue of the matter, I shall admit that I was the 
friend of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, that I anxiously sought to be such, and was delighted 
when I was successful. I had seen him his father's colleague in the command 
of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts, and subsequently combining the duties of 
civil and military life. His kinsfolk and connections were loaded with 
honours; intimacy with <name type="person">Sejanus</name> was in every case a powerful recommendation 
to the emperor's friendship. Those, on the contrary, whom he hated, had to 
struggle with danger and humiliation. I take no individual as an instance. 
All of us who had no part in his last design, I mean to defend at the peril 
of myself alone. It was really not <name type="person">Sejanus</name> of <rs type="placename">Vulsinii</rs>, it was a member of the Claudian and <placeName key="tgn,2118773">Julian</placeName> 
houses, in which he had taken a position by his marriage-alliance, it was 
your son-in-law, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, your partner in the consulship, the man who 
administered your political functions, whom we courted. It is not for us to 
criticise one whom you may raise above all others, or

your 
motives for so doing. Heaven has intrusted you with the supreme decision of 
affairs, and for us is left the glory of obedience. And, again, we see what 
takes place before our eyes, who it is on whom you bestow riches and 
honours, who are the most powerful to help or to injure. That <name type="person">Sejanus</name> was 
such, no one will deny. To explore the prince's secret thoughts, or any of 
his hidden plans, is a forbidden, a dangerous thing, nor does it follow that 
one could reach them. </p>
<p>"Do not, Senators, think only of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>'s last 
day, but of his sixteen years of power. We actually adored a <name type="person">Satrius</name> and a 
<name type="person">Pomponius</name>. To be known even to his freedmen and hall-porters was thought 
something very grand. What then is my meaning? Is this apology meant to be 
offered for all without difference and discrimination? No; it is to be 
restricted within proper limits. Let plots against the State, murderous 
designs against the emperor be punished. As for friendship and its 
obligations, the same principle must acquit both you, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, and 
us."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>The courage of this speech and the 
fact that there had been found a man to speak out what was in all people's 
thoughts, had such an effect that the accusers of <name type="person">Terentius</name> were sentenced 
to banishment or death, their previous offences being taken into account. 
Then came a letter from <name type="person">Tiberius</name> against <name type="person">Sextus Vestilius</name>, an 
ex-pr&aelig;tor, whom, as a special favourite of his brother <name type="person">Drusus</name>, the 
emperor had admitted into his own select circle. His reason for being 
displeased with <name type="person">Vestilius</name> was that he had either written an attack on <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;sar</name> as a profligate, or that <name type="person">Tiberius</name> believed a false charge. For 
this <name type="person">Vestilius</name> was excluded from the prince's table. He then tried the knife 
with his aged hand, but again bound up his veins, opening them once more 
however on having begged for pardon by letter and received a pitiless 
answer. After him a host of persons were charged with treason, <name type="person">Annius 
Pollio</name>, <name type="person">Appius Silanus Scaurus</name>, <name type="person">Mamercus</name>, <name type="person">Sabinus Calvisius</name>, <name type="person">Vinicianus</name> too, 
coupled with <name type="person">Pollio</name>, his father, men all of illustrious descent, some too of 
the highest political distinction. The senators were panic-stricken, for how 
few of their number were not connected by alliance or by friendship with 
this multitude of men of rank! <name type="person">Celsus</name> however, tribune of a city cohort, and 
now

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FURTHER PROSECUTIONS</note>
one of the prosecutors, 
saved <name type="person">Appius</name> and <name type="person">Calvisius</name> from the peril. The emperor postponed the cases 
of <name type="person">Pollio</name>, <name type="person">Vinicianus</name>, and <name type="person">Scaurus</name>, intending to try them himself with the 
Senate, not however without affixing some ominous marks to the name of 
<name type="person">Scaurus</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>Even women were not exempt 
from danger. Where they could not be accused of grasping at political power, 
their tears were made a crime. <name type="person">Vitia</name>, an aged woman, mother of <name type="person">Fufius 
Geminus</name>, was executed for bewailing the death of her son. Such were the 
proceedings in the Senate. It was the same with the emperor. <name type="person">Vescularius 
Atticus</name> and <name type="person">Julius Marinus</name> were hurried off to execution, two of his oldest 
friends, men who had followed him to <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs> and been his inseparable companions at <rs type="placename">Capre&aelig;</rs>. 
<name type="person">Vescularius</name> was his agent in the plot against <name type="person">Libo</name>, and it was with the 
co-operation of <name type="person">Marinus</name> that <name type="person">Sejanus</name> had ruined <name type="person">Curtius Atticus</name>. Hence there 
was all the more joy at the recoil of these precedents on their authors. 
</p>
<p>About the same time <name type="person">Lucius Piso</name>, the pontiff, died a natural death, a 
rare incident in so high a rank. Never had he by choice proposed a servile 
motion, and, whenever necessity was too strong for him, he would suggest 
judicious compromises. His father, as I have related, had been a censor. He 
lived to the advanced age of eighty, and had won in <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs> the honour of a triumph. But his chief glory rested on the wonderful tact 
with which as city-prefect he handled an authority, recently made perpetual 
and all the more galling to men unaccustomed to obey it.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>In former days, when the kings and subsequently the 
chief magistrates went from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, an official was 
temporarily chosen to administer justice and provide for emergencies, so 
that the capital might not be left without government. It is said that 
<name type="person">Denter Romulius</name> was appointed by <name type="person">Romulus</name>, then <name type="person">Numa Marcius</name> by <name type="person">Tullus 
Hostilius</name>, and <name type="person">Spurius Lucretius</name> by <name type="person">Tarquinius Superbus</name>. Afterwards, the 
consuls made the appointment. The shadow of the old practice still survives, 
whenever in consequence of the Latin festival some one is deputed to 
exercise the consul's functions. And <name type="person">Augustus</name> too during the civil wars gave 
<name type="person">Cilnius M&aelig;cenas</name>. a Roman knight, charge of everything in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>

and <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. When 
he rose to supreme power, in consideration of the magnitude of the State and 
the slowness of legal remedies, he selected one of the ex-consuls to overawe 
the slaves and that part of the population which, unless it fears a strong 
hand, is disorderly and reckless. <name type="person">Messala Corvinus</name> was the first to obtain 
the office, which he lost within a few days, as not knowing how to discharge 
it. After him <name type="person">Taurus Statilius</name>, though in advanced years, sustained it 
admirably; and then <name type="person">Piso</name>, after twenty years of similar credit, was, by the 
Senate's decree, honoured with a public funeral.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>A motion was next brought forward in the Senate by <name type="person">Quintilianus</name>, 
a tribune of the people, respecting an alleged book of the <placeName key="tgn,2662097">Sibyl</placeName>. <name type="person">Caninius 
Gallus</name>, a member of the College of the Fifteen, had asked that it might be 
received among the other volumes of the same prophetess by a decree on the 
subject. This having been carried by a division, the emperor sent a letter 
in which he gently censured the tribune, as ignorant of ancient usage 
because of his youth. <name type="person">Gallus</name> he scolded for having introduced the matter in 
a thin Senate, notwithstanding his long experience in the science of 
religious ceremonies, without taking the opinion of the College or having 
the verses read and criticised, as was usual, by its presidents, though 
their authenticity was very doubtful. He also reminded him that, as many 
spurious productions were current under a celebrated name, <name type="person">Augustus</name> had 
prescribed a day within which they should be deposited with the 
city-pr&aelig;tor, and after which it should not be lawful for any private 
person to hold them. The same regulations too had been made by our ancestors 
after the burning of the Capitol in the social war, when there was a search 
throughout <rs type="placename">Samos</rs>, 
<rs type="placename">Ilium</rs>, 
<rs type="placename">Erythr&aelig;</rs>, 
and even in <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, 
<rs type="placename">Sicily</rs> and the Italian colonies for the verses of the <placeName key="tgn,2662097">Sibyl</placeName> (whether there were but one or more) and the priests were charged with the business of 
distinguishing, as far as they could by human means, what were genuine. 
Accordingly the book in question was now also submitted to the scrutiny of 
the College of the Fifteen.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>During 
the same consulship a high price of corn almost brought on an insurrection. 
For several days there were many clamorous demands made in the theatre with 
an

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">A NEW SIBYLLINE BOOK</note>
unusual freedom of language 
towards the emperor. This provoked him to censure the magistrates and the 
Senate for not having used the authority of the State to put down the 
people. He named too the corn-supplying provinces, and dwelt on the far 
larger amount of grain imported by himself than by <name type="person">Augustus</name>. So the Senate 
drew up a decree in the severe spirit of antiquity, and the consuls issued a 
not less stringent proclamation. The emperor's silence was not, as he had 
hoped, taken as a proof of patriotism, but of pride.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>At the year's close <name type="person">Geminius</name>, <name type="person">Celsus</name> and <name type="person">Pompeius</name>, 
Roman knights, fell beneath a charge of conspiracy. Of these, <name type="person">Caius 
Geminius</name>, by lavish expenditure and a luxurious life, had been a friend of 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name>, but with no serious result. <name type="person">Julius Celsus</name>, a tribune, while in 
confinement, loosened his chain, and having twisted it around him, broke his 
neck by throwing himself in an opposite direction. <name type="person">Rubrius Fabatus</name> was put 
under surveillance, on a suspicion that, in despair of the fortunes of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, he meant to throw himself on the mercy of the 
<name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>. He was, at any rate, found near the <rs type="placename">Straits of Sicily</rs>, and, when dragged back by a centurion, he assigned no adequate reason for his long journey. Still, he lived on in safety, thanks to forgetfulness 
rather than to mercy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>In the 
consulship of <name type="person">Servius Galba</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Sulla</name>, the emperor, after having long 
considered whom he was to choose to be husbands for his granddaughters, now 
that the maidens were of marriageable age, selected <name type="person">Lucius Cassius</name> and 
<name type="person">Marcus Vinicius</name>. <name type="person">Vinicius</name> was of provincial descent; he was born at <rs type="placename">Cales</rs>, 
his father and grandfather having been consuls, and his family, on the other 
side, being of the rank of knights. He was a man of amiable temper and of 
cultivated eloquence. <name type="person">Cassius</name> was of an ancient and honourable, though 
plebeian house, at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Though he was brought up by 
his father under a severe training, he won esteem more frequently by his 
good-nature than by his diligence. To him and to <name type="person">Vinicius</name> the emperor 
married respectively <name type="person">Drusilla</name> and <name type="person">Julia</name>, <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s daughters, and 
addressed a letter on the subject to the Senate, with a slightly 
complimentary mention of the young men. He next assigned

some 
very vague reasons for his absence, then passed to more important matters, 
the ill-will against him originating in his state policy, and requested that 
<name type="person">Macro</name>, who commanded the pr&aelig;torians, with a few tribunes and 
centurions, might accompany him whenever he entered the <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs>. But 
though a decree was voted by the Senate on a liberal scale and without any 
restrictions as to rank or numbers, he never so much as went near the walls 
of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, much less the State-council, for he would 
often go round and avoid his native city by circuitous routes.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>Meanwhile a powerful host of accusers fell with 
sudden fury on the class which systematically increased its wealth by usury 
in defiance of a law passed by <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> the Dictator defining the terms 
of lending money and of holding estates in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, a 
law long obsolete because the public good is sacrificed to private interest. 
The curse of usury was indeed of old standing in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and a most frequent cause of sedition and discord, 
and it was therefore repressed even in the early days of a less corrupt 
morality. First, the Twelve Tables prohibited any one from exacting more 
than 10 per cent., when, previously, the rate had depended on the caprice of 
the wealthy. Subsequently, by a bill brought in by the tribunes, interest 
was reduced to half that amount, and finally compound interest was wholly 
forbidden. A check too was put by several enactments of the people on 
evasions which, though continually put down, still, through strange 
artifices, reappeared. On this occasion, however, <name type="person">Gracchus</name>, the 
pr&aelig;tor, to whose jurisdiction the inquiry had fallen, felt himself 
compelled by the number of persons endangered to refer the matter to the 
Senate. In their dismay the senators, not one of whom was free from similar 
guilt, threw themselves on the emperor's indulgence. He yielded, and a year 
and six months were granted, within which every one was to settle his 
private accounts conformably to the requirements of the law.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>Hence followed a scarcity of money, a great shock 
being given to all credit, the current coin too, in consequence of the 
conviction of so many persons and the sale of their property, being locked 
up in the imperial treasury or the public exchequer. To meet this, the 
Senate had directed that

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FINANCIAL CRISIS</note>
every 
creditor should have two-thirds of his capital secured on estates in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. Creditors however were suing for payment in full, 
and it was not respectable for persons when sued to break faith. So, at 
first, there were clamorous meetings and importunate entreaties; then noisy 
applications to the pr&aelig;tor's court. And the very device intended as a 
remedy, the sale and purchase of estates, proved the contrary, as the 
usurers had hoarded up all their money for buying land. The facilities for 
selling were followed by a fall of prices, and the deeper a man was in debt, 
the more reluctantly did he part with his property, and many were utterly 
ruined. The destruction of private wealth precipitated the fall of rank and 
reputation, till at last the emperor interposed his aid by distributing 
throughout the banks a hundred million sesterces, and allowing freedom to 
borrow without interest for three years, provided the borrower gave security 
to the State in land to double the amount. Credit was thus restored, and 
gradually private lenders were found. The purchase too of estates was not 
carried out according to the letter of the Senate's decree, rigour at the 
outset, as usual with such matters, becoming negligence in the 
end.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>Former alarms then returned, as 
there was a charge of treason against <name type="person">Considius Proculus</name>. While he was 
celebrating his birthday without a fear, he was hurried before the Senate, 
condemned and instantly put to death. His sister <name type="person">Sancia</name> was outlawed, on the 
accusation of <name type="person">Quintus Pomponius</name>, a restless spirit, who pretended that he 
employed himself in this and like practices to win favour with the 
sovereign, and thereby alleviate the perils hanging over his brother 
<name type="person">Pomponius Secundus</name>. </p>
<p><name type="person">Pompeia Macrina</name> too was sentenced to banishment. Her 
husband <name type="person">Argolicus</name> and her father-in-law <name type="person">Laco</name>, leading men of <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs>, had been ruined by the emperor. Her father 
likewise, an illustrious Roman knight, and her brother, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, 
seeing their doom was near, destroyed themselves. It was imputed to them as 
a crime that their great-grandfather <name type="person">Theophanes</name> of <rs type="placename">Mitylene</rs> had been one of the intimate friends of <name type="person">Pompey</name> 
the Great, and that after his death Greek flattery had paid him divine 
honours.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p><name type="person">Sextus Marius</name>, the richest 
man in <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>, was next ac-

cused of incest with his daughter, and thrown headlong from the <rs type="placename">Tarpeian rock</rs>. To 
remove any doubt that the vastness of his wealth had proved the man's ruin, 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> kept his gold-mines for himself, though they were forfeited to the 
State. Executions were now a stimulus to his fury, and he ordered the death 
of all who were lying in prison under accusation of complicity with <name type="person">Sejanus</name>. 
There lay, singly or in heaps, the unnumbered dead, of every age and sex, 
the illustrious with the obscure. Kinsfolk and friends were not allowed to 
be near them, to weep over them, or even to gaze on them too long. Spies 
were set round them, who noted the sorrow of each mourner and followed the 
rotting corpses, till they were dragged to the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, where, floating or driven on the bank, no one 
dared to burn or to touch them. The force of terror had utterly extinguished 
the sense of human fellowship, and, with the growth of cruelty, pity was 
thrust aside.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>About this time <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;sar</name>, who became his grandfather's companion on his retirement to <rs type="placename">Capre&aelig;</rs>, married <name type="person">Claudia</name>, daughter of <name type="person">Marcus 
Silanus</name>. He was a man who masked a savage temper under an artful guise of 
self-restraint, and neither his mother's doom nor the banishment of his 
brothers extorted from him a single utterance. Whatever the humour of the 
day with <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, he would assume the like, and his language differed as 
little. Hence the fame of a clever remark from the orator <name type="person">Passienus</name>, that 
"there never was a better slave or a worse master." </p>
<p>I must not pass over 
a prognostication of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> respecting <name type="person">Servius Galba</name>, then consul. Having 
sent for him and sounded him on various topics, he at last addressed him in 
Greek to this effect: "You too, <name type="person">Galba</name>, will some day have a taste of 
empire." He thus hinted at a brief span of power late in life, on the 
strength of his acquaintance with the art of astrologers, leisure for 
acquiring which he had had at <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs>, 
with <name type="person">Thrasyllus</name> for instructor. This man's skill he tested in the following 
manner.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>Whenever he sought counsel on 
such matters, he would make use of the top of the house and of the 
confidence of one freedman, quite illiterate and of great physical strength. 
The man always walked in front of the person whose science <name type="person">Tiberius</name> had 
determined to test, through an unfrequented

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">TIBERIUS AND 
ASTROLOGY</note>
and precipitous path (for the house stood on rocks), and 
then, if any suspicion had arisen of imposture or of trickery, he hurled the 
astrologer, as he returned, into the sea beneath, that no one might live to 
betray the secret. <name type="person">Thrasyllus</name> accordingly was led up the same cliffs, and 
when he had deeply impressed his questioner by cleverly revealing his 
imperial destiny and future career, he was asked whether he had also 
thoroughly ascertained his own horoscope, and the character of that 
particular year and day. After surveying the positions and relative 
distances of the stars, he first paused, then trembled, and the longer he 
gazed, the more was he agitated by amazement and terror, till at last he 
exclaimed that a perilous and well-nigh fatal crisis impended over him. 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> then embraced him and congratulated him on foreseeing his dangers 
and on being quite safe. Taking what he had said as an oracle, he retained 
him in the number of his intimate friends.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>When I hear of these and like occurrences, I suspend my judgment 
on the question whether it is fate and unchangeable necessity or chance 
which governs the revolutions of human affairs. Indeed, among the wisest of 
the ancients and among their disciples you will find conflicting theories, 
many holding the conviction that heaven does not concern itself with the 
beginning or the end of our life, or, in short, with mankind at all; and 
that therefore sorrows are continually the lot of the good, happiness of the 
wicked; while others, on the contrary, believe that, though there is a 
harmony between fate and events, yet it is not dependent on wandering stars, 
but on primary elements, and on a combination of natural causes. Still, they 
leave us the capacity of choosing our life, maintaining that, the choice 
once made, there is a fixed sequence of events. Good and evil, again, are 
not what vulgar opinion accounts them; many who seem to be struggling with 
adversity are happy; many, amid great affluence, are utterly miserable, if 
only the first bear their hard lot with patience, and the latter make a 
foolish use of their prosperity. </p>
<p>Most men, however, cannot part with the 
belief that each person's future is fixed from his very birth, but that some 
things happen differently from what has been foretold

through the 
impostures of those who describe what they do not know, and that this 
destroys the credit of a science, clear testimonies to which have been given 
both by past ages and by our own. In fact, how the son of this same 
<name type="person">Thrasyllus</name> predicted <name type="person">Nero</name>'s reign I shall relate when the time comes, not to 
digress too far from my subject.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>That 
same year the death of <name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name> became known. That he died of 
starvation, there was not a doubt; whether of his own choice or by 
compulsion, was a question. The emperor was asked whether he would allow him 
to be buried, and he blushed not to grant the favour, and actually blamed 
the accident which had proved fatal to the accused before he could be 
convicted in his presence. Just as if in a three years' interval an 
opportunity was wanting for the trial of an old ex-consul and the father of 
a number of ex-consuls. </p>
<p>Next <name type="person">Drusus</name> perished, after having prolonged 
life for eight days on the most wretched of food, even chewing the stuffing 
of his bed. According to some writers, <name type="person">Macro</name> had been instructed that, in 
case of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> attempting an armed revolt, he was to hurry the young prince 
out of the confinement in which he was detained in the <rs type="placename">Palace</rs> and put him at 
the head of the people. Subsequently the emperor, as a rumour was gaining 
ground that he was on the point of a reconciliation with his daughter-in-law 
and his grandson, chose to be merciless rather than to relent.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>He even bitterly reviled him after his death, 
taunting him with nameless abominations and with a spirit bent on his 
family's ruin and hostile to the State. And, what seemed most horrible of 
all, he ordered a daily journal of all that he said and did to be read in 
public. That there had been spies by his side for so many years, to note his 
looks, his sighs, and even his whispered thoughts, and that his grandfather 
could have heard read, and published all, was scarce credible. But letters 
of <name type="person">Attius</name>, a centurion, and <name type="person">Didymus</name>, a freedman, openly exhibited the names 
of slave after slave who had respectively struck or scared <name type="person">Drusus</name> as he was 
quitting his chamber. The centurion had actually added, as something highly 
meritorious, his own language in all its brutality, and some utterances of 
the dying man in which, at first feigning loss of reason, he imprecated in 
seeming mad-
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DEATH OF DRUSUS AND AGRIPPINA </note>
ness 
fearful things on <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and then, when hope of life was gone, denounced 
him with a studied and elaborate curse. "As he had slain a daughter-in-law, 
a brother's son, and son's sons, and filled his whole house with bloodshed, 
so might he pay the full penalty due to the name and race of his ancestors 
as well as to future generations." </p>
<p>The Senate clamorously interrupted, 
with an affectation of horror, but they were penetrated by alarm and 
amazement at seeing that a hitherto cunning prince, who had shrouded his 
wickedness in mystery, had waxed so bold as to remove, so to speak, the 
walls of his house and display his grandson under a centurion's lash, amid 
the buffetings of slaves, craving in vain the last sustenance of 
life.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>Men's grief at all this had not 
died away when news was heard of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>. She had lived on, sustained by 
hope, I suppose, after the destruction of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, and, when she found no 
abatement of horrors, had voluntarily perished, though possibly nourishment 
was refused her and a fiction concocted of a death that might seem 
self-chosen. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, it is certain, vented his wrath in the foulest 
charges. He reproached her with unchastity, with having had <name type="person">Asinius Gallus</name> 
as a paramour and being driven by his death to loathe existence. But 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>, who could not endure equality and loved to domineer, was with her 
masculine aspirations far removed from the frailties of women. The emperor 
further observed that she died on the same day on which <name type="person">Sejanus</name> had paid the 
penalty of his crime two years before, a fact, he said, to be recorded; and 
he made it a boast that she had not been strangled by the halter and flung 
down the <rs type="placename">Gemonian steps</rs>. He received a vote of thanks, and it was decreed 
that on the seventeenth of October, the day on which both perished, through 
all future years, an offering should be consecrated to <name type="person">Jupiter</name>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>Soon afterwards <name type="person">Cocceius Nerva</name>, a man always 
at the emperor's side, a master of law both divine and human, whose position 
was secure and health sound, resolved to die. <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, as soon as he knew 
it, sat by him and asked his reasons, adding intreaties, and finally 
protesting that it would be a burden on his conscience and a blot on his 
reputation, if the most intimate of his friends were to fly from

life without any cause for death. <name type="person">Nerva</name> turned away from his 
expostulations and persisted in his abstinence from all food. Those who knew 
his thoughts said that as he saw more closely into the miseries of the 
State, he chose, in anger and alarm, an honourable death, while he was yet 
safe and unassailed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s ruin, strange to say, dragged 
<name type="person">Plancina</name> with it. Formerly the wife of <name type="person">Cneius Piso</name>, and one who had openly 
exulted at the death of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, she had been saved, when <name type="person">Piso</name> fell, by 
the intreaties of <name type="person">Augusta</name>, and not less by the enmity of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>. When 
hatred and favour had alike passed away, justice asserted itself. Pursued by 
charges universally notorious, she suffered by her own hand a penalty tardy 
rather than undeserved.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>Amid the many 
sorrows which saddened <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, one cause of grief was 
the marriage of <name type="person">Julia</name>, <name type="person">Drusus</name>'s daughter and <name type="person">Nero</name>'s late wife, into the 
humbler family of <name type="person">Rubellius Blandus</name>, whose grandfather many remembered as a 
Roman knight from <rs type="placename">Tibur</rs>. At the end of the year the death of <name type="person">&AElig;lius 
Lamia</name>, who, after being at last released from the farce of governing <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, had become city-prefect, was celebrated with the 
honours of a censor's funeral. He was a man of illustrious descent, and in a 
hale old age; and the fact of the province having been withheld gained him 
additional esteem. Subsequently, on the death of <name type="person">Flaccus Pomponius</name>, 
propr&aelig;tor of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, a letter from the emperor 
was read, in which he complained that all the best men who were fit to 
command armies declined the service, and that he was thus necessarily driven 
to intreaties, by which some of the ex-consuls might be prevailed on to take 
provinces. He forgot that <name type="person">Arruntius</name> had been kept at home now for ten years, 
that he might not go to <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>. </p>
<p>That same year 
<name type="person">Marcus Lepidus</name> also died. I have dwelt at sufficient length on his 
moderation and wisdom in my earlier books, and I need not further enlarge on 
his noble descent. Assuredly the family of the &AElig;milii has been rich in 
good citizens, and even the members of that house whose morals were corrupt, 
still lived with a certain splendour.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>During the consulship of <name type="person">Paulus Fabius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Vitellius</name>, the bird called 
the ph&oelig;nix, after a long succession

of ages, appeared in <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> and furnished the most learned men of that country 
and of <rs type="placename">Greece</rs> with abundant matter for the 
discussion of the marvellous phenomenon. It is my wish to make known all on 
which they agree with several things, questionable enough indeed, but not 
too absurd to be noticed. </p>
<p>That it is a creature sacred to the sun, 
differing from all other birds in its beak and in the tints of its plumage, 
is held unanimously by those who have described its nature. As to the number 
of years it lives, there are various accounts. The general tradition says 
five hundred years. Some maintain that it is seen at intervals of fourteen 
hundred and sixty-one years, and that the former birds flew into the city 
called <rs type="placename">Heliopolis</rs> successively in the reigns of 
<name type="person">Sesostris</name>, <name type="person">Amasis</name>, and <name type="person">Ptolemy</name>, the third king of the Macedonian dynasty, 
with a multitude of companion birds marvelling at the novelty of the 
appearance. But all antiquity is of course obscure. From <name type="person">Ptolemy</name> to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
was a period of less than five hundred years. Consequently some have 
supposed that this was a spurious ph&oelig;nix, not from the regions of <rs type="placename">Arabia</rs>, and with none of the instincts which ancient 
tradition has attributed to the bird. For when the number of years is 
completed and death is near, the ph&oelig;nix, it is said, builds a nest in 
the land of its birth and infuses into it a germ of life from which an 
offspring arises, whose first care, when fledged, is to bury its father. 
This is not rashly done, but taking up a load of myrrh and having tried its 
strength by a long flight, as soon as it is equal to the burden and to the 
journey, it carries its father's body, bears it to the altar of the Sun, and 
leaves it to the flames. All this is full of doubt and legendary 
exaggeration. Still, there is no question that the bird is occasionally seen 
in <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p><rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile being a scene of ceaseless bloodshed, 
<name type="person">Pomponius Labeo</name>, who was, as I have related, governor of <rs type="placename">M&oelig;sia</rs>, severed his veins and let his life ebb from 
him. His wife, <name type="person">Pax&aelig;a</name>, emulated her husband. What made such deaths 
eagerly sought was dread of the executioner, and the fact too that the 
condemned, besides forfeiture of their property, were deprived of burial, 
while those who decided their fate themselves, had their bodies interred, 
and their wills re-

mained valid, a recompense this for their 
despatch. The emperor, however, argued in a letter to the Senate that it had 
been the practice of our ancestors, whenever they broke off an intimacy, to 
forbid the person their house, and so put an end to friendship. "This usage 
he had himself revived in <name type="person">Labeo</name>'s case, but <name type="person">Labeo</name>, being pressed by charges 
of maladministration in his province and other crimes, had screened his 
guilt by bringing odium on another, and had groundlessly alarmed his wife, 
who, though criminal, was still free from danger." </p><p><name type="person">Mamercus Scaurus</name> was 
then for the second time impeached, a man of distinguished rank and ability 
as an advocate, but of infamous life. He fell, not through the friendship of 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name>, but through what was no less powerful to destroy, the enmity of 
<name type="person">Macro</name>, who practised the same arts more secretly. <name type="person">Macro</name>'s information was 
grounded on the subject of a tragedy written by <name type="person">Scaurus</name>, from which he cited 
some verses which might be twisted into allusions to <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. But <name type="person">Servilius</name> 
and <name type="person">Cornelius</name>, his accusers, alleged adultery with <name type="person">Livia</name> and the practice of 
magical rites. <name type="person">Scaurus</name>, as befitted the old house of the &AElig;milii, 
forestalled the fatal sentence at the persuasion of his wife <name type="person">Sextia</name>, who 
urged him to die and shared his death.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>Still the informers were punished whenever an opportunity 
occurred. <name type="person">Servilius</name> and <name type="person">Cornelius</name>, for example, whom the destruction of 
<name type="person">Scaurus</name> had made notorious, were outlawed and transported to some islands 
for having taken money from <name type="person">Varius Ligur</name> for dropping a prosecution. <name type="person">Abudius 
Ruso</name> too, who had been an &aelig;dile, in seeking to imperil <name type="person">Lentulus 
G&aelig;tulicus</name>, under whom he had commanded a legion, by alleging that he 
had fixed on a son of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> for his son-in-law, was himself actually 
condemned and banished from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <name type="person">G&aelig;tulicus</name> at 
this time was in charge of the legions of <rs type="placename">Upper 
Germany</rs>, and had won from them singular affection, as a man of 
unbounded kindliness, moderate in his strictness, and popular even with the 
neighbouring army through his father-in-law, <name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>. Hence rumour 
persistently affirmed that he had ventured to send the emperor a letter, 
reminding him that his alliance with <name type="person">Sejanus</name> had not originated in his own 
choice, but in the advice

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SUICIDES, PROSECUTIONS, 
BANISHMENTS</note>
of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>; that he was himself as liable to be deceived 
as <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and that the same mistake ought not to be held innocent in the 
prince and be a source of ruin to others. His loyalty was still untainted 
and would so remain, if he was not assailed by any plot. A successor he 
should accept as an announcement of his doom. A compact, so to say, ought to 
be sealed between them, by which he should retain his province, and the 
emperor be master of all else. Strange as this story was, it derived 
credibility from the fact that <name type="person">G&aelig;tulicus</name> alone of all connected with 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name> lived in safety and in high favour, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> bearing in mind the 
people's hatred, his own extreme age and how his government rested more on 
prestige than on power.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>In the 
consulship of <name type="person">Caius Cestius</name> and <name type="person">Marcus Servilius</name>, some Parthian nobles came 
to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, without the knowledge of their king 
<name type="person">Artabanus</name>. Dread of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> had made that prince faithful to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> 
and just to his people, but he subsequently changed this behaviour for 
insolence towards us and tyranny to his subjects. He was elated by the wars 
which he had successfully waged against the surrounding nations, while he 
disdained the aged and, as he thought, unwarlike <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, eagerly coveting 
<rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, over which, on the death of <name type="person">Artaxias</name>, he 
placed <name type="person">Arsaces</name>, his eldest son. He further added insult, and sent envoys to 
reclaim the treasures left by <name type="person">Vonones</name> in <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> and 
<rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>. Then too he insisted on the ancient 
boundaries of <rs type="placename">Persia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Macedonia</rs>, and intimated, with a vainglorious threat, 
that he meant to seize on the country possessed by <name type="person">Cyrus</name> and afterwards by 
<name type="person">Alexander</name>. </p>
<p>The chief adviser of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> in sending the secret 
embassy was <name type="person">Sinnaces</name>, a man of distinguished family and corresponding 
wealth. Next in influence was <name type="person">Abdus</name>, an eunuch, a class which, far from 
being despised among barbarians, actually possesses power. These, with some 
other nobles whom they admitted to their counsels, as there was not a single 
Arsacid whom they could put on the throne, most of the family having been 
murdered by <name type="person">Artabanus</name> or being under age, demanded that <name type="person">Phraates</name>, son of 
king <name type="person">Phraates</name>, should be sent from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. "Only a 
name," they said, "and an authority were wanted; only, in fact, that

with <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s consent, a scion of the house of <name type="person">Arsaces</name> should 
show himself on the banks of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>This suited the wishes of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. He 
provided <name type="person">Phraates</name> with what he needed for assuming his father's sovereignty, 
while he clung to his purpose of regulating foreign affairs by a crafty 
policy and keeping war at a distance. <name type="person">Artabanus</name> meanwhile, hearing of the 
treacherous arrangement, was one moment perplexed by apprehension, the next 
fired with a longing for revenge. With barbarians, indecision is a slave's 
weakness; prompt action king-like. But now expediency prevailed, and he 
invited <name type="person">Abdus</name>, under the guise of friendship, to a banquet, and disabled him 
by a lingering poison; <name type="person">Sinnaces</name> he put off by pretexts and presents, and 
also by various employments. <name type="person">Phraates</name> meanwhile, on arriving in <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, where he threw off the Roman fashions to which 
for so many years he had been accustomed, and adapted himself to Parthian 
habits, unable to endure the customs of his country, was carried off by an 
illness. Still, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> did not relinquish his purpose. He chose <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, 
of the same stock as <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, to be his rival, and the Iberian <name type="person">Mithridates</name> 
to be the instrument of recovering <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, having 
reconciled him to his brother <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, who held the throne of that 
country. He then intrusted the whole of his eastern policy to <name type="person">Lucius 
Vitellius</name>. The man, I am aware, had a bad name at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and many a foul story was told of him. But in the 
government of provinces he acted with the virtue of ancient times. He 
returned, and then, through fear of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> and intimacy with 
<name type="person">Claudius</name>, he degenerated into a servility so base that he is regarded by an 
after-generation as the type of the most degrading adulation. The beginning 
of his career was forgotten in its end, and an old age of infamy effaced the 
virtues of youth.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>Of the petty chiefs 
<name type="person">Mithridates</name> was the first to persuade <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> to aid his enterprise by 
stratagem and force, and agents of corruption were found who tempted the 
servants of <name type="person">Arsaces</name> into crime by a quantity of gold. At the same instant 
the <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> burst into <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> with a huge host, 
and captured the city of <rs type="placename">Artaxata</rs>. <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, on 
hearing this, made his son <name type="person">Orodes</name> the instrument of vengeance. He gave him 
the Parthian army and despatched men to hire

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PARTHIAN 
AFFAIRS</note>
auxiliaries. <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, on the other hand, allied himself 
with the <name type="ethnic">Albanians</name>, and procured aid from the <name type="ethnic">Sarmat&aelig;</name>, whose highest 
chiefs took bribes from both sides, after the fashion of their countrymen, 
and engaged themselves in conflicting interests. But the <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name>, who were 
masters of the various positions, suddenly poured the <name type="ethnic">Sarmat&aelig;</name> into <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> by the <rs type="placename">Caspian</rs> route. 
Meanwhile those who were coming up to the support of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> were 
easily kept back, all other approaches having been closed by the enemy 
except one, between the sea and the mountains on the Albanian frontier, 
which summer rendered difficult, as there the shallows are flooded by the 
force of the Etesian gales. The south wind in winter rolls back the waves, 
and when the sea is driven back upon itself, the shallows along the coast 
are exposed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>Meantime, while <name type="person">Orodes</name> 
was without an ally, <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, now strengthened by reinforcements, 
challenged him to battle, taunted him on his refusal, rode up to his camp 
and harassed his foraging parties. He often hemmed him in with his picquets 
in the fashion of a blockade, till the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, who were unused to such 
insults, gathered round the king and demanded battle. Their sole strength 
was in cavalry; <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> was also powerful in infantry, for the <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> 
and <name type="ethnic">Albanians</name>, inhabiting as they did a densely wooded country, were more 
inured to hardship and endurance. They claim to have been descended from the 
<name type="ethnic">Thessalians</name>, at the period when <name type="person">Jason</name>, after the departure of <name type="person">Medea</name> and the 
children born of her, returned subsequently to the empty palace of 
<name type="person">&AElig;etes</name>, and the vacant kingdom of <name type="ethnic">Colchi</name>. They have many traditions 
connected with his name and with the oracle of <name type="person">Phrixus</name>. No one among them 
would think of sacrificing a ram, the animal supposed to have conveyed 
<name type="person">Phrixus</name>, whether it was really a ram or the figure-head of a ship. </p>
<p>Both 
sides having been drawn up in battle array, the Parthian leader expatiated 
on the empire of the East, and the renown of the Arsacids, in contrast to 
the despicable Iberian chief with his hireling soldiery. <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> 
reminded his people that they had been free from Parthian domination, and 
that the grander their aims, the more glory they would

win if 
victorious, the more disgrace and peril they would incur if they turned 
their backs. He pointed, as he spoke, to his own menacing array, and to the 
Median bands with their golden embroidery; warriors, as he said, on one 
side, spoil on the other.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>Among the 
<name type="ethnic">Sarmat&aelig;</name> the general's voice was not alone to be heard. They encouraged 
one another not to begin the battle with volleys of arrows; they must, they 
said, anticipate attack by a hand to hand charge. Then followed every 
variety of conflict. The <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, accustomed to pursue or fly with equal 
science, deployed their squadrons, and sought scope for their missiles. The 
<name type="ethnic">Sarmat&aelig;</name>, throwing aside their bows, which at a shorter range are 
effective, rushed on with pikes and swords. Sometimes, as in a 
cavalry-action, there would be alternate advances and retreats, then, again, 
close fighting, in which, breast to breast, with the clash of arms, they 
repulsed the foe or were themselves repulsed. And now the <name type="ethnic">Albanians</name> and 
<name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> seized, and hurled the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> from their steeds, and embarrassed 
their enemy with a double attack, pressed as they were by the cavalry on the 
heights and by the nearer blows of the infantry. Meanwhile <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> and 
<name type="person">Orodes</name>, who, as they cheered on the brave and supported the wavering, were 
conspicuous to all, and so recognised each other, rushed to the combat with 
a shout, with javelins, and galloping chargers, <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> with the greater 
impetuosity, for he pierced his enemy's helmet at a stroke. But he could not 
repeat the blow, as he was hurried onwards by his horse, and the wounded man 
was protected by the bravest of his guards. A rumour that he was slain, 
which was believed by mistake, struck panic into the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, and they 
yielded the victory.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p><name type="person">Artabanus</name> very 
soon marched with the whole strength of his kingdom, intent on vengeance. 
The <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> from their knowledge of the country fought at an advantage. 
Still <name type="person">Artabanus</name> did not retreat till <name type="person">Vitellius</name> had assembled his legions 
and, by starting a report that he meant to invade <rs type="placename">Mesopotamia</rs>, raised an alarm of war with <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> was then 
abandoned, and the fortunes of <name type="person">Artabanus</name> were overthrown, <name type="person">Vitellius</name> 
persuading his subjects to forsake a king who was a tyrant in peace, and 
ruinously unsuccessful in war. And so

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DEFEAT OF 
PARTHIANS</note>
<name type="person">Sinnaces</name>, whose enmity to the prince I have already 
mentioned, drew into actual revolt his father <name type="person">Abdageses</name> and others, who had 
been secretly in his counsel, and were now after their continued disasters 
more eager to fight. By degrees, many flocked to him who, having been kept 
in subjection by fear rather than by goodwill, took courage as soon as they 
found leaders. </p>
<p><name type="person">Artabanus</name> had now no resources but in some foreigners who 
guarded his person, men exiled from their own homes, who had no perception 
of honour, or any scruple about a base act, mere hireling instruments of 
crime. With these attendants he hastened his flight into the remote country 
on the borders of <rs type="placename">Scythia</rs>, in the hope of aid, as he 
was connected by marriage alliances with the <name type="ethnic">Hyrcanians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Carmanians</name>. 
Meantime the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, he thought, indulgent as they are to an absent 
prince, though restless under his presence, might turn to a better 
mind.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p><name type="person">Vitellius</name>, as soon as <name type="person">Artabanus</name> 
had fled and his people were inclined to have a new king, urged <name type="person">Tiridates</name> to 
seize the advantage thus offered, and then led the main strength of the 
legions and the allies to the banks of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>. While they were sacrificing, the one, after 
Roman custom, offering a swine, a ram and a bull; the other, a horse which 
he had duly prepared as a propitiation to the river-god, they were informed 
by the neighbouring inhabitants that the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, 
without any violent rains, was of itself rising to an immense height, and 
that the white foam was curling into circles like a diadem, an omen of a 
prosperous passage. Some explained it with more subtlety, of a successful 
commencement to the enterprise, which, however, would not be lasting, on the 
ground, that though a confident trust might be placed in prognostics given 
in the earth or in the heavens, the fluctuating character of rivers 
exhibited omens which vanished the same moment. </p>
<p>A bridge of boats having 
been constructed and the army having crossed, the first to enter the camp 
was <name type="person">Ornospades</name>, with several thousand cavalry. Formerly an exile, he had 
rendered conspicuous aid to <name type="person">Tiberius</name> in the completion of the Dalmatic war, 
and had for this been rewarded with Roman citizenship. Subsequently, he had 
again sought the

friendship of his king, by whom he had been 
raised to high honour, and appointed governor of the plains, which, being 
surrounded by the waters of those famous rivers, the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs> and <rs type="placename">Tigris</rs>, have 
received the name of <rs type="placename">Mesopotamia</rs>. Soon afterwards, 
<name type="person">Sinnaces</name> reinforced the army, and <name type="person">Abdageses</name>, the mainstay of the party, came 
with the royal treasure and what belonged to the crown. <name type="person">Vitellius</name> thought it 
enough to have displayed the arms of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and he 
then bade <name type="person">Tiridates</name> remember his grandfather <name type="person">Phraates</name>, and his foster-father 
<name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, and all that was glorious in both of them, while the nobles 
were to show obedience to their king, and respect for us, each maintaining 
his honour and his loyalty. This done, he returned with the legions to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>I have 
related in sequence the events of two summer-campaigns, as a relief to the 
reader's mind from our miseries at home. Though three years had elapsed 
since the destruction of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, neither time, intreaties, nor sated 
gratification, all which have a soothing effect on others, softened 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, or kept him from punishing doubtful or forgotten offences as most 
flagrant and recent crimes. Under this dread, <name type="person">Fulcinius Trio</name>, unwilling to 
face an onslaught of accusers, inserted in his will several terrible 
imputations on <name type="person">Macro</name> and on the emperor's principal freedmen, while he 
taunted the emperor himself with the mental decay of old age, and the 
virtual exile of continuous retirement. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> ordered these insults, 
which <name type="person">Trio</name>'s heirs had suppressed, to be publicly read, thus showing his 
tolerance of free speech in others and despising his own shame, or, 
possibly, because he had long been ignorant of the villanies of <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, and 
now wished any remarks, however reckless, to be published, and so to 
ascertain, through invective, if it must be so, the truth, which flattery 
obscures. About the same time <name type="person">Granius Marcianus</name>, a senator, who was accused 
of treason by <name type="person">Caius Gracchus</name>, laid hands on himself. <name type="person">Tarius Gratianus</name> too, 
an ex-pr&aelig;tor, was condemned under the same law to capital 
punishment.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>A similar fate befell 
<name type="person">Trebellienus Rufus</name> and <name type="person">Sextius Paconianus</name>. <name type="person">Trebellienus</name> perished by his own 
hand; <name type="person">Paconianus</name> was strangled in prison for having there written some 
lampoons on the emperor. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> received the news, no

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROSECUTIONS AND SUICIDES</note>
longer parted by the sea, as 
he had been once, or through messengers from a distance, but in close 
proximity to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, so that on the same day, or after 
the interval of a single night, he could reply to the despatches of the 
consuls, and almost behold the bloodshed as it streamed from house to house, 
and the strokes of the executioner. </p>
<p>At the year's close <name type="person">Popp&aelig;us 
Sabinus</name> died, a man of somewhat humble extraction, who had risen by his 
friendship with two emperors to the consulship and the honours of a triumph. 
During twenty-four years he had the charge of the most important provinces, 
not for any remarkable ability, but because he was equal to business and was 
not too great for it.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p><name type="person">Quintus 
Plautius</name> and <name type="person">Sextus Papinius</name> were the next consuls. The fact that that year 
<name type="person">Lucius Aruseius</name> was put to death did not strike men as anything horrible, 
from their familiarity with evil deeds. But there was a panic when <name type="person">Vibulenus 
Agrippa</name>, a Roman knight, as soon as his accusers had finished their case, 
took from his robe, in the very <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs>, a dose of poison, drank it 
off, and, as he fell expiring, was hurried away to prison by the prompt 
hands of lictors, where the neck of the now lifeless man was crushed with 
the halter. Even <name type="person">Tigranes</name>, who had once ruled <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> and was now impeached, did not escape the 
punishment of an ordinary citizen on the strength of his royal title. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">Caius Galba</name> meanwhile and the Blaesi perished by a voluntary death; 
<name type="person">Galba</name>, because a harsh letter from the emperor forbade him to have a 
province allotted to him; while, as for the Blaesi, the priesthoods intended 
for them during the prosperity of their house, <name type="person">Tiberius</name> had withheld, when 
that prosperity was shaken, and now conferred, as vacant offices, on others. 
This they understood as a signal of their doom, and acted on it. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">&AElig;milia Lepida</name> too, whose marriage with the younger <name type="person">Drusus</name> I have 
already related, who, though she had pursued her husband with ceaseless 
accusations, remained unpunished, infamous as she was, as long as her father 
<name type="person">Lepidus</name> lived, subsequently fell a victim to the informers for adultery with 
a slave. There was no question about her guilt, and so without an attempt at 
defence she put an end to her life.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>At this same time the <name type="ethnic">Clit&aelig;</name>, a tribe subject to the 
<name type="person">Cappadocian Archelaus</name>, retreated to the heights of <rs type="placename">Mount 
Taurus</rs>, because they were compelled in Roman fashion to render an 
account of their revenue and submit to tribute. There they defended 
themselves by means of the nature of the country against the king's 
unwarlike troops, till <name type="person">Marcus Trebellius</name>, whom <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, the governor of 
<rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, sent as his lieutenant with four thousand 
legionaries and some picked auxiliaries, surrounded with his lines two hills 
occupied by the barbarians, the lesser of which was named <name type="person">Cadra</name>, the other 
<name type="person">Davara</name>. Those who dared to sally out, he reduced to surrender by the sword, 
the rest by drought. </p>
<p><name type="person">Tiridates</name> meanwhile, with the consent of the 
<name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, received the submission of <rs type="placename">Nicephorium</rs>, <rs type="placename">Anthemusias</rs> and the other 
cities, which having been founded by <name type="ethnic">Macedonians</name>, claim Greek names, also of 
the Parthian towns <rs type="placename">Halus</rs> and <rs type="placename">Artemita</rs>. There was a rivalry of joy among the 
inhabitants who detested <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, bred as he had been among the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, 
for his cruelty, and hoped to find in <name type="person">Tiridates</name> a kindly spirit from his 
Roman training.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p><rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs>, a powerful and fortified city which had never 
lapsed into barbarism, but had clung loyally to its founder <name type="person">Seleucus</name>, 
assumed the most marked tone of flattery. Three hundred citizens, chosen for 
wealth or wisdom, form a kind of senate, and the people have powers of their 
own. When both act in concert, they look with contempt on the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>; as 
soon as they are at discord, and the respective leaders invite aid for 
themselves against their rivals, the ally summoned to help a faction crushes 
them all. This had lately happened in the reign of <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, who, for his 
own interest, put the people at the mercy of the nobles. As a fact, popular 
government almost amounts to freedom, while the rule of the few approaches 
closely to a monarch's caprice. </p>
<p><rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs> now 
celebrated the arrival of <name type="person">Tiridates</name> with all the honours paid to princes of 
old and all which modern times, with a more copious inventiveness, have 
devised. Reproaches were at the same time heaped on <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, as an Arsacid 
indeed on his mother's side, but as in all else degenerate. <name type="person">Tiridates</name> gave 
the government of <rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs> to the people. Soon 
afterwards, as he was deliberating on what day

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROGRESS AND 
DECLINE OF TIRIDATES</note>
he should inaugurate his reign, he received 
letters from <name type="person">Phraates</name> and <name type="person">Hiero</name>, who held two very powerful provinces, 
imploring a brief delay. It was thought best to wait for men of such 
commanding influence, and meanwhile <rs type="placename">Ctesiphon</rs>, the seat of empire, was their 
chosen destination. But as they postponed their coming from day to day, the 
Surena, in the presence of an approving throng, crowned <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, according 
to the national usage, with the royal diadem.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>And now had he instantly made his way to the heart of the 
country and to its other tribes, the reluctance of those who wavered, would 
have been overpowered, and all to a man would have yielded. By besieging a 
fortress into which <name type="person">Artabanus</name> had conveyed his treasure and his concubines, 
he gave them time to disown their compact. <name type="person">Phraates</name> and <name type="person">Hiero</name>, with others 
who had not united in celebrating the day fixed for the coronation, some 
from fear, some out of jealousy of <name type="person">Abdageses</name>, who then ruled the court and 
the new king, transferred their allegiance to <name type="person">Artabanus</name>. They found him in 
<rs type="placename">Hyrcania</rs>, covered with filth and procuring sustenance with his bow. He was 
at first alarmed under the impression that treachery was intended, but when 
they pledged their honour that they had come to restore to him his dominion, 
his spirit revived, and he asked what the sudden change meant. <name type="person">Hiero</name> then 
spoke insultingly of the boyish years of <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, hinting that the throne 
was not held by an Arsacid, but that a mere empty name was enjoyed by a 
feeble creature bred in foreign effeminacy, while the actual power was in 
the house of Abdageses.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>An 
experienced king, <name type="person">Artabanus</name> knew that men do not necessarily feign hatred 
because they are false in friendship. He delayed only while he was raising 
auxiliaries in <rs type="placename">Scythia</rs>, and then pushed on in haste, 
thus anticipating the plots of enemies and the fickleness of friends. 
Wishing to attract popular sympathy, he did not even cast off his miserable 
garb. He stooped to wiles and to entreaties, to anything indeed by which he 
might allure the wavering and confirm the willing. </p>
<p>He was now 
approaching the neighbourhood of <rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs> with a 
large force, while <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, dismayed by the rumour and then by the king's 
presence in person, was divided in mind, and doubted whether he should march 
against him or 

prolong the war by delay. Those who wished for 
battle with its prompt decision argued that ill-arrayed levies fatigued by a 
long march could not even in heart be thoroughly united in obedience, 
traitors and enemies, as they had lately been, to the prince whom now again 
they were supporting <name type="person">Abdageses</name>, however, advised a retreat into <rs type="placename">Mesopotamia</rs>. There, with a river in their front, they 
might in the interval summon to their aid the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Elym&aelig;ans</name> 
and other nations in their rear, and then, reinforced by allies and troops 
which would be sent by the Roman general, they might try the fortune of war. 
This advice prevailed, for <name type="person">Abdageses</name> had the chief influence and <name type="person">Tiridates</name> 
was a coward in the face of danger. But their retreat resembled a flight. 
The <name type="ethnic">Arabs</name> made a beginning, and then the rest went to their homes or to the 
camp of <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, till <name type="person">Tiridates</name> returned to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> 
with a few followers and thus relieved all from the disgrace of 
desertion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>That same year <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> suffered from a terrible fire, and part of the 
circus near the <rs type="placename">Aventine</rs> hill was burnt, as well as 
the <rs type="placename">Aventine</rs> quarter itself. This calamity the 
emperor turned to his own glory by paying the values of the houses and 
blocks of tenements. A hundred million of sesterces was expended in this 
munificence, a boon all the more acceptable to the populace, as <name type="person">Tiberius</name> was 
rather sparing in building at his private expense. He raised only two 
structures even at the public cost, the <rs type="placename">temple of Augustus</rs> and the stage of 
<rs type="placename">Pompey's theatre</rs>, and when these were completed, he did not dedicate them, 
either out of contempt for popularity or from his extreme age. Four 
commissioners, all husbands of the emperor's granddaughters&mdash;<name type="person">Cneius 
Domitius</name>, <name type="person">Cassius Longinus</name>, <name type="person">Marcus Vinicius</name>, <name type="person">Rubellius Blandus</name>&mdash;were 
appointed to assess the damage in each case, and <name type="person">Publius Petronius</name> was added 
to their number on the nomination of the consuls. Various honours were 
devised and decreed to the emperor such as each man's ingenuity suggested. 
It is a question which of these he rejected or accepted, as the end of his 
life was so near. </p>
<p>For soon afterwards <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s last consuls, <name type="person">Cneius 
Acerronius</name> and <name type="person">Caius Pontius</name>, entered on office, <name type="person">Macro</name>'s power being now 
excessive. Every day the man cultivated more as-
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FIRE AT 
<rs type="placename">ROME</rs>; SUCCESSION CONSIDERED</note> 
siduously than 
ever the favour of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, which, indeed, he had never neglected, 
and after the death of <name type="person">Claudia</name>, who had, as I have related, been married to 
<name type="person">Caius</name>, he had prompted his wife <name type="person">Ennia</name> to inveigle the young prince by a 
pretence of love, and to bind him by an engagement of marriage, and the lad, 
provided he could secure the throne, shrank from no conditions. For though 
he was of an excitable temper, he had thoroughly learnt the falsehoods of 
hypocrisy under the loving care of his grandfather.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>This the emperor knew, and he therefore hesitated 
about bequeathing the empire, first, between his grandsons. Of these, the 
son of <name type="person">Drusus</name> was nearest in blood and natural affection, but he was still 
in his childhood. <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s son was in the vigour of youth and enjoyed 
the people's favour, a reason for having his grandfather's hatred. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
had even thought of <name type="person">Claudius</name>, as he was of sedate age and had a taste for 
liberal culture, but a weak intellect was against him. If however he were to 
seek a successor outside of his house, he feared that the memory of <name type="person">Augustus</name> 
and the name of the C&aelig;sars would become a laughing-stock and a scorn. 
It was, in fact, not so much popularity in the present for which he cared as 
for glory in the future. </p>
<p>Perplexed in mind, exhausted in body, he soon 
left to destiny a question to which he was unequal, though he threw out some 
hints from which it might be inferred that he foresaw what was to come. He 
taunted <name type="person">Macro</name>, in no obscure terms, with forsaking the setting and looking 
to the rising sun. Once too when <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> in a casual conversation 
ridiculed <name type="person">Lucius Sulla</name>, he predicted to him that he would have all <name type="person">Sulla</name>'s 
vices and none of his virtues. At the same moment he embraced the younger of 
his two grandsons with a flood of tears, and, noting the savage face of the 
other said, "You will slay this boy, and will be yourself slain by another." 
But even while his strength was fast failing he gave up none of his 
debaucheries. In his sufferings he would simulate health, and was wont to 
jest at the arts of the physician and at all who, after the age of thirty, 
require another man's advice to distinguish between what is beneficial or 
hurtful to their constitutions.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile were being sown the seeds of

bloodshed to come even after <name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s death. <name type="person">Acutia</name>, formerly the 
wife of <name type="person">Publius Vitellius</name>, had been accused of treason by <name type="person">L&aelig;lius 
Balbus</name>. When on her condemnation a reward was being voted to her prosecutor, 
<name type="person">Junius Otho</name>, tribune of the people, interposed his veto. Hence a feud 
between <name type="person">Vitellius</name> and <name type="person">Otho</name>, ending in <name type="person">Otho</name>'s banishment. Then <name type="person">Albucilla</name>, 
notorious for the number of her lovers, who had been married to <name type="person">Satrius 
Secundus</name>, the betrayer of the late conspiracy, was charged with irreverence 
towards the emperor. With her were involved as her accomplices and paramours 
<name type="person">Cneius Domitius</name>, <name type="person">Vibius Marsus</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Arruntius</name>. I have already spoken 
of the illustrious rank of <name type="person">Domitius</name>. <name type="person">Marsus</name> too was distinguished by the 
honours of his ancestors and by his own attainments. It was, however, stated 
in the notes of the proceedings furnished to the Senate that <name type="person">Macro</name> had 
superintended the examination of the witnesses and the torture of the 
slaves, and the fact that there was no letter from the emperor against the 
defendants caused a suspicion that, while he was very feeble and possibly 
ignorant of the matter, the charge was to a great extent invented to gratify 
<name type="person">Macro</name>'s well-known enmity against <name type="person">Arruntius</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>And so <name type="person">Domitius</name> and <name type="person">Marsus</name> prolonged their lives, <name type="person">Domitius</name>, 
preparing his defence, <name type="person">Marsus</name>, having apparently resolved on starvation. 
<name type="person">Arruntius</name>, when his friends advised delay and temporising, replied that "the 
same conduct was not becoming in all persons. He had had enough of life, and 
all he regretted was that he had endured amid scorn and peril an old age of 
anxious fears, long detested by <name type="person">Sejanus</name>, now by <name type="person">Macro</name>, always, indeed, by 
some powerful minister, not for any fault, but as a man who could not 
tolerate gross iniquities. Granted the possibility of passing safely through 
the few last days of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>. How was he to be secure under the youth of 
the coming sovereign? Was it probable that, when <name type="person">Tiberius</name> with his long 
experience of affairs was, under the influence of absolute power, wholly 
perverted and changed, <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, who had hardly completed his 
boyhood, was thoroughly ignorant and bred under the vilest training, would 
enter on a better course, with <name type="person">Macro</name> for his guide, who having been selected 
for his superior wickedness, to crush <name type="person">Sejanus</name> had by yet more numerous 
crimes been the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FURTHER PROSECUTIONS FOR

scourge of the State? He now foresaw a still more galling 
slavery, and therefore sought to flee alike from the past and from the 
impending future." </p>
<p>While he thus spoke like a prophet, he opened his 
veins. What followed will be a proof that <name type="person">Arruntius</name> rightly chose death. 
<name type="person">Albucilla</name>, having stabbed herself with an ineffectual wound, was by the 
Senate's order carried off to prison. Those who had ministered to her 
profligacy, <name type="person">Carsidius Sacerdos</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, and <name type="person">Pontius Fregellanus</name> 
were sentenced, respectively, to transportation to an island and to loss of 
a senator's rank. A like punishment was adjudged in the case of <name type="person">L&aelig;lius 
Balbus</name>, and, indeed, with intense satisfaction, as <name type="person">Balbus</name> was noted for his 
savage eloquence and his eagerness to assail the innocent.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>About the same time <name type="person">Sextus Papinius</name>, who belonged 
to a family of consular rank, chose a sudden and shocking death, by throwing 
himself from a height. The cause was ascribed to his mother, who, having 
been repeatedly repulsed in her overtures, had at last by her arts and 
seductions driven him to an extremity from which he could find no escape but 
death. She was accordingly put on her trial before the Senate, and, although 
she grovelled at the knees of the senators and long urged a parent's grief, 
the greater weakness of a woman's mind under such an affliction and other 
sad and pitiful pleas of the same painful kind, she was after all banished 
from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> for ten years, till her younger son would 
have passed the frail period of youth.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p><name type="person">Tiberius</name>'s bodily powers were now leaving him, but not his skill 
in dissembling. There was the same stern spirit; he had his words and looks 
under strict control, and occasionally would try to hide his weakness, 
evident as it was, by a forced politeness. After frequent changes of place, 
he at last settled down on the promontory of <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs> 
in a country-house once owned by <name type="person">Lucius Lucullus</name>. It was there discovered 
that he was drawing near his end, and thus. There was a physician, 
distinguished in his profession, of the name of <name type="person">Charicles</name>, usually employed, 
not indeed to have the direction of the emperor's varying health, but to put 
his advice at immediate disposal. This man, as if he were leaving on 
business of his own, clasped his hand, with a show of homage,

and 
touched his pulse. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> noticed it. Whether he was displeased and strove 
the more to hide his anger, is a question; at any rate, he ordered the 
banquet to be renewed, and sat at the table longer than usual, by way, 
apparently, of showing honour to his departing friend. <name type="person">Charicles</name>, however, 
assured <name type="person">Macro</name> that his breath was failing and that he would not last more 
than two days. All was at once hurry; there were conferences among those on 
the spot and despatches to the generals and armies. On the 15th of March, 
his breath failing, he was believed to have expired, and <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> 
was going forth with a numerous throng of congratulating followers to take 
the first possession of the empire, when suddenly news came that <name type="person">Tiberius</name> 
was recovering his voice and sight, and calling for persons to bring him 
food to revive him from his faintness. Then ensued a universal panic, and 
while the rest fled hither and thither, every one feigning grief or 
ignorance, <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, in silent stupor, passed from the highest 
hopes to the extremity of apprehension. <name type="person">Macro</name>, nothing daunted, ordered the 
old emperor to be smothered under a huge heap of clothes, and all to quit 
the entrance-hall.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>And so died 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name>, in the seventy-eighth year of his age. <name type="person">Nero</name> was his father, and he 
was on both sides descended from the Claudian house, though his mother 
passed by adoption, first into the Livian, then into the <placeName key="tgn,2118773">Julian</placeName> family. From 
earliest infancy, perilous vicissitudes were his lot. Himself an exile, he 
was the companion of a proscribed father, and on being admitted as a stepson 
into the house of <name type="person">Augustus</name>, he had to struggle with many rivals, so long as 
<name type="person">Marcellus</name> and <name type="person">Agrippa</name> and, subsequently, <name type="person">Caius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius C&aelig;sar</name> were 
in their glory. Again his brother <name type="person">Drusus</name> enjoyed in a greater degree the 
affection of the citizens. But he was more than ever on dangerous ground 
after his marriage with <name type="person">Julia</name>, whether he tolerated or escaped from his 
wife's profligacy. On his return from <rs type="placename">Rhodes</rs> he ruled the emperor's now heirless house for twelve years, and the Roman 
world, with absolute sway, for about twenty-three. His character too had its 
distinct periods. It was a bright time in his life and reputation, while 
under <name type="person">Augustus</name> he was a private citizen or held high offices; a time of 
reserve and crafty assumption of vir-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DEATH OF 
TIBERIUS</note>
tue, as long as <name type="person">Germanicus</name> and <name type="person">Drusus</name> were alive. Again 
while his mother lived, he was a compound of good and evil; he was infamous 
for his cruelty, though he veiled his debaucheries, while he loved or feared 
<name type="person">Sejanus</name>. Finally, he plunged into every wickedness and disgrace, when fear 
and shame being cast off, he simply indulged his own inclinations.
<note type="ed" anchored="yes"><p>[The four following books and the beginning of Book XI, which are 
lost, contained the history of a period of nearly ten years, from A.D. 37 to 
A.D. 47. These years included the reign of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> (<name type="person">Caligula</name>), the 
son of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> by the elder <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and the first six years of the 
reign of <name type="person">Claudius</name>. <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>'s reign was three years ten months and 
eight days in duration. <name type="person">Claudius</name> (<name type="person">Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus</name>), 
the brother of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, succeeded him, at the age of fifty, and reigned 
from A.D. 41 to A.D. 54. </p>
<p>The Eleventh Book of the Annals opens with the 
seventh year of <name type="person">Claudius</name>'s reign. The power of his wife <name type="person">Messalina</name> was then 
at its height. She was, it seems, jealous of a certain <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a Sabina</name>, 
who is mentioned in Book XIII., &sect; 45, as "having surpassed in beauty 
all the ladies of her day." This <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> was the daughter of the 
<name type="person">Popp&aelig;us Sabinus</name> alluded to in Book VI., &sect; 39, and the mother of

<name type="person">Messalina</name> contrived to involve this lady and her lover, <name type="person">Valerius Asiaticus</name>,

C&aelig;sar</name>, a second time under <name type="person">Claudius</name> in A.D. 46. He was rich as well as 
noble. The Eleventh Book, as we have it, begins with the account of his 
prosecution by means of <name type="person">Messalina</name>, who with the help of <name type="person">Lucius Vitellius</name>, 
the father of the <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, afterwards emperor, effected his

<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p><name type="person">MESSALINA</name> believed that <name type="person">Valerius Asiaticus</name>, who had been twice consul, was 
one of <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>'s old lovers. At the same time she was looking greedily 
at the gardens which <name type="person">Lucullus</name> had begun and which <name type="person">Asiaticus</name> was now adorning 
with singular magnificence, and so she suborned <name type="person">Suilius</name> to accuse both him 
and <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>. With <name type="person">Suilius</name> was associated <name type="person">Sosibius</name>, tutor to 
<name type="person">Britannicus</name>, who was to give <name type="person">Claudius</name> an apparently friendly warning to 
beware of a power and wealth which threatened the throne. <name type="person">Asiaticus</name>, he 
said, had been the ringleader in the murder of a <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, and then had 
not feared to face an assembly of the Roman people, to own the deed, and 
challenge its glory for his own. Thus grown famous in the capital, and with 
a renown widely spread through the provinces, he was planning a journey to 
the armies of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>. Born at <rs type="placename">Vienna</rs>, and supported by numerous and powerful 
connections, he would find it easy to rouse nations allied to his house. 
<name type="person">Claudius</name> made no further inquiry, but sent <name type="person">Crispinus</name>, commander of the 
Pr&aelig;torians, with troops in hot haste, as though to put down a revolt. 
<name type="person">Crispinus</name> found him at <rs type="placename">Bai&aelig;</rs>, loaded him with chains, and hurried him 
to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>No 
hearing before the Senate was granted him. It was in the emperor's chamber, 
in the presence of <name type="person">Messalina</name>, that he was heard. There <name type="person">Suilius</name> accused him 
of corrupting the troops, of binding them by bribes and indulgences to share 
in every crime, of adultery with <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>, and finally of unmanly vice. 
It was at this last that the accused broke silence, and burst out with the 
words, "Question thy own sons, <name type="person">Suilius</name>; they will own my manhood." Then he 
entered on his defence. <name type="person">Claudius</name> he moved profoundly, and he even drew tears 
from <name type="person">Messalina</name>. But as she left the chamber to

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MESSALINA'S 
PROSECUTIONS</note>
wipe them away, she warned <name type="person">Vitellius</name> not to let the man 
escape. She hastened herself to effect <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>'s destruction, and hired 
agents to drive her to suicide by the terrors of a prison. <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> 
meanwhile was so unconscious that a few days afterwards he asked her husband 
<name type="person">Scipio</name>, who was dining with him, why he sat down to table without his wife, 
and was told in reply that she had paid the debt of nature.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>When <name type="person">Claudius</name> began to deliberate about the acquittal 
of <name type="person">Asiaticus</name>, <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, with tears in his eyes, spoke of his old friendship 
with the accused, and of their joint homage to the emperor's mother, 
<name type="person">Antonia</name>. He then briefly reviewed the services of <name type="person">Asiaticus</name> to the State, 
his recent campaign in the invasion of <rs type="placename">Britain</rs>, and 
everything else which seemed likely to win compassion, and suggested that he 
should be free to choose his death. <name type="person">Claudius</name>'s reply was in the same tone of 
mercy. Some friends urged on <name type="person">Asiaticus</name> the quiet death of self-starvation, 
but he declined it with thanks. He took his usual exercise, then bathed and 
dined cheerfully, and saying that he had better have fallen by the craft of 
<name type="person">Tiberius</name> or the fury of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> than by the treachery of a woman 
and the shameless mouth of <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, he opened his veins, but not till he 
had inspected his funeral pyre, and directed its removal to another spot, 
lest the smoke should hurt the thick foliage of the trees. So complete was 
his calmness even to the last.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>The 
senators were then convoked, and <name type="person">Suilius</name> proceeded to find new victims in 
two knights of the first rank who bore the surname of <name type="person">Petra</name>. The real cause 
of their destruction was that they had lent their house for the meetings of 
<name type="person">Mnester</name> and <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>. But it was a vision of the night that was the 
actual charge against one of them. He had, it was alleged, beheld <name type="person">Claudius</name> 
crowned with a garland of wheat, the ears of which were turned downwards, 
and, from this appearance, he foretold scanty harvests. Some have said that 
it was a vine-wreath, of which the leaves were white, which he saw, and that 
he interpreted it to signify the death of the emperor after the turn of 
autumn. It is, however, beyond dispute that in consequence of some dream, 
whatever it was, both the man and his brother perished. </p>
<p>Fifteen hundred 
thousand sesterces and the decorations of

the pr&aelig;torship 
were voted to <name type="person">Crispinus</name>. <name type="person">Vitellius</name> bestowed a million on <name type="person">Sosibius</name>, for 
giving <name type="person">Britannicus</name> the benefit of his teaching and <name type="person">Claudius</name> that of his 
counsels. I may add that when <name type="person">Scipio</name> was called on for his opinion, he 
replied, "As I think what all men think about the deeds of <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>, 
suppose me to say what all men say." A graceful compromise this between the 
affection of the husband and the necessities of the senator.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p><name type="person">Suilius</name> after this plied his accusations without 
cessation or pity, and his audacity had many rivals. By assuming to himself 
all the functions of laws and magistrates, the emperor had left exposed 
everything which invited plunder, and of all articles of public merchandise 
nothing was more venal than the treachery of advocates. Thus it happened 
that one <name type="person">Samius</name>, a Roman knight of the first rank, who had paid four hundred 
thousand sesterces to <name type="person">Suilius</name>, stabbed himself in the advocate's house, on 
ascertaining his collusion with the adversary. Upon this, following the lead 
of <name type="person">Silius</name>, consul-elect, whose elevation and fall I shall in due course 
relate, the senators rose in a body, and demanded the enforcement of the 
Cincian law, an old enactment, which forbade any one to receive a fee or a 
gift for pleading a cause.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>When the 
men, at whom this strong censure was levelled, loudly protested, <name type="person">Silius</name>, who 
had a quarrel with <name type="person">Suilius</name>, attacked them with savage energy. He cited as 
examples the orators of old who had thought fame with posterity the fairest 
recompense of eloquence. And, "apart from this," he said, "the first of 
noble accomplishments was debased by sordid services, and even good faith 
could not be upheld in its integrity, when men looked at the greatness of 
their gains. If law suits turned to no one's profit, there would be fewer of 
them. As it was, quarrels, accusations, hatreds and wrongs were encouraged, 
in order that, as the violence of disease brings fees to the physician, so 
the corruption of the forum might enrich the advocate. They should remember 
<name type="person">Caius Asinius</name> and <name type="person">Messala</name>, and, in later days, <name type="person">Arruntius</name> and 
<name type="person">&AElig;serninus</name>, men raised by a blameless life and by eloquence to the 
highest honours." </p>
<p>So spoke the consul-elect, and others agreed with him. 
A resolution was being framed to bring the guilty under the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SHOULD ADVOCATES RECEIVE FEES?</note>
law of extortion, when 
<name type="person">Suilius</name> and <name type="person">Cossutianus</name> and the rest who saw themselves threatened with 
punishment rather than trial, for their guilt was manifest, gathered round 
the emperor, and prayed forgiveness for the past.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>When he had nodded assent, they began to plead their cause. "Who," 
they asked, "can be so arrogant as to anticipate in hope an eternity of 
renown? It is for the needs and the business of life that the resource of 
eloquence is acquired, thanks to which no one for want of an advocate is at 
the mercy of the powerful. But eloquence cannot be obtained for nothing; 
private affairs are neglected, in order that a man may devote himself to the 
business of others. Some support life by the profession of arms, some by 
cultivating land. No work is expected from any one of which he has not 
before calculated the profits. It was easy for <name type="person">Asinius</name> and <name type="person">Messala</name>, enriched 
with the prizes of the conflict between <name type="person">Antony</name> and <name type="person">Augustus</name>, it was easy for 
<name type="person">Arruntius</name> and <name type="person">&AElig;serninus</name>, the heirs of wealthy families, to assume 
grand airs. We have examples at hand. How great were the fees for which 
<name type="person">Publius Clodius</name> and <name type="person">Caius Curio</name> were wont to speak! We are ordinary 
senators, seeking in the tranquillity of the State for none but peaceful 
gains. You must consider the plebeian, how he gains distinction from the 
gown. Take away the rewards of a profession, and the profession must 
perish." The emperor thought that these arguments, though less noble, were 
not without force. He limited the fee which might be taken to ten thousand 
sesterces, and those who exceeded this limit were to be liable to the 
penalties of extortion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>About this same 
time <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, of whom I have before spoken as having ruled <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, and having been imprisoned by order of <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;sar</name>, made his way back to his kingdom at the suggestion of <name type="person">Claudius</name> 
and in reliance on the help of <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>. This <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, who was king 
of the <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> and <name type="person">Mithridates</name>' brother, now told him that the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> 
were divided, and that the highest questions of empire being uncertain, 
lesser matters were neglected. <name type="person">Gotarzes</name>, among his many cruelties, had 
caused the death of his brother <name type="person">Artabanus</name>, with his wife and son. Hence his 
people feared for themselves and sent for <name type="person">Vardanes</name>. Ever ready for daring 
achievements, <name type="person">Vardanes</name> traversed 375 miles

in two days, and drove 
before him the surprised and terrified <name type="person">Gotarzes</name>. Without a moment's delay, 
he seized the neighbouring governments, <rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs> 
alone refusing his rule. Rage against the place, which indeed had also 
revolted from his father, rather than considerations of policy, made him 
embarrass himself with the siege of a strong city, which the defence of a 
river flowing by it, with fortifications and supplies, had thoroughly 
secured. <name type="person">Gotarzes</name> meanwhile, aided by the resources of the <name type="ethnic">Dah&aelig;</name> and 
<name type="ethnic">Hyrcanians</name>, renewed the war; and <name type="person">Vardanes</name>, compelled to raise the siege of 
<rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs>, encamped on the plains of <rs type="placename">Bactria</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Then it 
was that while the forces of the East were divided, and hesitated which side 
they should take, the opportunity of occupying <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> was presented to <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, who had the 
vigorous soldiers of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> to storm the fortified 
heights, while his Iberian cavalry scoured the plain. The <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> made no 
resistance after their governor, <name type="person">Demonax</name>, had ventured on a battle and had 
been routed. <name type="person">Cotys</name>, king of <rs type="placename">Lesser Armenia</rs>, to whom 
some of the nobles inclined, caused some delay, but he was stopped by a 
despatch from <name type="person">Claudius</name>, and then everything passed into the hands of 
<name type="person">Mithridates</name>, who showed more cruelty than was wise in a new ruler. The 
Parthian princes however, just when they were beginning battle, came to a 
sudden agreement, on discovering a plot among their people, which <name type="person">Gotarzes</name> 
revealed to his brother. At first they approached each other with 
hesitation; then, joining right hands, they promised before the altars of 
their gods to punish the treachery of their enemies and to yield one to the 
other. <name type="person">Vardanes</name> seemed more capable of retaining rule. <name type="person">Gotarzes</name>, to avoid 
all rivalry, retired into the depths of <rs type="placename">Hyrcania</rs>. 
When <name type="person">Vardanes</name> returned, <rs type="placename">Seleucia</rs> capitulated to him, 
seven years after its revolt, little to the credit of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, whom a 
single city had so long defied.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>He 
then visited the strongest governments, and was eager to recover <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, but was stopped by <name type="person">Vibius Marsus</name>, governor of 
<rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, who threatened war. Meanwhile <name type="person">Gotarzes</name>, who 
repented of having relinquished his throne, at the solicitation of the 
nobility, to whom subjection is a special hardship in peace, collected a 
force. <name type="person">Vardanes</name>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">COMMOTIONS IN <rs type="placename">PARTHIA</rs></note>
marched against him to the river <rs type="placename">Charinda</rs>; a fierce battle was fought over the passage, 
<name type="person">Vardanes</name> winning a complete victory, and in a series of successful 
engagements subduing the intermediate tribes as far as the river <rs type="placename">Sindes</rs>, which is the boundary between the <name type="ethnic">Dah&aelig;</name> and 
the <name type="ethnic">Arians</name>. There his successes terminated. The <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, victorious though 
they were, rebelled against distant service. So after erecting monuments on 
which he recorded his greatness, and the tribute won from peoples from whom 
no Arsacid had won it before, he returned covered with glory, and therefore 
the more haughty and more intolerable to his subjects than ever. They 
arranged a plot, and slew him when he was off his guard and intent upon the 
chase. He was still in his first youth, and might have been one of the 
illustrious few among aged princes, had he sought to be loved by his 
subjects as much as to be feared by his foes. </p>
<p>The murder of <name type="person">Vardanes</name> 
threw the affairs of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> into confusion, as the 
people were in doubt who should be summoned to the throne. Many inclined to 
<name type="person">Gotarzes</name>, some to <name type="person">Meherdates</name>, a descendant of <name type="person">Phraates</name>, who was a hostage in 
our hands. Finally <name type="person">Gotarzes</name> prevailed. Established in the palace, he drove 
the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> by his cruelty and profligacy to send a secret entreaty to the 
Roman emperor that <name type="person">Meherdates</name> might be allowed to mount the throne of his 
ancestors.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>It was during this 
consulship, in the eight hundredth year after the foundation of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and the sixty-fourth after their celebration by 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> that the secular games were exhibited. I say nothing of the 
calculations of the two princes, which I have sufficiently discussed in my 
history of the emperor <name type="person">Domitian</name>; for he also exhibited secular games, at 
which indeed, being one of the priesthood of the Fifteen and pr&aelig;tor at 
the time, I specially assisted. It is in no boastful spirit that I mention 
this, but because this duty has immemorially belonged to the College of the 
Fifteen, and the pr&aelig;tors have performed the chief functions in these 
ceremonies. While <name type="person">Claudius</name> sat to witness the games of the circus, some of 
the young nobility acted on horseback the battle of <rs type="placename">Troy</rs>. Among them was <name type="person">Britannicus</name>, the emperor's son, and 
<name type="person">Lucius Domitius</name>, who became soon afterwards by adoption heir to the empire 
with the surname of <name type="person">Nero</name>. The

stronger popular enthusiasm which 
greeted him was taken to presage his greatness. It was commonly reported 
that snakes had been seen by his cradle, which they seemed to guard, a 
fabulous tale invented to match the marvels of other lands. <name type="person">Nero</name>, never a 
disparager of himself, was wont to say that but one snake, at most, had been 
seen in his chamber.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>Something 
however of popular favour was bequeathed to him from the remembrance of 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>, whose only male descendant he was, and the pity felt for his 
mother <name type="person">Agrippina</name> was increased by the cruelty of <name type="person">Messalina</name>, who, always her 
enemy, and then more furious than ever, was only kept from planning an 
accusation and suborning informers by a new and almost insane passion. She 
had grown so frantically enamoured of <name type="person">Caius Silius</name>, the handsomest of the 
young nobility of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, that she drove from his bed 
<name type="person">Junia Silana</name>, a high-born lady, and had her lover wholly to herself. <name type="person">Silius</name> 
was not unconscious of his wickedness and his peril; but a refusal would 
have insured destruction, and he had some hope of escaping exposure; the 
prize too was great, and so he consoled himself by awaiting the future and 
enjoying the present. As for her, careless of concealment, she went 
continually with a numerous retinue to his house, she haunted his steps, 
showered on him wealth and honours, and, at last, as though empire had 
passed to another, the slaves, the freedmen, the very furniture of the 
emperor were to been seen in the possession of the paramour.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p><name type="person">Claudius</name> meanwhile, who knew nothing about his 
wife, and was busy with his functions as censor, published edicts severely 
rebuking the lawlessness of the people in the theatre, when they insulted 
<name type="person">Caius Pomponius</name>, an ex-consul, who furnished verses for the stage, and 
certain ladies of rank. He introduced too a law restraining the cruel greed 
of the usurers, and forbidding them to lend at interest sums repayable on a 
father's death. He also conveyed by an aqueduct into <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> the waters which flow from the hills of <rs type="placename">Simbrua</rs>. 
And he likewise invented and published for use some new letters, having 
discovered, as he said, that even the Greek alphabet had not been completed 
at once.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>It was the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who 
first symbolized ideas, and 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DIGRESSION ON 
ALPHABET</note>
that by the figures of animals. These records, the most 
ancient of all human history, are still seen engraved on stone. The 
<name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> also claim to have invented the alphabet, which the 
<name type="ethnic">Ph&oelig;nicians</name>, they say, by means of their superior seamanship, 
introduced into <rs type="placename">Greece</rs>, and of which they 
appropriated the glory, giving out that they had discovered what they had 
really been taught. Tradition indeed says that <name type="person">Cadmus</name>, visiting <rs type="placename">Greece</rs> in a Ph&oelig;nician fleet, was the teacher of 
this art to its yet barbarous tribes. According to one account, it was 
<name type="person">Cecrops</name> of <rs type="placename">Athens</rs> or <name type="person">Linus</name> of <rs type="placename">Thebes</rs>, or <name type="person">Palamedes</name> of <rs type="placename">Argos</rs> in 
Trojan times who invented the shapes of sixteen letters, and others, chiefly 
<name type="person">Simonides</name>, added the rest. In <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> the <name type="ethnic">Etrurians</name> 
learnt them from <name type="person">Demaratus</name> of <rs type="placename">Corinth</rs>, and the 
<name type="ethnic">Aborigines</name> from the <placeName key="tgn,2136419">Arcadian</placeName> <name type="person">Evander</name>. And so the Latin letters have the same 
form as the oldest Greek characters. At first too our alphabet was scanty, 
and additions were afterwards made. Following this precedent <name type="person">Claudius</name> added 
three letters, which were employed during his reign and subsequently 
disused. These may still be seen on the tablets of brass set up in the 
squares and temples, on which new statutes are published.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p><name type="person">Claudius</name> then brought before the Senate the subject 
of the college of "haruspices," that, as he said, "the oldest of Italian 
sciences might not be lost through negligence. It had often happened in evil 
days for the State that advisers had been summoned at whose suggestion 
ceremonies had been restored and observed more duly for the future. The 
nobles of <rs type="placename">Etruria</rs>, whether of their own accord or at 
the instigation of the Roman Senate, had retained this science, making it 
the inheritance of distinct families. It was now less zealously studied 
through the general indifference to all sound learning and to the growth of 
foreign superstitions. At present all is well, but we must show gratitude to 
the favour of Heaven, by taking care that the rites observed during times of 
peril may not be forgotten in prosperity." A resolution of the Senate was 
accordingly passed, charging the pontiffs to see what should be retained or 
reformed with respect to the "haruspices."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>It was in this same year that the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name> asked <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> for a king. They had lost all their nobles in their 
civil wars,

and there was left but one scion of the royal house, 
<name type="person">Italicus</name> by name, who lived at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. On the father's 
side he was descended from <name type="person">Flavus</name>, the brother of <name type="person">Arminius</name>; his mother was a 
daughter of <name type="person">Catumerus</name>, chief of the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>. The youth himself was of 
distinguished beauty, a skilful horseman and swordsman both after our 
fashion and that of his country. So the emperor made him a present of money, 
furnished him with an escort, and bade him enter with a good heart on the 
honours of his house. "Never before," he said, "had a native of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, no hostage but a citizen, gone to mount a foreign 
throne." At first his arrival was welcome to the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, and they crowded 
to pay him court, for he was untainted by any spirit of faction, and showed 
the same hearty goodwill to all, practising sometimes the courtesy and 
temperance which can never offend, but oftener those excesses of wine and 
lust in which barbarians delight. He was winning fame among his neighbours 
and even far beyond them, when some who had found their fortune in party 
feuds, jealous of his power, fled to the tribes on the border, protesting 
that <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> was being robbed of her ancient 
freedom, and that the might of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> was on the rise. 
"Is there really," they said, "no native of this country to fill the place 
of king without raising the son of the spy <name type="person">Flavus</name> above all his fellows? It 
is idle to put forward the name of <name type="person">Arminius</name>. Had even the son of <name type="person">Arminius</name> 
come to the throne after growing to manhood on a hostile soil, he might well 
be dreaded, corrupted as he would be by the bread of dependence, by slavery, 
by luxury, by all foreign habits. But if <name type="person">Italicus</name> had his father's spirit, 
no man, be it remembered, had ever waged war against his country and his 
home more savagely than that father."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>By these and like appeals they collected a large force. No less numerous 
were the partisans of <name type="person">Italicus</name>. "He was no intruder," they said, "on an 
unwilling people; he had obeyed a call. Superior as he was to all others in 
noble birth, should they not put his valour to the test, and see whether he 
showed himself worthy of his uncle <name type="person">Arminius</name> and his grandfather <name type="person">Catumerus</name>? 
He need not blush because his father had never relinquished the loyalty 
which, with the consent of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, he had promised to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. The name of liberty was a lying pretext in the 
mouths of men who, base in pri-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PUPPET KING FOR <rs type="placename">CHERUSCI</rs></note>
vate, dangerous in public life, had 
nothing to hope except from civil discord." </p>
<p>The people enthusiastically 
applauded him. After a fierce conflict among the barbarians, the king was 
victorious. Subsequently, in his good fortune, he fell into a despot's 
pride, was dethroned, was restored by the help of the <name type="ethnic">Langobardi</name>, and still, 
in prosperity or adversity, did mischief to the interests of the Cheruscan 
nation.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>It was during the same period 
that the <name type="ethnic">Chauci</name>, free, as it happened, from dissension at home and 
emboldened by the death of <name type="person">Sanquinius</name>, made, while <name type="person">Corbulo</name> was on his way, 
an inroad into <rs type="placename">Lower Germany</rs>, under the leadership 
of <name type="person">Gannascus</name>. This man was of the tribe of the <name type="ethnic">Canninefates</name>, had served long 
as our auxiliary, had then deserted, and, getting some light vessels, had 
made piratical descents specially on the coast of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, inhabited, he knew, by a wealthy and unwarlike 
population. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> meanwhile entered the province with careful preparation 
and soon winning a renown of which that campaign was the beginning, he 
brought his triremes up the channel of the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> and 
the rest of his vessels up the estuaries and canals to which they were 
adapted. Having sunk the enemy's flotilla, driven out <name type="person">Gannascus</name>, and brought 
everything into good order, he restored the discipline of former days among 
legions which had forgotten the labours and toils of the soldier and 
delighted only in plunder. No one was to fall out of the line; no one was to 
fight without orders. At the outposts, on guard, in the duties of day and of 
night, they were always to be under arms. One soldier, it was said, had 
suffered death for working at the trenches without his sword, another for 
wearing nothing as he dug, but his poniard. These extreme and possibly false 
stories at least had their origin in the general's real severity. We may be 
sure that he was strict and implacable to serious offences, when such 
sternness in regard to trifles could be believed of him.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>The fear thus inspired variously affected his own 
troops and the enemy. Our men gained fresh valour; the barbarians felt their 
pride broken. The <name type="ethnic">Frisians</name>, who had been hostile or disloyal since the 
revolt which had been begun by the defeat of <name type="person">Lucius Apronius</name>, gave hostages 
and

settled down on territories marked out by <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, who, at 
the same time, gave them a senate, magistrates, and a constitution. That 
they might not throw off their obedience, he built a fort among them, while 
he sent envoys to invite the <name type="ethnic">Greater Chauci</name> to submission and to destroy 
<name type="person">Gannascus</name> by stratagem. This stealthy attempt on the life of a deserter and 
a traitor was not unsuccessful, nor was it anything ignoble. Yet the <name type="ethnic">Chauci</name> 
were violently roused by the man's death, and <name type="person">Corbulo</name> was now sowing the 
seeds of another revolt, thus getting a reputation which many liked, but of 
which many thought ill. "Why," men asked, "was he irritating the foe? His 
disasters will fall on the State. If he is successful, so famous a hero will 
be a danger to peace, and a formidable subject for a timid emperor." 
<name type="person">Claudius</name> accordingly forbade fresh attacks on <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, so emphatically as to order the garrisons to be 
withdrawn to the left bank of the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name> was actually preparing to encamp on 
hostile soil when the despatch reached him. Surprised, as he was, and many 
as were the thoughts which crowded on him, thoughts of peril from the 
emperor, of scorn from the barbarians, of ridicule from the allies, he said 
nothing but this, "Happy the Roman generals of old," and gave the signal for 
retreat. To keep his soldiers free from sloth, he dug a canal of 
twenty-three miles in length between the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> and 
the <rs type="placename">Meuse</rs>, as a means of avoiding the uncertain 
perils of the ocean. The emperor, though he had forbidden war, yet granted 
him triumphal distinctions. </p>
<p>Soon afterwards <name type="person">Curtius Rufus</name> obtained the 
same honour. He had opened mines in the territory of the <name type="ethnic">Mattiaci</name> for 
working certain veins of silver. The produce was small and soon exhausted. 
The toil meanwhile of the legions was only to a loss, while they dug 
channels for water and constructed below the surface works which are 
difficult enough in the open air. Worn out by the labour, and knowing that 
similar hardships were endured in several provinces, the soldiers wrote a 
secret despatch in the name of the armies, begging the emperor to give in 
advance triumphal distinctions to any one to whom he was about to entrust 
his forces.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>Of the birth of <name type="person">Curtius 
Rufus</name>, whom some affirm to

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CLAUDIUS CHECKS CORBULO'S 
PROGRESS</note>
have been the son of a gladiator, I would not publish a 
falsehood, while I shrink from telling the truth. On reaching manhood he 
attached himself to a qu&aelig;stor to whom <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> 
had been allotted, and was walking alone at midday in some unfrequented 
arcade in the town of <rs type="placename">Adrumetum</rs>, when he saw a 
female figure of more than human stature, and heard a voice, "Thou, <name type="person">Rufus</name>, 
art the man who will one day come into this province as proconsul." Raised 
high in hope by such a presage, he returned to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, 
where, through the lavish expenditure of his friends and his own vigorous 
ability, he obtained the qu&aelig;storship, and, subsequently, in 
competition with well-born candidates, the pr&aelig;torship, by the vote of 
the emperor <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, who threw a veil over the discredit of his origin, 
saying, "<name type="person">Curtius Rufus</name> seems to me to be his own ancestor." Afterwards, 
throughout a long old age of surly sycophancy to those above him, of 
arrogance to those beneath him, and of moroseness among his equals, he 
gained the high office of the consulship, triumphal distinctions, and, at 
last, the province of <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>. There he died, and so 
fulfilled the presage of his destiny.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile, without any motive then known or 
subsequently ascertained, <name type="person">Cneius Nonius</name>, a Roman knight, was found wearing a 
sword amid a crowd who were paying their respects to the emperor. The man 
confessed his own guilt when he was being torn in pieces by torture, but 
gave up no accomplices, perhaps having none to hide. </p>
<p>During the same 
consulship, <name type="person">Publius Dolabella</name> proposed that a spectacle of gladiators should 
be annually exhibited at the cost of those who obtained the 
qu&aelig;storship. In our ancestors' days this honour had been a reward of 
virtue, and every citizen, with good qualities to support him, was allowed 
to compete for office. At first there were no distinctions even of age, 
which prevented a man in his early youth from becoming a consul or a 
dictator. The qu&aelig;stors indeed were appointed while the kings still 
ruled, and this the revival by <name type="person">Brutus</name> of the <foreign lang="la">lex 
curiata</foreign> plainly shows. The consuls retained the power of selecting 
them, till the people bestowed this office as well as others. The first so 
created were <name type="person">Valerius Potitus</name> and <name type="person">&AElig;milius Mamercus</name> sixty-three years 
after the expulsion of the Tarquins, and they were to be attached to

the war-department. As the public business increased, two more were 
appointed to attend to affairs at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. This number 
was again doubled, when to the contributions of <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> was added the tribute of the provinces. 
Subsequently <name type="person">Sulla</name>, by one of his laws, provided that twenty should be 
elected to fill up the Senate, to which he had intrusted judicial functions. 
These functions the knights afterwards recovered, but the qu&aelig;storship 
was obtained, without expense, by merit in the candidates or by the good 
nature of the electors, till at <name type="person">Dolabella</name>'s suggestion it was, so to speak, 
put up to sale.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>In the consulship of 
<name type="person">Aulus Vitellius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Vipstanus</name> the question of filling up the Senate 
was discussed, and the chief men of <rs type="placename">Gallia Comata</rs>, 
as it was called, who had long possessed the rights of allies and of Roman 
citizens, sought the privilege of obtaining public offices at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. There was much talk of every kind on the subject, 
and it was argued before the emperor with vehement opposition. "<rs type="placename">Italy</rs>," it was asserted, "is not so feeble as to be 
unable to furnish its own capital with a senate. Once our native-born 
citizens sufficed for peoples of our own kin, and we are by no means 
dissatisfied with the <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> of the past. To this day 
we cite examples, which under our old customs the Roman character exhibited 
as to valour and renown. Is it a small thing that <name type="ethnic">Veneti</name> and <name type="ethnic">Insubres</name> have 
already burst into the <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs>, unless a mob of foreigners, a troop of 
captives, so to say, is now forced upon us? What distinctions will be left 
for the remnants of our noble houses, or for any impoverished senators from 
<rs type="placename">Latium</rs>? Every place will be crowded with these 
millionaires, whose ancestors of the second and third generations at the 
head of hostile tribes destroyed our armies with fire and sword, and 
actually besieged the divine <name type="person">Julius</name> at <rs type="placename">Alesia</rs>. These 
are recent memories. What if there were to rise up the remembrance of those 
who fell in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s citadel and at her altar by the hands of these same 
barbarians! Let them enjoy indeed the title of citizens, but let them not 
vulgarise the distinctions of the Senate and the honours of office."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>These and like arguments failed to impress 
the emperor. He at once addressed himself to answer them, and

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROVINCIALS AS SENATORS</note>
thus harangued the assembled 
Senate. "My ancestors, the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen 
and a noble of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, encourage me to govern by the 
same policy of transferring to this city all conspicuous merit, wherever 
found. And indeed I know, as facts, that the Julii came from <rs type="placename">Alba</rs>, the Coruncanii from <rs type="placename">Camerium</rs>, the Porcii from <rs type="placename">Tusculum</rs>, and not to inquire too minutely into the past, 
that new members have been brought into the Senate from <rs type="placename">Etruria</rs> and <rs type="placename">Lucania</rs> and the 
whole of <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, that <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> 
itself was at last extended to the <rs type="placename">Alps</rs>, to the end 
that not only single persons but entire countries and tribes might be united 
under our name. We had unshaken peace at home; we prospered in all our 
foreign relations, in the days when <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> beyond the 
<rs type="placename">Po</rs> was admitted to share our citizenship, and when, enrolling in our ranks 
the most vigorous of the provincials, under colour of settling our legions 
throughout the world, we recruited our exhausted empire. Are we sorry that 
the <name type="ethnic">Balbi</name> came to us from <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>, and other men not 
less illustrious from <rs type="placename">Narbon Gaul</rs>? Their descendants 
are still among us, and do not yield to us in patriotism. </p>
<p>"What was the 
ruin of <rs type="placename">Sparta</rs> and <rs type="placename">Athens</rs>, 
but this, that mighty as they were in war, they spurned from them as aliens 
those whom they had conquered? Our founder <name type="person">Romulus</name>, on the other hand, was 
so wise that he fought as enemies and then hailed as fellow-citizens several 
nations on the very same day. Strangers have reigned over us. That 
freedmen's sons should be intrusted with public offices is not, as many 
wrongly think, a sudden innovation, but was a common practice in the old 
commonwealth. But, it will be said, we have fought with the <name type="ethnic">Senones</name>. I 
suppose then that the <name type="ethnic">Volsci</name> and <name type="ethnic">&AElig;qui</name> never stood in array against us. 
Our city was taken by the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>. Well, we also gave hostages to the 
<name type="ethnic">Etruscans</name>, and passed under the yoke of the <name type="ethnic">Samnites</name>. On the whole, if you 
review all our wars, never has one been finished in a shorter time than that 
with the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>. Thenceforth they have preserved an unbroken and loyal peace. 
United as they now are with us by manners, education, and intermarriage, let 
them bring us their gold and their wealth rather than enjoy it in isolation. 
Everything, Senators, which we now hold to be of the highest antiquity, was 
once new.

Plebeian magistrates came after patrician; Latin 
magistrates after plebeian; magistrates of other Italian peoples after 
Latin. This practice too will establish itself, and what we are this day 
justifying by precedents, will be itself a precedent."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>The emperor's speech was followed by a decree of 
the Senate, and the <name type="ethnic">&AElig;dui</name> were the first to obtain the right of 
becoming senators at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. This compliment was paid 
to their ancient alliance, and to the fact that they alone of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> 
cling to the name of brothers of the Roman people. </p>
<p>About the same time 
the emperor enrolled in the ranks of the patricians such senators as were of 
the oldest families, and such as had had distinguished ancestors. There were 
now but scanty relics of the Greater Houses of <name type="person">Romulus</name> and of the Lesser 
Houses of <name type="person">Lucius Brutus</name>, as they had been called, and those too were 
exhausted which the Dictator <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> by the Cassian and the emperor 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> by the S&aelig;nian law had chosen into their place. These acts, as 
being welcome to the State, were undertaken with hearty gladness by the 
imperial censor. Anxiously considering how he was to rid the Senate of men 
of notorious infamy, he preferred a gentle method, recently devised, to one 
which accorded with the sternness of antiquity, and advised each to examine 
his own case and seek the privilege of laying aside his rank. Permission, he 
said, would be readily obtained. He would publish in the same list those who 
had been expelled and those who had been allowed to retire, that by this 
confounding together of the decision of the censors and the modesty of 
voluntary resignation the disgrace might be softened. </p>
<p>For this, the 
consul <name type="person">Vipstanus</name> moved that <name type="person">Claudius</name> should be called "Father of the 
Senate." The title of "Father of the Country" had, he argued, been 
indiscriminately bestowed; new services ought to be recognised by unusual 
titles. The emperor however himself stopped the consul's flattery, as 
extravagant. He closed the lustrum, the census for which gave a total of 
5,984,072 citizens. Then too ended his blindness as to his domestic affairs. 
He was soon compelled to notice and punish his wife's infamies, till he 
afterwards craved passionately for an unhallowed union.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p><name type="person">Messalina</name>, now grown weary of the very facility of 
her adulteries, was rushing into strange excesses, when even

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MESSALINA'S MARRIAGE TO SILIUS</note>
<name type="person">Silius</name>, either through 
some fatal infatuation or because he imagined that, amid the dangers which 
hung over him, danger itself was the best safety, urged the breaking off of 
all concealment. "They were not," he said, "in such an extremity as to have 
to wait for the emperor's old age. Harmless measures were for the innocent. 
Crime once exposed had no refuge but in audacity. They had accomplices in 
all who feared the same fate. For himself, as he had neither wife nor child, 
he was ready to marry and to adopt <name type="person">Britannicus</name>. <name type="person">Messalina</name> would have the 
same power as before, with the additional advantage of a quiet mind, if only 
they took <name type="person">Claudius</name>' by surprise, who, though unsuspicious of treachery, was 
hasty in his wrath." </p>
<p>The suggestion was coldly received, not because the 
lady loved her husband, but from a fear that <name type="person">Silius</name>, after attaining his 
highest hopes, would spurn an adulteress, and soon estimate at its true 
value the crime which in the midst of peril he had approved. But she craved 
the name of wife, for the sake of the monstrous infamy, that last source of 
delight to the reckless. She waited only till <name type="person">Claudius</name> set out for <rs type="placename">Ostia</rs> to perform a sacrifice, and then celebrated all 
the solemnities of marriage.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>I am well 
aware that it will seem a fable that any persons in the world could have 
been so obtuse in a city which knows everything and hides nothing, much 
more, that these persons should have been a consul-elect and the emperor's 
wife; that, on an appointed day, before witnesses duly summoned, they should 
have come together as if for the purpose of legitimate marriage; that she 
should have listened to the words of the bridegroom's friends, should have 
sacrificed to the gods, have taken her place among a company of guests, have 
lavished her kisses and caresses, and passed the night in the freedom which 
marriage permits. But this is no story to excite wonder; I do but relate 
what I have heard and what our fathers have recorded.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>The emperor's court indeed shuddered, its powerful 
personages especially, the men who had much to fear from a revolution. From 
secret whisperings they passed to loud complaints. "When an actor," they 
said, "impudently thrust himself into the imperial chamber, it certainly 
brought scan-

dal on the State, but we were a long way from ruin. 
Now, a young noble of stately beauty, of vigorous intellect, with the near 
prospect of the consulship, is preparing himself for a loftier ambition. 
There can be no secret about what is to follow such a marriage." Doubtless 
there was a thrill of alarm when they thought of the apathy of <name type="person">Claudius</name>, of 
his devotion to his wife and of the many murders perpetrated at <name type="person">Messalina</name>'s 
bidding. On the other hand, the very good nature of the emperor inspired 
confident hope that if they could overpower him by the enormity of the 
charge, she might be condemned and crushed before she was accused. The 
critical point was this, that he should not hear her defence, and that his 
ears should be shut even against her confession.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>At first <name type="person">Callistus</name>, of whom I have already spoken in connection 
with the assassination of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, <name type="person">Narcissus</name>, who had contrived 
the death of <name type="person">Appius</name>, and <name type="person">Pallas</name>, who was then in the height of favour, 
debated whether they might not by secret threats turn <name type="person">Messalina</name> from her 
passion for <name type="person">Silius</name>, while they concealed all else. Then fearing that they 
would be themselves involved in ruin, they abandoned the idea, <name type="person">Pallas</name> out of 
cowardice, and <name type="person">Callistus</name>, from his experience of a former court, remembering 
that prudent rather than vigorous counsels insure the maintenance of power. 
<name type="person">Narcissus</name> persevered, only so far changing his plan as not to make her aware 
beforehand by a single word what was the charge or who was the accuser. Then 
he eagerly watched his opportunity, and, as the emperor lingered long at <rs type="placename">Ostia</rs>, he sought two of the mistresses to whose society 
<name type="person">Claudius</name> was especially partial, and, by gifts, by promises, by dwelling on 
power increased by the wife's fall, he induced them to undertake the work of 
the informer.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>On this, <name type="person">Calpurnia</name> 
(that was the woman's name), as soon as she was allowed a private interview, 
threw herself at the emperor's knees, crying out that <name type="person">Messalina</name> was married 
to <name type="person">Silius</name>. At the same time she asked <name type="person">Cleopatra</name>, who was standing near and 
waiting for the question, whether she knew it. <name type="person">Cleopatra</name> nodding assent, she 
begged that <name type="person">Narcissus</name> might be summoned. <name type="person">Narcissus</name> entreated pardon for the 
past, for having concealed the scandal while confined to a <name type="person">Vettius</name> or a 
<name type="person">Plautius</name>. Even now, he said, he would not

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CLAUDIUS LEARNS 
OF SCANDAL</note>
make charges of adultery, and seem to be asking back the 
palace, the slaves, and the other belongings of imperial rank. These <name type="person">Silius</name> 
might enjoy; only, he must give back the wife and annul the act of marriage. 
"Do you know," he said, "of your divorce? The people, the army, the Senate 
saw the marriage of <name type="person">Silius</name>. Act at once, or the new husband is master of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p><name type="person">Claudius</name> 
then summoned all his most powerful friends. First he questioned <name type="person">Turranius</name>, 
superintendent of the corn market; next, <name type="person">Lusius Geta</name>, who commanded the 
pr&aelig;torians. When they confessed the truth, the whole company clamoured 
in concert that he must go to the camp, must assure himself of the 
pr&aelig;torian cohorts, must think of safety before he thought of 
vengeance. It is quite certain that <name type="person">Claudius</name> was so overwhelmed by terror 
that he repeatedly asked whether he was indeed in possession of the empire, 
whether <name type="person">Silius</name> was still a subject. </p>
<p><name type="person">Messalina</name> meanwhile, more wildly 
profligate than ever, was celebrating in mid autumn a representation of the 
vintage in her new home. The presses were being trodden; the vats were 
overflowing; women girt with skins were dancing, as Bacchanals dance in 
their worship or their frenzy. <name type="person">Messalina</name> with flowing hair shook the 
thyrsus, and <name type="person">Silius</name> at her side, crowned with ivy and wearing the buskin, 
moved his head to some lascivious chorus. It is said that one <name type="person">Vettius Valens</name> 
climbed a very lofty tree in sport, and when they asked him what he saw, 
replied, "A terrible storm from <rs type="placename">Ostia</rs>." Possibly 
some such appearance had begun; perhaps, a word dropped by chance became a 
prophecy.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>Meanwhile no mere rumour 
but messengers from all parts brought the news that everything was known to 
<name type="person">Claudius</name>, and that he was coming, bent on vengeance. <name type="person">Messalina</name> upon this 
went to the gardens of <name type="person">Lucullus</name>; <name type="person">Silius</name>, to conceal his fear, to his 
business in the forum. The other guests were flying in all directions when 
the centurions appeared and put every one in irons where they found them, 
either in the public streets or in hiding. <name type="person">Messalina</name>, though her peril took 
away all power of thought, promptly resolved to meet and face her husband, a 
course in which she had often found safety; while she bade <name type="person">Britannicus</name> and 
<name type="person">Octavia</name> hasten to

embrace their father. She besought <name type="person">Vibidia</name>, the 
eldest of the Vestal Virgins, to demand audience of the supreme pontiff and 
to beg for mercy. Meanwhile, with only three companions, so lonely did she 
find herself in a moment, she traversed the whole length of the city, and, 
mounting on a cart used to remove garden refuse, proceeded along the road to 
<rs type="placename">Ostia</rs>; not pitied, so overpoweringly hideous were 
her crimes, by a single person.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>There 
was equal alarm on the emperor's side. They put but little trust in <name type="person">Geta</name>, 
who commanded the pr&aelig;torians, a man swayed with equal ease to good or 
evil. <name type="person">Narcissus</name> in concert with others who dreaded the same fate, declared 
that the only hope of safety for the emperor lay in his transferring for 
that one day the command of the soldiers to one of the freedmen, and he 
offered to undertake it himself. And that <name type="person">Claudius</name> might not be induced by 
<name type="person">Lucius Vitellius</name> and <name type="person">Largus C&aelig;cina</name> to repent, while he was riding into 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, he asked and took a seat in the emperor's 
carriage.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>It was currently reported 
in after times that while the emperor broke into contradictory exclamations, 
now inveighing against the infamies of his wife, and now returning in 
thought to the remembrance of his love and of his infant children, Vitellius 
said nothing but, "What audacity! what wickedness!" <name type="person">Narcissus</name> indeed kept 
pressing him to clear up his ambiguities and let the truth be known, but 
still he could not prevail upon him to utter anything that was not vague and 
susceptible of any meaning which might be put on it, or upon <name type="person">Largus 
C&aelig;cina</name>, to do anything but follow his example. And now <name type="person">Messalina</name> had 
presented herself, and was insisting that the emperor should listen to the 
mother of <name type="person">Octavia</name> and <name type="person">Britannicus</name>, when the accuser roared out at her the 
story of <name type="person">Silius</name> and her marriage. At the same moment, to draw <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s 
eyes away from her, he handed him some papers which detailed her 
debaucheries. Soon afterwards, as he was entering <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, his children by <name type="person">Messalina</name> were to have shown 
themselves, had not <name type="person">Narcissus</name> ordered their removal. <name type="person">Vibidia</name> he could not 
repel, when, with a vehemently indignant appeal, she demanded that a wife 
should not be given up to death without a hearing. So <name type="person">Narcissus</name> replied that 
the emperor would hear her, and that she should have an oppor-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NARCISSUS' MANIPULATIONS</note>
tunity of disproving the 
charge. Meanwhile the holy virgin was to go and discharge her sacred 
duties.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>All throughout, <name type="person">Claudius</name> 
preserved a strange silence; <name type="person">Vitellius</name> seemed unconscious. Everything was 
under the freedman's control. By his order, the paramour's house was thrown 
open and the emperor conducted thither. First, on the threshold, he pointed 
out the statue of <name type="person">Silius</name>'s father, which a decree of the Senate had directed 
to be destroyed; next, how the heirlooms of the Neros and the Drusi had been 
degraded into the price of infamy. Then he led the emperor, furious and 
bursting out in menace, into the camp, where the soldiers were purposely 
assembled. <name type="person">Claudius</name> spoke to them a few words at the dictation of <name type="person">Narcissus</name>. 
Shame indeed checked the utterance even of a righteous anger. Instantly 
there came a shout from the cohorts, demanding the names of the culprits and 
their punishment. Brought before the tribunal, <name type="person">Silius</name> sought neither defence 
nor delay, but begged that his death might be hastened. A like courage made 
several Roman knights of the first rank desirous of a speedy doom. <name type="person">Titius 
Proculus</name>, who had been appointed to watch <name type="person">Messalina</name> and was now offering his 
evidence, <name type="person">Vettius Valens</name>, who confessed his guilt, together with <name type="person">Pompeius 
Urbicus</name> and <name type="person">Saufellus Trogus</name> from among her accomplices, were ordered to 
execution. <name type="person">Decius Calpurnianus</name> too, commander of the watch, <name type="person">Sulpicius Rufus</name>, 
who had the charge of the Games, and <name type="person">Juncus Virgilianus</name>, a senator, were 
similarly punished.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p><name type="person">Mnester</name> alone 
occasioned a pause. Rending off his clothes, he insisted on <name type="person">Claudius</name> looking 
at the scars of his stripes and remembering his words when he surrendered 
himself, without reserve, to <name type="person">Messalina</name>'s bidding. The guilt of others had 
been the result of presents or of large promises; his, of necessity. He must 
have been the first victim had <name type="person">Silius</name> obtained empire. </p>
<p><name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> was 
touched by his appeal and inclined to mercy, but his freedmen prevailed on 
him not to let any indulgence be shown to a player when so many illustrious 
citizens had fallen. "It mattered not whether he had sinned so greatly from 
choice or compulsion." Even the defence of <name type="person">Traulus Montanus</name>, a Roman knight, 
was not admitted. A young

man of pure life, yet of singular 
beauty, he had been summoned and dismissed within the space of one night by 
<name type="person">Messalina</name>, who was equally capricious in her passions and dislikes. In the 
cases of <name type="person">Suilius C&aelig;soninus</name> and <name type="person">Plautius Lateranus</name>, the extreme penalty 
was remitted. The latter was saved by the distinguished services of his 
uncle; the former by his very vices, having amid that abominable throng 
submitted to the worst degradation.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p><name type="person">Messalina</name> meanwhile, in the gardens of <name type="person">Lucullus</name>, was struggling for life, 
and writing letters of entreaty, as she alternated between hope and fury. In 
her extremity, it was her pride alone which forsook her. Had not <name type="person">Narcissus</name> 
hurried on her death, ruin would have recoiled on her accuser. <name type="person">Claudius</name> had 
returned home to an early banquet; then, in softened mood, when the wine had 
warmed him, he bade some one go and tell the "poor creature" (this is the 
word which they say he used) to come on the morrow and plead her cause. 
Hearing this, seeing too that his wrath was subsiding and his passion 
returning, and fearing, in the event of delay, the effect of approaching 
night and conjugal recollections, <name type="person">Narcissus</name> rushed out, and ordered the 
centurions and the tribunes, who were on guard, to accomplish the deed of 
blood. Such, he said, was the emperor's bidding. <name type="person">Evodus</name>, one of the 
freedmen, was appointed to watch and complete the affair. Hurrying on before 
with all speed to the gardens, he found <name type="person">Messalina</name> stretched upon the ground, 
while by her side sat <name type="person">Lepida</name>, her mother, who, though estranged from her 
daughter in prosperity, was now melted to pity by her inevitable doom, and 
urged her not to wait for the executioner. "Life," she said, "was over; all 
that could be looked for was honour in death." But in that heart, utterly 
corrupted by profligacy, nothing noble remained. She still prolonged her 
tears and idle complaints, till the gates were forced open by the rush of 
the new comers, and there stood at her side the tribune, sternly silent, and 
the freedman, overwhelming her with the copious insults of a servile 
tongue.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>Then for the first time she 
understood her fate and put her hand to a dagger. In her terror she was 
applying it ineffectually to her throat and breast, when a blow from the 
tribune drove it through her. Her body was given up to her

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DEATH OF MESSALINA</note>
mother. <name type="person">Claudius</name> was still at the 
banquet when they told him that <name type="person">Messalina</name> was dead, without mentioning 
whether it was by her own or another's hand. Nor did he ask the question, 
but called for the cup and finished his repast as usual. During the days 
which followed he showed no sign of hatred or joy or anger or sadness, in a 
word, of any human emotion, either when he looked on her triumphant accusers 
or on her weeping children. The Senate assisted his forgetfulness by 
decreeing that her name and her statues should be removed from all places, 
public or private. To <name type="person">Narcissus</name> were voted the decorations of the 
qu&aelig;storship, a mere trifle to the pride of one who rose in the height 
of his power above <name type="person">Pallas</name> and <name type="person">Callistus</name>.</p></div2></div1>

<div1 type="book" n="12">
<head>BOOK XII</head>
<head><dateRange from="48" to="54">A.D. 48&mdash;54</dateRange></head> <div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>THE destruction of <name type="person">Messalina</name> shook the imperial house; for a 
strife arose among the freedmen, who should choose a wife for <name type="person">Claudius</name>, 
impatient as he was of a single life and submissive to the rule of wives. 
The ladies were fired with no less jealousy. Each insisted on her rank, 
beauty, and fortune, and pointed to her claims to such a marriage. But the 
keenest competition was between <name type="person">Lollia Paulina</name>, the daughter of <name type="person">Marcus 
Lollius</name>, an ex-consul, and <name type="person">Julia Agrippina</name>, the daughter of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. 
<name type="person">Callistus</name> favoured the first, <name type="person">Pallas</name> the second. <name type="person">&AElig;lia P&aelig;tina</name> 
however, of the family of the Tuberones, had the support of <name type="person">Narcissus</name>. The 
emperor, who inclined now one way, now another, as he listened to this or 
that adviser, summoned the disputants to a conference and bade them express 
their opinions and give their reasons.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p><name type="person">Narcissus</name> dwelt on the marriage of years gone by, on the tie of offspring, 
for <name type="person">P&aelig;tina</name> was the mother of <name type="person">Antonia</name>, and on the advantage of 
excluding a new element from his household, by the return of a wife to whom 
he was accustomed, and who would assuredly not look with a stepmother's 
animosity on <name type="person">Britannicus</name> and <name type="person">Octavia</name>, who were next in her affections to her 
own children. <name type="person">Callistus</name> argued that she was compromised by her long 
separation, and that were she to be taken back, she would be supercilious on 
the strength of it. It would be far better to introduce <name type="person">Lollia</name>, for, as she 
had no children of her own, she would be free from jealousy, and would take 
the place of a mother towards her stepchildren. </p>
<p><name type="person">Pallas</name> again selected 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name> for special commendation because she would bring with her 
<name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s grandson, who was thoroughly worthy of imperial rank, the scion 
of a noble house and a link to unite the descendants of the Claudian 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">RIVALS FOR MARRIAGE WITH CLAUDIUS</note> family. He hoped 
that a woman who was the mother of many children and still in the freshness 
of youth, would not carry off the grandeur of the C&aelig;sars to some other 
house.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>This advice prevailed, backed up 
as it was by <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s charms. On the pretext of her relationship, she 
paid frequent visits to her uncle, and so won his heart, that she was 
preferred to the others, and, though not yet his wife, already possessed a 
wife's power. For as soon as she was sure of her marriage, she began to aim 
at greater things, and planned an alliance between <name type="person">Domitius</name>, her son by 
<name type="person">Cneius &AElig;nobarbus</name>, and <name type="person">Octavia</name>, the emperor's daughter. This could not 
be accomplished without a crime, for the emperor had betrothed <name type="person">Octavia</name> to 
<name type="person">Lucius Silanus</name>, a young man otherwise famous, whom he had brought forward as 
a candidate for popular favour by the honour of triumphal distinctions and 
by a magnificent gladiatorial show. But no difficulty seemed to be presented 
by the temper of a sovereign who had neither partialities nor dislikes, but 
such as were suggested and dictated to him.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p><name type="person">Vitellius</name> accordingly, who used the name of censor to screen a 
slave's trickeries, and looked forward to new despotisms, already impending, 
associated himself in <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s plans, with a view to her favour, and 
began to bring charges against <name type="person">Silanus</name>, whose sister, <name type="person">Junia Calvina</name>, a 
handsome and lively girl, had shortly before become his daughter-in-law. 
Here was a starting point for an accuser. <name type="person">Vitellius</name> put an infamous 
construction on the somewhat incautious though not criminal love between the 
brother and sister. The emperor listened, for his affection for his daughter 
inclined him the more to admit suspicions against his son-in-law. <name type="person">Silanus</name> 
meanwhile, who knew nothing of the plot, and happened that year to be 
pr&aelig;tor, was suddenly expelled from the Senate by an edict of 
<name type="person">Vitellius</name>, though the roll of Senators had been recently reviewed and the 
lustrum closed. <name type="person">Claudius</name> at the same time broke off the connection; <name type="person">Silanus</name> 
was forced to resign his office, and the one remaining day of his 
pr&aelig;torship was conferred on <name type="person">Eprius Marcellus</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>In the year of the consulship of <name type="person">Caius Pompeius</name> and 
<name type="person">Quintus Veranius</name>, the marriage arranged between <name type="person">Claudius</name> and <name type="person">Agrippina</name> was 
confirmed both by popular rumour and

by their own illicit love. 
Still, they did not yet dare to celebrate the nuptials in due form, for 
there was no precedent for the introduction of a niece into an uncle's 
house. It was positively incest, and if disregarded, it would, people 
feared, issue in calamity to the State. These scruples ceased not till 
<name type="person">Vitellius</name> undertook the management of the matter in his own way. He asked 
the emperor whether he would yield to the recommendations of the people and 
to the authority of the Senate. When <name type="person">Claudius</name> replied that he was one among 
the citizens and could not resist their unanimous voice, <name type="person">Vitellius</name> requested 
him to wait in the palace, while he himself went to the Senate. Protesting 
that the supreme interest of the commonwealth was at stake, he begged to be 
allowed to speak first, and then began to urge that the very burdensome 
labours of the emperor in a world-wide administration, required assistance, 
so that free from domestic cares, he might consult the public welfare. How 
again could there be a more virtuous relief for the mind of an imperial 
censor than the taking of a wife to share his prosperity and his troubles, 
in whom he might intrust his inmost thoughts and the care of his young 
children, unused as he was to luxury and pleasure, and wont from his 
earliest youth to obey the laws.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p><name type="person">Vitellius</name>, having first put forward these arguments in a conciliatory 
speech, and met with decided acquiescence from the Senate, began afresh to 
point out, that, as they all recommended the emperor's marriage, they ought 
to select a lady conspicuous for noble rank and purity, herself too the 
mother of children. "It cannot," he said, "be long a question that <name type="person">Agrippina</name> 
stands first in nobility of birth. She has given proof too that she is not 
barren, and she has suitable moral qualities. It is, again, a singular 
advantage to us, due to divine providence, for a widow to be united to an 
emperor who has limited himself to his own lawful wives. We have heard from 
our fathers, we have ourselves seen that married women were seized at the 
caprice of the C&aelig;sars. This is quite alien to the propriety of our 
day. Rather let a precedent be now set for the taking of a wife by an 
emperor. But, it will be said marriage with a brother's daughter is with us 
a novelty. True; but it is common in other countries, and there is no law to 
forbid it. Marriages of cousins were long unknown,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AGRIPPINA MADE QUEEN</note> 
but after a time they became 
frequent. Custom adapts itself to expediency, and this novelty will 
hereafter take its place among recognized usages."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>There were some who rushed out of the Senate, 
passionately protesting that if the emperor hesitated, they would use 
violence. A promiscuous throng assembled, and kept exclaiming that the same 
too was the prayer of the Roman people. <name type="person">Claudius</name> without further delay 
presented himself in the forum to their congratulations; then entering the 
Senate he asked from them a decree which should decide that for the future 
marriages between uncles and brothers' daughters should be legal. There was, 
however, found only one person who desired such a marriage, <name type="person">Alledius 
Severus</name>, a Roman knight, who, as many said, was swayed by the influence of 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>. Then came a revolution in the State, and everything was under the 
control of a woman, who did not, like <name type="person">Messalina</name>, insult <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> by loose manners. It was a stringent, and, so to 
say, masculine despotism; there was sternness and generally arrogance in 
public, no sort of immodesty at home, unless it conduced to power. A 
boundless greed of wealth was veiled under the pretext that riches were 
being accumulated as a prop to the throne.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>On the day of the marriage <name type="person">Silanus</name> committed suicide, having up to 
that time prolonged his hope of life, or else choosing that day to heighten 
the popular indignation. His sister, <name type="person">Calvina</name>, was banished from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. <name type="person">Claudius</name> further added that sacrifices after the 
ordinances of King <name type="person">Tullius</name>, and atonements were to be offered by the 
pontiffs in the grove of <name type="person">Diana</name>, amid general ridicule at the idea of 
devising penalties and propitiations for incest at such a time. <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, 
that she might not be conspicuous only by her evil deeds, procured for 
<name type="person">Ann&aelig;us Seneca</name> a remission of his exile, and with it the 
pr&aelig;torship. She thought this would be universally welcome, from the 
celebrity of his attainments, and it was her wish too for the boyhood of 
<name type="person">Domitius</name> to be trained under so excellent an instructor, and for them to 
have the benefit of his counsels in their designs on the throne. For <name type="person">Seneca</name>, 
it was believed, was devoted to <name type="person">Agrippina</name> from a remembrance of her 
kindness, and an enemy to <name type="person">Claudius</name> from a bitter sense of wrong.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>It was then resolved to delay no longer. 
<name type="person">Memmius Pollio</name>, the consul-elect, was induced by great promises to deliver a 
speech, praying <name type="person">Claudius</name> to betroth <name type="person">Octavia</name> to <name type="person">Domitius</name>. The match was not 
unsuitable to the age of either, and was likely to develop still more 
important results. <name type="person">Pollio</name> introduced the motion in much the same language as 
<name type="person">Vitellius</name> had lately used. So <name type="person">Octavia</name> was betrothed, and <name type="person">Domitius</name>, besides 
his previous relationship, became now the emperor's affianced son-in-law, 
and an equal of <name type="person">Britannicus</name>, through the exertions of his mother and the 
cunning of those who had been the accusers of <name type="person">Messalina</name>, and feared the 
vengeance of her son.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>About the same 
time an embassy from the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, which had been sent, as I have stated, 
to solicit the return of <name type="person">Meherdates</name>, was introduced into the Senate, and 
delivered a message to the following effect:&mdash;"They were not," they 
said, "unaware of the treaty of alliance, nor did their coming imply any 
revolt from the family of the Arsacids; indeed, even the son of <name type="person">Vonones</name>, 
<name type="person">Phraates</name>'s grandson, was with them in their resistance to the despotism of 
<name type="person">Gotarzes</name>, which was alike intolerable to the nobility and to the people. 
Already brothers, relatives, and distant kin had been swept off by murder 
after murder; wives actually pregnant, and tender children were added to 
<name type="person">Gotarzes</name>' victims, while, slothful at home and unsuccessful in war, he made 
cruelty a screen for his feebleness. Between the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> and ourselves 
there was an ancient friendship, founded on a state alliance, and we ought 
to support allies who were our rivals in strength, and yet yielded to us out 
of respect. Kings' sons were given as hostages, in order that when <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> was tired of home rule, it might fall back on 
the emperor and the Senate, and receive from them a better sovereign, 
familiar with Roman habits."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>In 
answer to these and like arguments <name type="person">Claudius</name> began to speak of the grandeur 
of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and the submissive attitude of the 
<name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>. He compared himself to the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, from whom, he 
reminded them, they had sought a king, but omitted to mention <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, 
though he too had sent them sovereigns. He added some advice for Meherdates, 
who was present, and told him not to be thinking of a despot

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MEHERDATES MADE PARTHIAN KING</note>
and his slaves, but rather 
of a ruler among fellow citizens and to practise clemency and justice which 
barbarians would like the more for being unused to them. Then he turned to 
the envoys and bestowed high praise on the young foster-son of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, as one whose self-control had hitherto been 
exemplary. "Still," he said, "they must bear with the caprices of kings, and 
frequent revolutions were bad. <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, sated with her 
glory, had reached such a height that she wished even foreign nations to 
enjoy repose." Upon this <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name>, governor of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, was commissioned to escort the young prince to 
the bank of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p><name type="person">Cassius</name> was at that time preeminent for legal 
learning. The profession of the soldier is forgotten in a quiet period, and 
peace reduces the enterprising and indolent to an equality. But <name type="person">Cassius</name>, as 
far as it was possible without war, revived ancient discipline, kept 
exercising the legions, in short, used as much diligence and precaution as 
if an enemy were threatening him. This conduct he counted worthy of his 
ancestors and of the Cassian family which had won renown even in those 
countries. </p>
<p>He then summoned those at whose suggestion a king had been 
sought from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and having encamped at <rs type="placename">Zeugma</rs> where the river was most easily fordable and 
awaited the arrival of the chief men of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> and 
of <name type="person">Acbarus</name>, king of the <name type="ethnic">Arabs</name>, he reminded <name type="person">Meherdates</name> that the impulsive 
enthusiasm of barbarians soon flags from delay or even changes into 
treachery, and that therefore he should urge on his enterprise. The advice 
was disregarded through the perfidy of <name type="person">Acbarus</name>, by whom the foolish young 
prince, who thought that the highest position merely meant self-indulgence, 
was detained for several days in the town of <rs type="placename">Edessa</rs>. 
Although a certain <name type="person">Carenes</name> pressed them to come and promised easy success if 
they hastened their arrival, they did not make for <rs type="placename">Mesopotamia</rs>, which was close to them, but, by a long 
d&eacute;tour, for <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, then ill-suited to their 
movements, as winter was beginning.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>As they approached the plains, wearied with the snows and mountains, they 
were joined by the forces of <name type="person">Carenes</name>, and having crossed the river <rs type="placename">Tigris</rs> they traversed the country of the <name type="ethnic">Adiabeni</name>, whose 
king <name type="person">Izates</name> had avowedly em-

braced the alliance of <name type="person">Meherdates</name>, 
though secretly and in better faith he inclined to <name type="person">Gotarzes</name>. In their march 
they captured the city of <rs type="placename">Ninos</rs>, the most ancient 
capital of <rs type="placename">Assyria</rs>, and a fortress, historically 
famous, as the spot where in the last battle between <name type="person">Darius</name> and <name type="person">Alexander</name> 
the power of <rs type="placename">Persia</rs> fell. <name type="person">Gotarzes</name> meantime was 
offering vows to the local divinities on a mountain called <rs type="placename">Sambulos</rs>, with special worship of <name type="person">Hercules</name>, who at a 
stated time bids the priests in a dream equip horses for the chase and place 
them near his temple. When the horses have been laden with quivers full of 
arrows, they scour the forest and at length return at night with empty 
quivers, panting violently. Again the god in a vision of the night reveals 
to them the track along which he roamed through the woods, and everywhere 
slaughtered beasts are found.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p><name type="person">Gotarzes</name>, his army not being yet in sufficient force, made the river <rs type="placename">Corma</rs> a line of defence, and though he was challenged to 
an engagement by taunting messages, he contrived delays, shifted his 
positions and sent emissaries to corrupt the enemy and bribe them to throw 
off their allegiance. <name type="person">Izates</name> of the <name type="ethnic">Adiabeni</name> and then <name type="person">Acbarus</name> of the <name type="ethnic">Arabs</name> 
deserted with their troops, with their countrymen's characteristic 
fickleness, confirming previous experience, that barbarians prefer to seek a 
king from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> than to keep him. <name type="person">Meherdates</name>, stript 
of his powerful auxiliaries and suspecting treachery in the rest, resolved, 
as his last resource, to risk everything and try the issue of a battle. Nor 
did <name type="person">Gotarzes</name>, who was emboldened by the enemy's diminished strength, refuse 
the challenge. They fought with terrible courage and doubtful result, till 
<name type="person">Carenes</name>, who having beaten down all resistance had advanced too far, was 
surprised by a fresh detachment in his rear. Then <name type="person">Meherdates</name> in despair 
yielded to promises from <name type="person">Parrhaces</name>, one of his father's adherents, and was 
by his treachery delivered in chains to the conqueror. <name type="person">Gotarzes</name> taunted him 
with being no kinsman of his or of the Arsacids, but a foreigner and a 
<name type="ethnic">Roman</name>, and having cut off his ears, bade him live, a memorial of his own 
clemency, and a disgrace to us. After this <name type="person">Gotarzes</name> fell ill and died, and 
<name type="person">Vonones</name>, who then ruled the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name>, was summoned to the throne. He was 
memorable neither for his good

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">VONONES KING, MITHRIDATES 
REBELS</note>
nor bad fortune; he completed a short and inglorious reign, 
and then the empire of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> passed to his son 
<name type="person">Vologeses</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>Mithridates of <rs type="placename">Bosporus</rs>, meanwhile, who had lost his power and was a 
mere outcast, on learning that the Roman general, <name type="person">Didius</name>, and the main 
strength of his army had retired, and that <name type="person">Cotys</name>, a young prince without 
experience, was left in his new kingdom with a few cohorts under <name type="person">Julius 
Aquila</name>, a Roman knight, disdaining both, roused the neighbouring tribes, and 
drew deserters to his standard. At last he collected an army, drove out the 
king of the <name type="ethnic">Dandarid&aelig;</name>, and possessed himself of his dominions. When 
this was known, and the invasion of <rs type="placename">Bosporus</rs> was 
every moment expected, <name type="person">Aquila</name> and <name type="person">Cotys</name>, seeing that hostilities had been 
also resumed by <name type="person">Zorsines</name>, king of the <name type="ethnic">Siraci</name>, distrusted their own strength, 
and themselves too sought the friendship of the foreigner by sending envoys 
to <name type="person">Eunones</name>, who was then chief of the <name type="ethnic">Adorsi</name>. There was no difficulty about 
alliance, when they pointed to the power of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> in 
contrast with the rebel <name type="person">Mithridates</name>. It was accordingly stipulated that 
<name type="person">Eunones</name> should engage the enemy with his cavalry, and the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> undertake 
the siege of towns.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>Then the army 
advanced in regular formation, the <name type="ethnic">Adorsi</name> in the van and the rear, while the 
centre was strengthened by the cohorts, and native troops of <rs type="placename">Bosporus</rs> with Roman arms. Thus the enemy was defeated, 
and they reached <rs type="placename">Soza</rs>, a town in <rs type="placename">Dandarica</rs>, which <name type="person">Mithridates</name> had abandoned, where it was 
thought expedient to leave a garrison, as the temper of the people was 
uncertain. Next they marched on the <name type="ethnic">Siraci</name>, and after crossing the river <rs type="placename">Panda</rs> besieged the city of <rs type="placename">Uspe</rs>, 
which stood on high ground, and had the defence of walls and fosses; only 
the walls, not being of stone, but of hurdles and wicker-work with earth 
between, were too weak to resist an assault. Towers were raised to a greater 
height as a means of annoying the besieged with brands and darts. Had not 
night stopped the conflict, the siege would have been begun and finished 
within one day.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>Next day they sent an 
embassy asking mercy for the freeborn, and offering ten thousand slaves. As 
it would have been inhuman to slay the prisoners, and very difficult to 
keep

them under guard, the conquerors rejected the offers 
preferring that they should perish by the just doom of war. The signal for 
massacre was therefore given to the soldiers, who had mounted the walls by 
scaling ladders. The destruction of <rs type="placename">Uspe</rs> struck 
terror into the rest of the people, who thought safety impossible when they 
saw how armies and ramparts, heights and difficult positions, rivers and 
cities, alike yielded to their foe. And so <name type="person">Zorsines</name>, having long considered 
whether he should still have regard to the fallen fortunes of <name type="person">Mithridates</name> or 
to the kingdom of his fathers, and having at last preferred his country's 
interests, gave hostages and prostrated himself before the emperor's image, 
to the great glory of the Roman army, which all men knew to have come after 
a bloodless victory within three days' march of the river <rs type="placename">Tanais</rs>. In their return however fortune was not equally 
favourable; some of their vessels, as they were sailing back, were driven on 
the shores of the <name type="ethnic">Tauri</name> and cut off by the barbarians, who slew the 
commander of a cohort and several auxiliaries.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>Meanwhile <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, finding arms an unavailing resource, 
considered on whose mercy he was to throw himself. He feared his brother 
<name type="person">Cotys</name>, who had once been a traitor, then become his open enemy. No <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> was 
on the spot of authority sufficient to make his promises highly valued. So 
he turned to <name type="person">Eunones</name>, who had no personal animosity against him, and had 
been lately strengthened by his alliance with us. Adapting his dress and 
expression of countenance as much as possible to his present condition, he 
entered the palace, and throwing himself at the feet of <name type="person">Eunones</name> he 
exclaimed, "<name type="person">Mithridates</name>, whom the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> have sought so many years by land 
and sea, stands before you by his own choice. Deal as you please with the 
descendant of the great <name type="person">Ach&aelig;menes</name>, the only glory of which enemies 
have not robbed me."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>The great name 
of <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, his reverse, his prayer, full of dignity, deeply affected 
<name type="person">Eunones</name>. He raised the suppliant, and commended him for having chosen the 
nation of the <name type="ethnic">Adorsi</name> and his own good faith in suing for mercy. He sent at 
the same time envoys to <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> with a letter to this effect, that 
friendship between emperors of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and sov-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MITHRIDATES BROUGHT TO <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note> 

ereigns of powerful peoples was primarily based on a similarity of fortune, 
and that between himself and <name type="person">Claudius</name> there was the tie of a common victory. 
Wars had glorious endings, whenever matters were settled by an amnesty. The 
conquered <name type="person">Zorsines</name> had on this principle been deprived of nothing. For 
<name type="person">Mithridates</name>, as he deserved heavier punishment, he asked neither power nor 
dominions, only that he might not be led in triumph, and pay the penalty of 
death.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p><name type="person">Claudius</name>, though merciful to 
foreign princes, was yet in doubt whether it were better to receive the 
captive with a promise of safety or to claim his surrender by the sword. To 
this last he was urged by resentment at his wrongs, and by thirst for 
vengeance. On the other hand it was argued that it would be undertaking a 
war in a country without roads, on a harbourless sea, against warlike kings 
and wandering tribes, on a barren soil; that a weary disgust would come of 
tardy movements, and perils of precipitancy; that the glory of victory would 
be small, while much disgrace would ensue on defeat. Why should not the 
emperor seize the offer and spare the exile, whose punishment would be the 
greater, the longer he lived in poverty? </p>
<p>Moved by these considerations, 
<name type="person">Claudius</name> wrote to <name type="person">Eunones</name> that <name type="person">Mithridates</name> had certainly merited an extreme 
and exemplary penalty, which he was not wanting in power to inflict, but it 
had been the principle of his ancestors to show as much forbearance to a 
suppliant as they showed persistence against a foe. As for triumphs, they 
were won over nations and kings hitherto unconquered.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>After this, <name type="person">Mithridates</name> was given up and brought to 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> by <name type="person">Junius Cilo</name>, the procurator of <rs type="placename">Pontus</rs>. There 
in the emperor's presence he was said to have spoken too proudly for his 
position, and words uttered by him to the following effect became the 
popular talk: "I have not been sent, but have come back to you; if you do 
not believe me, let me go and pursue me." He stood too with fearless 
countenance when he was exposed to the people's gaze near the <rs type="placename">Rostra</rs>, under 
military guard. To <name type="person">Cilo</name> and <name type="person">Aquila</name> were voted, respectively, the consular 
and pr&aelig;torian decorations.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>In 
the same consulship, <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, who was terrible in her hatred and detested 
<name type="person">Lollia</name>, for having competed with

her for the emperor's hand, 
planned an accusation, through an informer who was to tax her with having 
consulted astrologers and magicians and the image of the <name type="person">Clarian Apollo</name>, 
about the imperial marriage. Upon this, <name type="person">Claudius</name>, without hearing the 
accused, first reminded the Senate of her illustrious rank, that the sister 
of <name type="person">Lucius Volusius</name> was her mother, <name type="person">Cotta Messalinus</name> her granduncle, <name type="person">Memmius 
Regulus</name> formerly her husband (for of her marriage to <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> he 
purposely said nothing), and then added that she had mischievous designs on 
the State, and must have the means of crime taken from her. Consequently, 
her property should be confiscated, and she herself banished from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. Thus out of immense wealth only five million 
sesterces were left to the exile. <name type="person">Calpurnia</name> too, a lady of high rank, was 
ruined, simply because the emperor had praised her beauty in a casual 
remark, without any passion for her. And so <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s resentment stopped 
short of extreme vengeance. A tribune was despatched to <name type="person">Lollia</name>, who was to 
force her to suicide. Next on the prosecution of the <name type="ethnic">Bithynians</name>, <name type="person">Cadius 
Rufus</name>, was condemned under the law against extortion.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>Narbon <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, for its 
special reverence of the Senate, received a privilege. Senators belonging to 
the province, without seeking the emperor's approval, were to be allowed to 
visit their estates, a right enjoyed by <rs type="placename">Sicily</rs>. <rs type="placename">Itur&aelig;a</rs> and <rs type="placename">Jud&aelig;</rs>, on 
the death of their kings, <name type="person">Soh&aelig;mus</name> and <name type="person">Agrippa</name>, were annexed to the 
province of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. </p>
<p>It was also decided that the 
augury of the public safety, which for seventy-five years had been neglected, 
should be revived and henceforth observed. The emperor likewise widened the 
sacred precincts of the capital, in conformity with the ancient usage, 
according to which, those who had enlarged the empire were permitted also to 
extend the boundaries of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. But Roman generals, 
even after the conquest of great nations, had never exercised this right, 
except <name type="person">Lucius Sulla</name> and the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>There are various popular accounts of the ambitious and 
vainglorious efforts of our kings in this matter. Still, I think, it is 
interesting to know accurately the original plan of the precinct, as it was 
fixed by <name type="person">Romulus</name>. From the ox market, where we see the brazen statue of a 
bull, because

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CLAUDIUS ADOPTS DOMITIUS (<placeName key="tgn,2538429">NERO</placeName>)</note>
that 
animal is yoked to the plough, a furrow was drawn to mark out the town, so 
as to embrace the great altar of <name type="person">Hercules</name>; then, at regular intervals, 
stones were placed along the foot of the <rs type="placename">Palatine hill</rs> to the <rs type="placename">altar of 
Consus</rs>, soon afterwards, to the old Courts, and then to the <rs type="placename">chapel of 
Larunda</rs>. The <rs type="placename">Roman forum</rs> and the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs> were not, it was supposed, added to 
the city by <name type="person">Romulus</name>, but by <name type="person">Titus Tatius</name>. In time, the precinct was enlarged 
with the growth of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s fortunes. The boundaries now fixed by <name type="person">Claudius</name> may 
be easily recognized, as they are specified in the public records.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>In the consulship of <name type="person">Caius Antistius</name> and 
<name type="person">Marcus Suilius</name>, the adoption of <name type="person">Domitius</name> was hastened on by the influence of 
<name type="person">Pallas</name>. Bound to <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, first as the promoter of her marriage, then as 
her paramour, he still urged <name type="person">Claudius</name> to think of the interests of the 
State, and to provide some support for the tender years of <name type="person">Britannicus</name>. 
"So," he said, "it had been with the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>, whose stepsons, though 
he had grandsons to be his stay, had been promoted; <name type="person">Tiberius</name> too, though he 
had offspring of his own, had adopted <name type="person">Germanicus</name>. <name type="person">Claudius</name> also would do 
well to strengthen himself with a young prince who could share his cares 
with him." </p>
<p>Overcome by these arguments, the emperor preferred <name type="person">Domitius</name> 
to his own son, though he was but two years older, and made a speech in the 
senate, the same in substance as the representations of his freedman. It was 
noted by learned men, that no previous example of adoption into the 
patrician family of the Claudii was to be found; and that from <name type="person">Attus Clausus</name> 
there had been one unbroken line.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>However, the emperor received formal thanks, and still more elaborate 
flattery was paid to <name type="person">Domitius</name>. A law was passed, adopting him into the 
Claudian family with the name of <name type="person">Nero</name>. <name type="person">Agrippina</name> too was honoured with the 
title of <placeName key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>. When this had been done, there was not a person so void of 
pity as not to feel keen sorrow at the position of <name type="person">Britannicus</name>. Gradually 
forsaken by the very slaves who waited on him, he turned into ridicule the 
ill-timed attentions of his stepmother, perceiving their insincerity. For he 
is said to have had by no means a dull understanding; and this is either a 
fact, or perhaps his perils won him sympathy,

and so he possessed 
the credit of it, without actual evidence.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p><name type="person">Agrippina</name>, to show her power even to the allied nations, 
procured the despatch of a colony of veterans to the chief town of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name>, 
where she was born. The place was named after her. <name type="person">Agrippa</name>, her grandfather, 
had, as it happened, received this tribe, when they crossed the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, under our protection. </p>
<p>During the same time, 
there was a panic in <rs type="placename">Upper Germany</rs> through an 
irruption of plundering bands of <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>. Thereupon <name type="person">Lucius Pomponius</name>, who was 
in command, directed the <name type="ethnic">Vangiones</name> and <name type="ethnic">Nemetes</name>, with the allied cavalry, to 
anticipate the raid, and suddenly to fall upon them from every quarter while 
they were dispersed. The general's plan was backed up by the energy of the 
troops. These were divided into two columns; and those who marched to the 
left cut off the plunderers, just on their return, after a riotous enjoyment 
of their spoil, when they were heavy with sleep. It added to the men's joy 
that they had rescued from slavery after forty years some survivors of the 
defeat of <name type="person">Varus</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>The column which 
took the right-hand and the shorter route, inflicted greater loss on the 
enemy who met them, and ventured on a battle. With much spoil and glory they 
returned to <rs type="placename">Mount Taunus</rs>, where <name type="person">Pomponius</name> was 
waiting with the legions, to see whether the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>, in their eagerness for 
vengeance, would give him a chance of fighting. They however fearing to be 
hemmed in on one side by the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, on the other by the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, with whom 
they are perpetually at feud, sent envoys and hostages to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. To <name type="person">Pomponius</name> was decreed the honour of a triumph; 
a mere fraction of his renown with the next generation, with whom his poems 
constitute his chief glory.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>At this 
same time, <name type="person">Vannius</name>, whom <name type="person">Drusus C&aelig;sar</name> had made king of the <name type="ethnic">Suevi</name>, was 
driven from his kingdom. In the commencement of his reign he was renowned 
and popular with his countrymen; but subsequently, with long possession, he 
became a tyrant, and the enmity of neighbours joined to intestine strife, 
was his ruin. <name type="person">Vibillius</name>, king of the <name type="ethnic">Hermunduri</name>, and <name type="person">Vangio</name> and <name type="person">Sido</name>, sons 
of a sister of <name type="person">Vannius</name>, led the movement. <name type="person">Claudius</name>, though often entreated, 
declined to interpose by arms in the conflict of the barbar-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SUEVIAN PUPPET DETHRONED</note>
ians, and simply promised 
<name type="person">Vannius</name> a safe refuge in the event of his expulsion. He wrote instructions 
to <name type="person">Publius Atellius Hister</name>, governor of <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs>, 
that he was to have his legions, with some picked auxiliaries from the 
province itself, encamped on the river-bank, as a support to the conquered 
and a terror to the conqueror, who might otherwise, in the elation of 
success, disturb also the peace of our empire. For an immense host of <name type="ethnic">Ligii</name>, 
with other tribes, was advancing, attracted by the fame of the opulent realm 
which <name type="person">Vannius</name> had enriched during thirty years of plunder and of tribute. 
<name type="person">Vannius</name>'s own native force was infantry, and his cavalry was from the 
<name type="ethnic">Iazyges</name> of <rs type="placename">Sarmatia</rs>; an army which was no match for 
his numerous enemy. Consequently, he determined to maintain himself in 
fortified positions, and protract the war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>But the <name type="ethnic">Iazyges</name>, who could not endure a siege, dispersed 
themselves throughout the surrounding country and rendered an engagement 
inevitable, as the <name type="ethnic">Ligii</name> and <name type="ethnic">Hermunduri</name> had there rushed to the attack. So 
<name type="person">Vannius</name> came down out of his fortresses, and though he was defeated in 
battle, notwithstanding his reverse, he won some credit by having fought 
with his own hand, and received wounds on his breast. He then fled to the 
fleet which was awaiting him on the <rs type="placename">Danube</rs>, and was 
soon followed by his adherents, who received grants of land and were settled 
in <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs>. <name type="person">Vangio</name> and <name type="person">Sido</name> divided his kingdom 
between them; they were admirably loyal to us, and among their subjects, 
whether the cause was in themselves or in the nature of despotism, much 
loved, while seeking to acquire power, and yet more hated when they had 
acquired it.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>Meanwhile, in <rs type="placename">Britain</rs>, <name type="person">Publius Ostorius</name>, the pro-pr&aelig;tor, found 
himself confronted by disturbance. The enemy had burst into the territories 
of our allies with all the more fury, as they imagined that a new general 
would not march against them with winter beginning and with an army of which 
he knew nothing. <name type="person">Ostorius</name>, well aware that first events are those which 
produce alarm or confidence, by a rapid movement of his light cohorts, cut 
down all who opposed him, pursued those who fled, and lest they should 
rally, and so an unquiet and treacherous peace might allow no rest to the 
general and his troops, he prepared to disarm all whom

he 
suspected, and to occupy with encampments the whole country to the <rs type="placename">Avon</rs> and <rs type="placename">Severn</rs>. The <name type="ethnic">Iceni</name>, a 
powerful tribe, which war had not weakened, as they had voluntarily joined 
our alliance, were the first to resist. At their instigation the surrounding 
nations chose as a battlefield a spot walled in by a rude barrier, with a 
narrow approach, impenetrable to cavalry. Through these defences the Roman 
general, though he had with him only the allied troops, without the strength 
of the legions, attempted to break, and having assigned their positions to 
his cohorts, he equipped even his cavalry for the work of infantry. Then at 
a given signal they forced the barrier, routing the enemy who were entangled 
in their own defences. The rebels, conscious of their guilt, and finding 
escape barred, performed many noble feats. In this battle, <name type="person">Marius Ostorius</name>, 
the general's son, won the reward for saving a citizen's life.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>The defeat of the <name type="ethnic">Iceni</name> quieted those who were 
hesitating between war and peace. Then the army was marched against the 
<name type="ethnic">Cangi</name>; their territory was ravaged, spoil taken everywhere without the enemy 
venturing on an engagement, or if they attempted to harass our march by 
stealthy attacks, their cunning was always punished. And now <name type="person">Ostorius</name> had 
advanced within a little distance of the sea, facing the island <rs type="placename">Hibernia</rs>, when feuds broke out among the <name type="ethnic">Brigantes</name> and 
compelled the general's return, for it was his fixed purpose not to 
undertake any fresh enterprise till he had consolidated his previous 
successes. The <name type="ethnic">Brigantes</name> indeed, when a few who were beginning hostilities 
had been slain and the rest pardoned, settled down quietly; but on the 
<name type="ethnic">Silures</name> neither terror nor mercy had the least effect; they persisted in war 
and could be quelled only by legions encamped in their country. That this 
might be the more promptly effected, a colony of a strong body of veterans 
was established at <rs type="placename">Camulodunum</rs> on the conquered 
lands, as a defence against the rebels, and as a means of imbuing the allies 
with respect for our laws.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>The army 
then marched against the <name type="ethnic">Silures</name>, a naturally fierce people and now full of 
confidence in the might of <name type="person">Caractacus</name>, who by many an indecisive and many a 
successful battle had raised himself far above all the other generals

 <note place="marg" anchored="yes">INSURRECTION IN <rs type="placename">BRITAIN</rs></note>
of the 
<name type="ethnic">Britons</name>. Inferior in military strength, but deriving an advantage from the 
deceptiveness of the country, he at once shifted the war by a stratagem into 
the territory of the <name type="ethnic">Ordovices</name>, where, joined by all who dreaded peace with 
us, he resolved on a final struggle. He selected a position for the 
engagement in which advance and retreat alike would be difficult for our men 
and comparatively easy for his own, and then on some lofty hills, wherever 
their sides could be approached by a gentle slope, he piled up stones to 
serve as a rampart. A river too of varying depth was in his front, and his 
armed bands were drawn up before his defences.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>Then too the chieftains of the several tribes went from rank to 
rank, encouraging and confirming the spirit of their men by making light of 
their fears, kindling their hopes, and by every other warlike incitement. As 
for <name type="person">Caractacus</name>, he flew hither and thither, protesting that that day and 
that battle would be the beginning of the recovery of their freedom, or of 
everlasting bondage. He appealed, by name, to their forefathers who had 
driven back the dictator <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, by whose valour they were free from 
the Roman axe and tribute, and still preserved inviolate the persons of 
their wives and of their children. While he was thus speaking, the host 
shouted applause; every warrior bound himself by his national oath not to 
shrink from weapons or wounds.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>Such 
enthusiasm confounded the Roman general. The river too in his face, the 
rampart they had added to it, the frowning hilltops, the stern resistance 
and masses of fighting men everywhere apparent, daunted him. But his 
soldiers insisted on battle, exclaiming that valour could overcome all 
things; and the prefects and tribunes, with similar language, stimulated the 
ardour of the troops. <name type="person">Ostorius</name> having ascertained by a survey the 
inaccessible and the assailable points of the position, led on his furious 
men, and crossed the river without difficulty. When he reached the barrier, 
as long as it was a fight with missiles, the wounds and the slaughter fell 
chiefly on our soldiers; but when we had formed the military testudo, and 
the rude, ill-compacted fence of stones was torn down, and it was an equal 
hand-to-hand engagement, the barbarians retired to the heights. Yet even 
there, both light and heavy-armed soldiers rushed to the attack; the first 
har-

assed the foe with missiles, while the latter closed with 
them, and the opposing ranks of the <name type="ethnic">Britons</name> were broken, destitute as they 
were of the defence of breast-plates or helmets. When they faced the 
auxiliaries, they were felled by the swords and javelins of our legionaries; 
if they wheeled round, they were again met by the sabres and spears of the 
auxiliaries. It was a glorious victory; the wife and daughter of <name type="person">Caractacus</name> 
were captured, and his brothers too were admitted to surrender.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>There is seldom safety for the unfortunate, 
and <name type="person">Caractacus</name>, seeking the protection of <name type="person">Cartismandua</name>, queen of the 
<name type="ethnic">Brigantes</name>, was put in chains and delivered up to the conquerors, nine years 
after the beginning of the war in <rs type="placename">Britain</rs>. His fame 
had spread thence, and travelled to the neighbouring islands and provinces, 
and was actually celebrated in <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. All were eager 
to see the great man, who for so many years had defied our power. Even at 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> the name of <name type="person">Caractacus</name> was no obscure one; and 
the emperor, while he exalted his own glory, enhanced the renown of the 
vanquished. The people were summoned as to a grand spectacle; the 
pr&aelig;torian cohorts were drawn up under arms in the plain in front of 
their camp; then came a procession of the royal vassals, and the ornaments 
and neck-chains and the spoils which the king had won in wars with other 
tribes, were displayed. Next were to be seen his brothers, his wife and 
daughter; last of all, <name type="person">Caractacus</name> himself. All the rest stooped in their 
fear to abject supplication; not so the king, who neither by humble look nor 
speech sought compassion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>When he was 
set before the emperor's tribunal, he spoke as follows: "Had my moderation 
in prosperity been equal to my noble birth and fortune, I should have 
entered this city as your friend rather than as your captive; and you would 
not have disdained to receive, under a treaty of peace, a king descended 
from illustrious ancestors and ruling many nations. My present lot is as 
glorious to you as it is degrading to myself. I had men and horses, arms and 
wealth. What wonder if I parted with them reluctantly? If you <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> choose 
to lord it over the world, does it follow that the world is to accept 
slavery? Were I to have been at once delivered up as a prisoner, neither my 
fall nor your triumph

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">BRITISH CHIEFTAIN CAPTIVE IN <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note>
would have become famous. My punishment 
would be followed by oblivion, whereas, if you save my life, I shall be an 
everlasting memorial of your clemency." </p>
<p>Upon this the emperor granted 
pardon to <name type="person">Caractacus</name>, to his wife, and to his brothers. Released from their 
bonds, they did homage also to <name type="person">Agrippina</name> who sat near, conspicuous on 
another throne, in the same language of praise and gratitude. It was indeed 
a novelty, quite alien to ancient manners, for a woman to sit in front of 
Roman standards. In fact, <name type="person">Agrippina</name> boasted that she was herself a partner 
in the empire which her ancestors had won.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>The Senate was then assembled, and speeches were delivered full 
of pompous eulogy on the capture of <name type="person">Caractacus</name>. It was as glorious, they 
said, as the display of <name type="person">Syphax</name> by <name type="person">Scipio</name>, or of <name type="person">Perses</name> by <name type="person">Lucius Paulus</name>, or 
indeed of any captive prince by any of our generals to the people of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Triumphal distinctions were voted to <name type="person">Ostorius</name>, who 
thus far had been successful, but soon afterwards met with reverses; either 
because, when <name type="person">Caractacus</name> was out of the way, our discipline was relaxed 
under an impression that the war was ended, or because the enemy, out of 
compassion for so great a king, was more ardent in his thirst for vengeance. 
Instantly they rushed from all parts on the camp-prefect, and legionary 
cohorts left to establish fortified positions among the <name type="ethnic">Silures</name>, and had not 
speedy succour arrived from towns and fortresses in the neighbourhood, our 
forces would then have been totally destroyed. Even as it was, the 
camp-prefect, with eight centurions, and the bravest of the soldiers, were 
slain; and shortly afterwards, a foraging party of our men, with some 
cavalry squadrons sent to their support, was utterly routed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p><name type="person">Ostorius</name> then deployed his light cohorts, but even 
thus he did not stop the flight, till our legions sustained the brunt of the 
battle. Their strength equalized the conflict, which after a while was in 
our favour. The enemy fled with trifling loss, as the day was on the 
decline. Now began a series of skirmishes, for the most part like raids, in 
woods and morasses, with encounters due to chance or to courage, to mere 
heedlessness or to calculation, to fury or to lust of plunder, under 
directions from the officers, or sometimes even

without their 
knowledge. Conspicuous above all in stubborn resistance were the <name type="ethnic">Silures</name>, 
whose rage was fired by words rumoured to have been spoken by the Roman 
general, to the effect, that as the <name type="ethnic">Sugambri</name> had been formerly destroyed or 
transplanted into <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, so the name of the <name type="ethnic">Silures</name> 
ought to be blotted out. Accordingly they cut off two of our auxiliary 
cohorts, the rapacity of whose officers let them make incautious forays; and 
by liberal gifts of spoil and prisoners to the other tribes, they were 
luring them too into revolt, when <name type="person">Ostorius</name>, worn out by the burden of his 
anxieties, died, to the joy of the enemy, who thought that a campaign at 
least, though not a single battle, had proved fatal to a general whom none 
could despise.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>The emperor on hearing 
of the death of his representative appointed <name type="person">Aulus Didius</name> in his place, that 
the province might not be left without a governor. <name type="person">Didius</name>, though he quickly 
arrived, found matters far from prosperous, for the legion under the command 
of <name type="person">Manlius Valens</name> had meanwhile been defeated, and the disaster had been 
exaggerated by the enemy to alarm the new general, while he again magnified 
it, that he might win the more glory by quelling the movement or have a 
fairer excuse if it lasted. This loss too had been inflicted on us by the 
<name type="ethnic">Silures</name>, and they were scouring the country far and wide, till <name type="person">Didius</name> 
hurried up and dispersed them. After the capture of <name type="person">Caractacus</name>, <name type="person">Venutius</name> of 
the <name type="ethnic">Brigantes</name>, as I have already mentioned, was preeminent in military 
skill; he had long been loyal to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and had been 
defended by our arms while he was united in marriage to the queen 
<name type="person">Cartismandua</name>. Subsequently a quarrel broke out between them, followed 
instantly by war, and he then assumed a hostile attitude also towards us. At 
first, however, they simply fought against each other, and <name type="person">Cartismandua</name> by 
cunning stratagems captured the brothers and kinsfolk of <name type="person">Venutius</name>. This 
enraged the enemy, who were stung with shame at the prospect of falling 
under the dominion of a woman. The flower of their youth, picked out for 
war, invaded her kingdom. This we had foreseen; some cohorts were sent to 
her aid and a sharp contest followed, which was at first doubtful but had a 
satisfactory termination.

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">BRITISH RESISTANCE 
CONTINUES</note>
 </p><p>The legion under the command of <name type="person">C&aelig;sius Nasica</name> 
fought with a similar result. For <name type="person">Didius</name>, burdened with years and covered 
with honours, was content with acting through his officers and merely 
holding back the enemy. These transactions, though occurring under two 
propr&aelig;tors, and occupying several years, I have closely connected, 
lest, if related separately, they might be less easily remembered. I now 
return to the chronological order.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>In 
the fifth consulship of <name type="person">Tiberius Claudius</name> with <name type="person">Sextius Cornelius Orfitus</name> for 
his colleague, <name type="person">Nero</name> was prematurely invested with the dress of manhood, that 
he might be thought qualified for political life. The emperor willingly 
complied with the flatteries of the Senate who wished <name type="person">Nero</name> to enter on the 
consulship in his twentieth year, and meanwhile, as consul-elect, to have 
proconsular authority beyond the limits of the capital with the title of 
"prince of the youth of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>." A donative was also 
given to the soldiery in <name type="person">Nero</name>'s name, and presents to the city populace. At 
the games too of the circus which were then being celebrated to win for him 
popular favour, <name type="person">Britannicus</name> wore the dress of boyhood, <name type="person">Nero</name> the triumphal 
robe, as they rode in the procession. The people would thus behold the one 
with the decorations of a general, the other in a boy's habit, and would 
accordingly anticipate their respective destinies. At the same time those of 
the centurions and tribunes who pitied the lot of <name type="person">Britannicus</name> were removed, 
some on false pretexts, others by way of a seeming compliment. Even of the 
freedmen, all who were of incorruptible fidelity were discarded on the 
following provocation. Once when they met, <name type="person">Nero</name> greeted <name type="person">Britannicus</name> by that 
name and was greeted in return as <name type="person">Domitius</name>. <name type="person">Agrippina</name> reported this to her 
husband, with bitter complaint, as the beginning of a quarrel, as implying, 
in fact, contempt of <name type="person">Nero</name>'s adoption and a cancelling at home of the 
Senate's decree and the people's vote. She said, too, that, if the 
perversity of such malignant suggestions were not checked, it would issue in 
the ruin of the State. <name type="person">Claudius</name>, enraged by what he took as a grave charge, 
punished with banishment or death all his son's best instructors, and set 
persons appointed by his stepmother to have the care of him.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>Still <name type="person">Agrippina</name> did not yet dare to 
attempt her greatest scheme, unless <name type="person">Lusius Geta</name> and <name type="person">Rufius Crispinus</name> were 
removed from the command of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts; for she thought 
that they cherished <name type="person">Messalina</name>'s memory and were devoted to her children. 
Accordingly, as the emperor's wife persistently affirmed that faction was 
rife among these cohorts through the rivalry of the two officers, and that 
there would be stricter discipline under one commander, the appointment was 
transferred to <name type="person">Burrus Afranius</name>, who had a brilliant reputation as a soldier, 
but knew well to whose wish he owed his promotion. <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, too, continued 
to exalt her own dignity; she would enter the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs> in a chariot, a 
practice, which being allowed of old only to the priests and sacred images, 
increased the popular reverence for a woman who up to this time was the only 
recorded instance of one who, an emperor's daughter, was sister, wife, and 
mother of a sovereign. Meanwhile her foremost champion, <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, in the 
full tide of his power and in extreme age (so uncertain are the fortunes of 
the great) was attacked by an accusation of which <name type="person">Junius Lupus</name>, a senator, 
was the author. He was charged with treason and designs on the throne. The 
emperor would have lent a ready ear, had not <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, by threats rather 
than entreaties, induced him to sentence the accuser to outlawry. This was 
all that <name type="person">Vitellius</name> desired.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>Several 
prodigies occurred in that year. Birds of evil omen perched on the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs>; 
houses were thrown down by frequent shocks of earthquake, and as the panic 
spread, all the weak were trodden down in the hurry and confusion of the 
crowd. Scanty crops too, and consequent famine were regarded as a token of 
calamity. Nor were there merely whispered complaints; while <name type="person">Claudius</name> was 
administering justice, the populace crowded round him with a boisterous 
clamour and drove him to a corner of the forum, where they violently pressed 
on him till he broke through the furious mob with a body of soldiers. It was 
ascertained that <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> had provisions for no more 
than fifteen days, and it was through the signal bounty of heaven and the 
mildness of the winter that its desperate plight was relieved. And yet in 
past days <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> used to send supplies for the 
legions into

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AGRIPPINA'S PRIDE; PARTHIAN BREAK</note>
distant provinces, and even now it is not a barren soil which 
causes distress. But we prefer to cultivate <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> 
and <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs>, and trust the life of the Roman people to 
ships and all their risks.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>In the 
same year war broke out between the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name>, and was the 
cause of very serious disturbances between <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> 
and <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <name type="person">Vologeses</name> was king of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>; on 
the mother's side, he was the offspring of a Greek concubine, and he 
obtained the throne by the retirement of his brothers. <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> had been 
long in possession of <rs type="placename">Iberia</rs>, and his brother, 
<name type="person">Mithridates</name>, ruled <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> with our powerful 
support. There was a son of <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> named <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name>, tall and 
handsome, of singular bodily strength, trained in all the accomplishments of 
his countrymen and highly renowned among his neighbours. He boasted so 
arrogantly and persistently that his father's prolonged old age kept back 
from him the little kingdom of <rs type="placename">Iberia</rs> as to make no 
concealment of his ambition. <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> accordingly seeing the young prince 
had power in his grasp and was strong in the attachment of his people, 
fearing too his own declining years, tempted him with other prospects and 
pointed to <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, which, as he reminded him, he 
had given to <name type="person">Mithridates</name> after driving out the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>. But open violence, 
he said, must be deferred; artful measures, which might crush him unawares, 
were better. So <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> pretended to be at feud with his father as 
though his stepmother's hatred was too strong for him, and went to his 
uncle. While he was treated by him like a son, with excessive kindness, he 
lured the nobles of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> into revolutionary 
schemes, without the knowledge of <name type="person">Mithridates</name>, who was actually loading him 
with honours.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>He then assumed a show 
of reconciliation with his father, to whom he returned, telling him all that 
could be accomplished by treachery was now ready and that he must complete 
the affair by the sword. Meanwhile <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> invented pretexts for war; 
when he was fighting with the king of the <name type="ethnic">Albanians</name> and appealing to the 
<name type="ethnic">Romans</name> for aid, his brother, he said, had opposed him, and he would now 
avenge that wrong by his destruction. At the same time he gave a large army 
to his son, who by a sudden invasion

drove <name type="person">Mithridates</name> in terror 
from the open country and forced him into the <rs type="placename">fortress of Gorneas</rs>, which was 
strongly situated and garrisoned by some soldiers under the command of 
<name type="person">C&aelig;lius Pollio</name>, a camp-prefect, and <name type="person">Casperius</name>, a centurion. </p>
<p>There 
is nothing of which barbarians are so ignorant as military engines and the 
skilful management of sieges, while that is a branch of military science 
which we especially understand. And so <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> having attempted the 
fortified walls in vain or with loss, began a blockade, and, finding that 
his assaults were despised, tried to bribe the rapacity of the camp-prefect. 
<name type="person">Casperius</name> protested earnestly against the overthrow of an allied king and of 
<rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, the gift of the Roman people, through 
iniquity and greed of gain. At last, as <name type="person">Pollio</name> pleaded the overpowering 
numbers of the enemy and <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> the orders of his father, the centurion 
stipulated for a truce and retired, intending, if he could not deter 
<name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> from further hostilities, to inform <name type="person">Ummidius Quadratus</name>, the 
governor of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, of the state of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>By the 
centurion's departure the camp-prefect was released, so to say, from 
surveillance; and he now urged <name type="person">Mithridates</name> to conclude a treaty. He reminded 
him of the tie of brotherhood, of the seniority in age of <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, and 
of their other bonds of kindred, how he was united by marriage to his 
brother's daughter, and was himself the father-in-law of <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name>. "The 
<name type="ethnic">Iberians</name>," he said, "were not against peace, though for the moment they were 
the stronger; the perfidy of the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> was notorious, and he had nothing 
to fall back on but a fortress without stores; so he must not hesitate to 
prefer a bloodless negotiation to arms." As <name type="person">Mithridates</name> wavered, and 
suspected the intentions of the camp-prefect, because he had seduced one of 
the king's concubines and was reputed a man who could be bribed into any 
wickedness, <name type="person">Casperius</name> meantime went to <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> and required of him that 
the <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> should raise the blockade. <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, to his face, replied 
vaguely and often in a conciliatory tone, while by secret messages he 
recommended <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> to hurry on the siege by all possible means. Then 
the price of infamy was raised, and <name type="person">Pollio</name> by secret corruption induced the 
soldiers to demand peace and to

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">RISE OF 
RHADAMISTUS</note>
threaten that they would abandon the garrison. Under this 
compulsion, <name type="person">Mithridates</name> agreed to a day and a place for negotiation and 
quitted the fortress.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p><name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> at 
first threw himself into his embraces, feigning respect and calling him 
father-in-law and parent. He swore an oath too that he would do him no 
violence either by the sword or by poison. At the same time he drew him into 
a neighbouring grove, where he assured him that the appointed sacrifice was 
prepared for the confirmation of peace in the presence of the gods. It is a 
custom of these princes, whenever they join alliance, to unite their right 
hands and bind together the thumbs in a tight knot; then, when the blood has 
flowed into the extremities, they let it escape by a slight puncture and 
suck it in turn. Such a treaty is thought to have a mysterious sanctity, as 
being sealed with the blood of both parties. On this occasion he who was 
applying the knot pretended that it had fallen off, and suddenly seizing the 
knees of <name type="person">Mithridates</name> flung him to the ground. At the same moment a rush was 
made by a number of persons, and chains were thrown round him. Then he was 
dragged along by a fetter, an extreme degradation to a barbarian; and soon 
the common people, whom he had held under a harsh sway, heaped insults on 
him with menacing gestures, though some, on the contrary, pitied such a 
reverse of fortune. His wife followed him with his little children, and 
filled every place with her wailings. They were hidden away in different 
covered carriages till the orders of <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name> were distinctly 
ascertained. The lust of rule was more to him than his brother and his 
daughter, and his heart was steeled to any wickedness. Still he spared his 
eyes the seeing them slain before his face. <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> too, seemingly 
mindful of his oath, neither unsheathed the sword nor used poison against 
his sister and uncle, but had them thrown on the ground and then smothered 
them under a mass of heavy clothes. Even the sons of <name type="person">Mithridates</name> were 
butchered for having shed tears over their parent's murder.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p><name type="person">Quadratus</name>, learning that <name type="person">Mithridates</name> had been 
betrayed and that his kingdom was in the hands of his murderers, summoned a 
council, and, having informed them of what had occurred, consulted them 
whether he should take

vengeance. Few cared for the honour of the 
State; most argued in favour of a safe course, saying "that any crime in a 
foreign country was to be welcomed with joy, and that the seeds of strife 
ought to be actually sown, on the very principle on which Roman emperors had 
often under a show of generosity given away this same kingdom of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> to excite the minds of the barbarians. 
<name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> might retain his ill-gotten gains, as long as he was hated and 
infamous; for this was more to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s interest than for him to have 
succeeded with glory." To this view they assented, but that they might not 
be thought to have approved the crime and receive contrary orders from the 
emperor, envoys were sent to <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, requiring him to withdraw from 
Armenian territory and remove his son.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p><name type="person">Julius Pelignus</name> was then procurator of <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs>, a man despised alike for his feebleness of 
mind and his grotesque personal appearance. He was however very intimate 
with <name type="person">Claudius</name>, who, when in private life, used to beguile the dullness of 
his leisure with the society of jesters. This <name type="person">Pelignus</name> collected some 
provincial auxiliaries, apparently with the design of recovering <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, but, while he plundered allies instead of 
enemies, finding himself, through the desertion of his men and the raids of 
the barbarians, utterly defenceless, he went to <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name>, whose gifts so 
completely overcame him that he positively encouraged him to assume the 
ensigns of royalty, and himself assisted at the ceremony, authorizing and 
abetting. When the disgraceful news had spread far and wide, lest the world 
might judge of other governors by <name type="person">Pelignus</name>, <name type="person">Helvidius Priscus</name> was sent in 
command of a legion to regulate, according to circumstances, the disordered 
state of affairs. He quickly crossed <rs type="placename">Mount Taurus,</rs> 
and had restored order to a great extent more by moderation than by force, 
when he was ordered to return to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, that nothing 
might arise to provoke a war with <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>For <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, thinking that an opportunity 
presented itself of invading <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, which, though 
the possession of his ancestors, was now through a monstrous crime held by a 
foreign prince, raised an army and prepared to establish <name type="person">Tiridates</name> on the 
throne, so that not a member of his house

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PARTHIANS INVADE 
<rs type="placename">ARMENIA</rs></note>
might be without kingly power. On the 
advance of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, the <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> dispersed without a battle, and the 
Armenian cities, <rs type="placename">Artaxata</rs> and <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs>, submitted to the yoke. Then a frightful 
winter or deficient supplies, with pestilence arising from both causes, 
forced <name type="person">Vologeses</name> to abandon his present plans. <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> was thus again without a king, and was invaded 
by <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name>, who was now fiercer than ever, looking on the people as 
disloyal and sure to rebel on the first opportunity. They however, though 
accustomed to be slaves, suddenly threw off their tameness and gathered 
round the palace in arms.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p><name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> 
had no means of escape but in the swiftness of the horses which bore him and 
his wife away. Pregnant as she was, she endured, somehow or other, out of 
fear of the enemy and love of her husband, the first part of the flight, but 
after a while, when she felt herself shaken by its continuous speed, she 
implored to be rescued by an honourable death from the shame of captivity. 
He at first embraced, cheered, and encouraged her, now admiring her heroism, 
now filled with a sickening apprehension at the idea of her being left to 
any man's mercy. Finally, urged by the intensity of his love and familiarity 
with dreadful deeds, he unsheathed his scymitar, and having stabbed her, 
dragged her to the bank of the <rs type="placename">Araxes</rs> and committed 
her to the stream, so that her very body might be swept away. Then in 
headlong flight he hurried to <rs type="placename">Iberia</rs>, his ancestral 
kingdom. <name type="person">Zenobia</name> meanwhile (this was her name), as she yet breathed and 
showed signs of life on the calm water at the river's edge, was perceived by 
some shepherds, who inferring from her noble appearance that she was no 
base-born woman, bound up her wound and applied to it their rustic remedies. 
As soon as they knew her name and her adventure, they conveyed her to the 
city of <rs type="placename">Artaxata</rs>, whence she was conducted at the 
public charge to <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, who received her kindly and treated her as a 
royal person.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>In the consulship of 
<name type="person">Faustus Sulla</name> and <name type="person">Salvius Otho</name>, <name type="person">Furius Scribonianus</name> was banished on the 
ground that he was consulting the astrologers about the emperor's death. His 
mother, <name type="person">Junia</name>, was included in the accusation, as one who still resented the 
misfortune of exile which she had suffered

in the past. His 
father, <name type="person">Camillus</name>, had raised an armed insurrection in <rs type="placename">Dalmatia</rs>, and the emperor in again sparing a hostile 
family sought the credit of clemency. But the exile did not live long after 
this; whether he was cut off by a natural death, or by poison, was matter of 
conflicting rumours, according to people's belief. </p>
<p>A decree of the 
Senate was then passed for the expulsion of the astrologers from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, stringent but ineffectual. Next the emperor, in a 
speech, commended all who, from their limited means, voluntarily retired 
from the Senatorian order, while those were degraded from it who, by 
retaining their seats, added effrontery to poverty.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>During these proceedings he proposed to the Senate 
a penalty on women who united themselves in marriage to slaves, and it was 
decided that those who had thus demeaned themselves, without the knowledge 
of the slave's master, should be reduced to slavery; if with his consent, 
should be ranked as freedwomen. To <name type="person">Pallas</name>, who, as the emperor declared, was 
the author of this proposal, were offered on the motion of <name type="person">Barea Soranus</name>, 
consul-elect, the decorations of the pr&aelig;torship and fifteen million 
sesterces. <name type="person">Cornelius Scipio</name> added that he deserved public thanks for 
thinking less of his ancient nobility as a descendant from the kings of <rs type="placename">Arcadia</rs>, than of the welfare of the State, and allowing 
himself to be numbered among the emperor's ministers. <name type="person">Claudius</name> assured them 
that <name type="person">Pallas</name> was content with the honour, and that he limited himself to his 
former poverty. A decree of the Senate was publicly inscribed on a bronze 
tablet, heaping the praises of primitive frugality on a freedman, the 
possessor of three hundred million sesterces.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>Not equally moderate was his brother, surnamed <name type="person">Felix</name>, who had 
for some time been governor of <rs type="placename">Jud&aelig;a</rs>, and 
thought that he could do any evil act with impunity, backed up as he was by 
such power. It is true that the <name type="ethnic">Jews</name> had shown symptoms of commotion in a 
seditious outbreak, and when they had heard of the assassination of <name type="person">Caius</name>, 
there was no hearty submission, as a fear still lingered that any of the 
emperors might impose the same orders. <name type="person">Felix</name> meanwhile, by ill-timed 
remedies, stimulated disloyal acts; while he had, as a rival in the worst 
wickedness, <name type="person">Ventidius Cumanus</name>,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">DISTURBANCES IN <rs type="placename">JUD&AElig;A</rs> AND <rs type="placename">CILICIA</rs></note>
who held a part of the province, 
which was so divided that <rs type="placename">Galilea</rs> was governed by 
<name type="person">Cumanus</name>, <rs type="placename">Samaria</rs> by <name type="person">Felix</name>. The two peoples had long 
been at feud, and now less than ever restrained their enmity, from contempt 
of their rulers. And accordingly they plundered each other, letting loose 
bands of robbers, forming ambuscades, and occasionally fighting battles, and 
carrying the spoil and booty to the two procurators, who at first rejoiced 
at all this, but, as the mischief grew, they interposed with an armed force, 
which was cut to pieces. The flame of war would have spread through the 
province, but it was saved by <name type="person">Quadratus</name>, governor of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>. In dealing with the <name type="ethnic">Jews</name>, who had been daring 
enough to slay our soldiers, there was little hesitation about their being 
capitally punished. Some delay indeed was occasioned by <name type="person">Cumanus</name> and <name type="person">Felix</name>; 
for <name type="person">Claudius</name> on hearing the causes of the rebellion had given authority for 
deciding also the case of these procurators. <name type="person">Quadratus</name>, however, exhibited 
<name type="person">Felix</name> as one of the judges, admitting him to the bench with the view of 
cowing the ardour of the prosecutors. And so <name type="person">Cumanus</name> was condemned for the 
crimes which the two had committed, and tranquillity was restored to the 
province.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>Not long afterwards some 
tribes of the wild population of <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>, known as 
the <name type="ethnic">Clitae</name>, which had often been in commotion, established a camp, under a 
leader <name type="person">Troxobor</name>, on their rocky mountains, whence rushing down on the coast, 
and on the towns, they dared to do violence to the farmers and townsfolk, 
frequently even to the merchants and ship-owners. They besieged the city <rs type="placename">Anemurium</rs>, and routed some troopers sent from <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> to its rescue under the command of <name type="person">Curtius 
Severus</name>; for the rough country in the neighbourhood, suited as it is for the 
fighting of infantry, did not allow of cavalry operations. After a time, 
<name type="person">Antiochus</name>, king of that coast, having broken the unity of the barbarian 
forces, by cajolery of the people and treachery to their leader, slew 
<name type="person">Troxobor</name> and a few chiefs, and pacified the rest by gentle measures.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p>About the same time, the mountain between 
<rs type="placename">Lake Fucinus</rs> and the river <rs type="placename">Liris</rs> was bored through, and that this grand work might 
be seen by a multitude of visitors, preparations were made for a naval 
battle on the lake, just

as formerly <name type="person">Augustus</name> exhibited such a 
spectacle, in a basin he had made on this side the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, though with light vessels, and on a smaller 
scale. <name type="person">Claudius</name> equipped galleys with three and four banks of oars, and 
nineteen thousand men; he lined the circumference of the lake with rafts, 
that there might be no means of escape at various points, but he still left 
full space for the strength of the crews, the skill of the pilots, the 
impact of the vessels, and the usual operations of a sea-fight. On the raft 
stood companies of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts and cavalry, with a 
breastwork in front of them, from which catapults and balistas might be 
worked. The rest of the lake was occupied by marines on decked vessels. An 
immense multitude from the neighbouring towns, others from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> itself, eager to see the sight or to show respect 
to the emperor, crowded the banks, the hills, and mountain tops, which thus 
resembled a theatre. The emperor, with <name type="person">Agrippina</name> seated near him, presided; 
he wore a splendid military cloak, she, a mantle of cloth of gold. A battle 
was fought with all the courage of brave men, though it was between 
condemned criminals. After much bloodshed they were released from the 
necessity of mutual slaughter.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>When 
the sight was over, the outlet of the water was opened. The careless 
execution of the work was apparent, the tunnel not having been bored down so 
low as the bottom, or middle of the lake. Consequently after an interval the 
excavations were deepened, and to attract a crowd once more, a show of 
gladiators was exhibited, with floating pontoons for an infantry engagement. 
A banquet too was prepared close to the outflow of the lake, and it was the 
means of greatly alarming the whole company, for the water, in the violence 
of its outburst, swept away the adjoining parts, shook the more remote, and 
spread terror with the tremendous crash. At the same time, <name type="person">Agrippina</name> availed 
herself of the emperor's fright to charge <name type="person">Narcissus</name>, who had been the agent 
of the work, with avarice and peculation. He too was not silent, but 
inveighed against the domineering temper of her sex, and her extravagant 
ambition.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>In the consulship of <name type="person">Didius 
Junius</name> and <name type="person">Quintus Haterius</name>, <name type="person">Nero</name>, now sixteen years of age, married 
<name type="person">Octavia</name>, the emperor's daughter. Anxious to distinguish himself by noble

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PANIC AT NAVAL SHOW</note>
pursuits and the reputation of an 
orator, he advocated the cause of the people of <rs type="placename">Ilium</rs>, and having eloquently recounted how <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> was the offspring of <rs type="placename">Troy</rs>, 
and <name type="person">&AElig;neas</name> the founder of the <placeName key="tgn,2075295">Julian</placeName> line, with other old traditions 
akin to myths, he gained for his clients exemption from all public burdens. 
His pleading too procured for the colony of <rs type="placename">Bononia</rs>, 
which had been ruined by a fire, a subvention of ten million sesterces. The 
<name type="ethnic">Rhodians</name> also had their freedom restored to them, which had often been taken 
away, or confirmed, according to their services to us in our foreign wars, 
or their seditious misdeeds at home. <rs type="placename">Apamea</rs>, too, 
which had been shaken by an earthquake, had its tribute remitted for five 
years.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p><name type="person">Claudius</name>, on the other hand, 
was being prompted to exhibit the worst cruelty by the artifices of the same 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>. On the accusation of <name type="person">Tarquitius Priscus</name>, she ruined <name type="person">Statilius 
Taurus</name>, who was famous for his wealth, and at whose gardens she cast a 
greedy eye. <name type="person">Priscus</name> had served under <name type="person">Taurus</name> in his proconsular government of 
<rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, and after their return charged him with a 
few acts of extortion, but particularly with magical and superstitious 
practices. <name type="person">Taurus</name>, no longer able to endure a false accusation and an 
undeserved humiliation, put a violent end to his life before the Senate's 
decision was pronounced. <name type="person">Tarquitius</name> was however expelled from the Senate, a 
point which the senators carried, out of hatred for the accuser, 
notwithstanding the intrigues of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p>That same year the emperor was often heard to say that the legal 
decisions of the commissioners of the imperial treasury ought to have the 
same force as if pronounced by himself. Lest it might be supposed that he 
had stumbled inadvertently into this opinion, its principle was also secured 
by a decree of the Senate on a more complete and ample scale than before. It 
had indeed already been arranged by the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name> that the Roman 
knights who governed <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> should hear causes, and 
that their decisions were to be as binding as those of Roman magistrates, 
and after a time most of the cases formerly tried by the pr&aelig;tors were 
submitted to the knights. <name type="person">Claudius</name> handed over to them the whole 
administration of justice for which there had been by

sedition or 
war so many struggles; the Sempronian laws resting judicial power in the 
equestrian order, and those of <name type="person">Servilius</name> restoring it to the Senate, while 
it was for this above everything else that <name type="person">Marius</name> and <name type="person">Sulla</name> fought of old. 
But those were days of political conflict between classes, and the results 
of victory were binding on the State. <name type="person">Caius Oppius</name> and <name type="person">Cornelius Balbus</name> were 
the first who were able, with <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s support, to settle conditions of 
peace and terms of war. To mention after them the Matii, Vedii, and other 
too influential names of Roman knights would be superfluous, when <name type="person">Claudius</name>, 
we know, raised freedmen whom he had set over his household to equality with 
himself and with the laws.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>Next the 
emperor proposed to grant immunity from taxation to the people of <rs type="placename">Cos</rs>, and he dwelt much on their antiquity. "The <name type="ethnic">Argives</name> 
or <name type="person">C&oelig;us</name>, the father of <name type="person">Latona</name>, were the earliest inhabitants of the 
island; soon afterwards, by the arrival of <name type="person">&AElig;sculapius</name>, the art of the 
physician was introduced and was practised with much fame by his 
descendants." <name type="person">Claudius</name> named them one by one, with the periods in which they 
had respectively flourished. He said too that <name type="person">Xenophon</name>, of whose medical 
skill he availed himself, was one of the same family, and that they ought to 
grant his request and let the people of <rs type="placename">Cos</rs> dwell 
free from all tribute in their sacred island, as a place devoted to the sole 
service of their god. It was also certain that many obligations under which 
they had laid <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and joint victories with her 
might have been recounted. <name type="person">Claudius</name> however did not seek to veil under any 
external considerations a concession he had made, with his usual good 
nature, to an individual.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>Envoys from 
<rs type="placename">Byzantium</rs> having received audience, in complaining 
to the Senate of their heavy burdens, recapitulated their whole history. 
Beginning with the treaty which they concluded with us when we fought 
against that king of <rs type="placename">Macedonia</rs> whose supposed 
spurious birth acquired for him the name of the <name type="person">Pseudo Philip</name>, they reminded 
us of the forces which they had afterwards sent against <name type="person">Antiochus</name>, <name type="person">Perses</name> 
and <name type="person">Aristonicus</name>, of the aid they had given <name type="person">Antonius</name> in the pirate-war, of 
their offers to <name type="person">Sulla</name>, <name type="person">Lucullus</name>, and <name type="person">Pompeius</name>, and then of their late 
services to the C&aelig;sars,

when 
they were in occupation of a district peculiarly convenient for the land or 
sea passage of generals and armies, as well as for the conveyance of 
supplies.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>It was indeed on that very 
narrow strait which parts <rs type="placename">Europe</rs> from <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, at <rs type="placename">Europe</rs>'s furthest extremity, that the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> 
built <rs type="placename">Byzantium</rs>. When they consulted the <name type="person">Pythian 
Apollo</name> as to where they should found a city, the oracle replied that they 
were to seek a home opposite to the blind men's country. This obscure hint 
pointed to the people of <rs type="placename">Chalcedon</rs>, who, though they 
arrived there first and saw before others the advantageous position, chose 
the worse. For <rs type="placename">Byzantium</rs> has a fruitful soil and 
productive seas, as immense shoals of fish pour out of the <rs type="placename">Pontus</rs> and are driven by the sloping surface of the 
rocks under water to quit the windings of the <rs type="placename">Asiatic shore</rs> and take refuge 
in these harbours. Consequently the inhabitants were at first money-making 
and wealthy traders, but afterwards, under the pressure of excessive 
burdens, they petitioned for immunity or at least relief, and were supported 
by the emperor, who argued to the Senate that, exhausted as they were by the 
late wars in <rs type="placename">Thrace</rs> and <rs type="placename">Bosporus</rs>, they deserved help. So their tribute was 
remitted for five years.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>In the year 
of the consulship of <name type="person">Marcus Asinius</name> and <name type="person">Manius Acilius</name> it was seen to be 
portended by a succession of prodigies that there were to be political 
changes for the worse. The soldiers' standards and tents were set in a blaze 
by lightning. A swarm of bees settled on the summit of the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs>; births 
of monsters, half man, half beast, and of a pig with a hawk's talons, were 
reported. It was accounted a portent that every order of magistrates had had 
its number reduced, a qu&aelig;stor, an &aelig;dile, a tribune, a 
pr&aelig;tor and consul having died within a few months. But <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s 
terror was the most conspicuous. Alarmed by some words dropped by <name type="person">Claudius</name> 
when half intoxicated, that it was his destiny to have to endure his wives' 
infamy and at last punish it, she determined to act without a moment's 
delay. First she destroyed <name type="person">Lepida</name> from motives of feminine jealousy. <name type="person">Lepida</name> 
indeed as the daughter of the younger <name type="person">Antonia</name>, as the grandniece of 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, the cousin of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and sister of her husband <name type="person">Cneius</name>, thought 
herself of equally high rank. In

beauty, youth, and wealth they 
differed but sightly. Both were shameless, infamous, and intractable, and 
were rivals in vice as much as in the advantages they had derived from 
fortune. It was indeed a desperate contest whether the aunt or the mother 
should have most power over <name type="person"><placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName></name>. <name type="person">Lepida</name> tried to win the young prince's 
heart by flattery and lavish liberality, while <name type="person">Agrippina</name> on the other hand, 
who could give her son empire but could not endure that he should be 
emperor, was fierce and full of menace.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>It was charged on <name type="person">Lepida</name> that she had made attempts on the 
emperor's consort by magical incantations, and was disturbing the peace of 
<rs type="placename">Italy</rs> by an imperfect control of her troops of 
slaves in <rs type="placename">Calabria</rs>. She was for this sentenced to 
death, notwithstanding the vehement opposition of <name type="person">Narcissus</name>, who, as he more 
and more suspected <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, was said to have plainly told his intimate 
friends that "his destruction was certain, whether <name type="person">Britannicus</name> or <name type="person"><placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName></name> were 
to be emperor, but that he was under such obligations to <name type="person">Claudius</name> that he 
would sacrifice life to his welfare. <name type="person">Messalina</name> and <name type="person">Silius</name> had been 
convicted, and now again there were similar grounds for accusation. If <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> 
were to rule, or <name type="person">Britannicus</name> succeed to the throne, he would himself have no 
claim on the then reigning sovereign. Meanwhile, a stepmother's treacherous 
schemes were convulsing the whole imperial house, with far greater disgrace 
than would have resulted from his concealment of the profligacy of the 
emperor's former wife. Even as it was, there was shamelessness enough, 
seeing that <name type="person">Pallas</name> was her paramour, so that no one could doubt that she 
held honour, modesty and her very person, everything, in short, cheaper than 
sovereignty." </p>
<p>This, and the like, he was always saying, and he would 
embrace <name type="person">Britannicus</name>, expressing earnest wishes for his speedy arrival at a 
mature age, and would raise his hand, now to heaven, now to the young 
prince, with entreaty that as he grew up, he would drive out his father's 
enemies and also take vengeance on the murderers of his mother.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>Under this great burden of anxiety, he had 
an attack of illness, and went to <rs type="placename">Sinuessa</rs> to 
recruit his strength with its balmy climate and salubrious waters. 
Thereupon, <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, who had long decided on the crime and eagerly

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AGRIPPINA POISONS CLAUDIUS</note>
grasped at the opportunity 
thus offered, and did not lack instruments, deliberated on the nature of the 
poison to be used. The deed would be betrayed by one that was sudden and 
instantaneous, while if she chose a slow and lingering poison, there was a 
fear that <name type="person">Claudius</name>, when near his end, might, on detecting the treachery, 
return to his love for his son. She decided on some rare compound which 
might derange his mind and delay death. A person skilled in such matters was 
selected, <name type="person">Locusta</name> by name, who had lately been condemned for poisoning, and 
had long been retained as one of the tools of despotism. By this woman's art 
the poison was prepared, and it was to be administered by an eunuch, 
Halotus, who was accustomed to bring in and taste the dishes.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p>All the circumstances were subsequently so well 
known, that writers of the time have declared that the poison was infused 
into some mushrooms, a favourite delicacy, and its effect not at the instant 
perceived, from the emperor's lethargic, or intoxicated condition. His 
bowels too were relieved, and this seemed to have saved him. <name type="person">Agrippina</name> was 
thoroughly dismayed. Fearing the worst, and defying the immediate obloquy of 
the deed, she availed herself of the complicity of <name type="person">Xenophon</name>, the physician, 
which she had already secured. Under pretence of helping the emperor's 
efforts to vomit, this man, it is supposed, introduced into his throat a 
feather smeared with some rapid poison; for he knew that the greatest crimes 
are perilous in their inception, but well rewarded after their 
consummation.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>Meanwhile the Senate 
was summoned, and prayers rehearsed by the consuls and priests for the 
emperor's recovery, though the lifeless body was being wrapped in blankets 
with warm applications, while all was being arranged to establish <name type="person">Nero</name> on 
the throne. At first <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, seemingly overwhelmed by grief and seeking 
comfort, clasped <name type="person">Britannicus</name> in her embraces, called him the very image of 
his father, and hindered him by every possible device from leaving the 
chamber. She also detained his sisters, <name type="person">Antonia</name> and <name type="person">Octavia</name>, closed every 
approach to the palace with a military guard, and repeatedly gave out that 
the emperor's health was better, so that the soldiers might be 
encouraged

to hope, and that the fortunate moment foretold by the 
astrologers might arrive.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p>At last, at 
noon on the 13th of October, the gates of the palace were suddenly thrown 
open, and <name type="person">Nero</name>, accompanied by <name type="person">Burrus</name>, went forth to the cohort which was on 
guard after military custom. There, at the suggestion of the commanding 
officer, he was hailed with joyful shouts, and set on a litter. Some, it is 
said, hesitated, and looked round and asked where <name type="person">Britannicus</name> was; then, 
when there was no one to lead a resistance, they yielded to what was offered 
them. <name type="person">Nero</name> was conveyed into the camp, and having first spoken suitably to 
the occasion and promised a donative after the example of his father's 
bounty, he was unanimously greeted as emperor. The decrees of the Senate 
followed the voice of the soldiers, and there was no hesitation in the 
provinces. Divine honours were decreed to <name type="person">Claudius</name>, and his funeral rites 
were solemnized on the same scale as those of <name type="person">Augustus</name>; for <name type="person">Agrippina</name> strove 
to emulate the magnificence of her great-grandmother, <name type="person">Livia</name>. But his will 
was not publicly read, as the preference of the stepson to the son might 
provoke a sense of wrong and angry feeling in the popular 
mind.</p></div2></div1>

<head>BOOK XIII</head>
<head><dateRange from="54" to="58">A.D. 54&mdash;58</dateRange></head> <div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>The first death under the new emperor, that of <name type="person">Junius Silanus</name>, 
proconsul of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, was, without <name type="person">Nero</name>'s knowledge, 
planned by the treachery of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>. Not that <name type="person">Silanus</name> had provoked 
destruction by any violence of temper, apathetic as he was, and so utterly 
despised under former despotisms, that <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> used to call him 
the golden sheep. The truth was that <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, having contrived the murder 
of his brother <name type="person">Lucius Silanus</name>, dreaded his vengeance; for it was the 
incessant popular talk that preference ought to be given over <name type="person">Nero</name>, who was 
scarcely out of his boyhood and had gained the empire by crime, to a man of 
mature age, of blameless life, of noble birth, and, as a point then much 
regarded, of the line of the C&aelig;sars. <name type="person">Silanus</name> in fact was the son of a 
great-grandson of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. This was the cause of his destruction. The 
agents of the deed were <name type="person">Publius Celer</name>, a Roman knight, and <name type="person">Helius</name>, a 
freedman, men who had the charge of the emperor's domains in <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>. They gave the proconsul poison at a banquet, too 
openly to escape discovery. </p>
<p>With no less precipitation, <name type="person">Narcissus</name>, 
<name type="person">Claudius</name>'s freedman, whose quarrels with <name type="person">Agrippina</name> I have mentioned, was 
driven to suicide by his cruel imprisonment and hopeless plight, even 
against the wishes of <name type="person">Nero</name>, with whose yet concealed vices he was 
wonderfully in sympathy from his rapacity and extravagance.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>And now they had proceeded to further murders but for 
the opposition of <name type="person">Afranius Burrus</name> and <name type="person">Ann&aelig;us Seneca</name>. These two men 
guided the emperor's youth with an unity of purpose seldom found where 
authority is shared, and though their accomplishments were wholly different, 
they had equal 

influence. <name type="person">Burrus</name>, with his soldier's discipline 
and severe manners, <name type="person">Seneca</name>, with lessons of eloquence and a dignified 
courtesy, strove alike to confine the frailty of the prince's youth, should 
he loathe virtue, within allowable indulgences. They had both alike to 
struggle against the domineering spirit of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, who inflamed with all 
the passions of an evil ascendency had <name type="person">Pallas</name> on her side, at whose 
suggestion <name type="person">Claudius</name> had ruined himself by an incestuous marriage and a fatal 
adoption of a son. <name type="person">Nero</name>'s temper however was not one to submit to slaves, 
and <name type="person">Pallas</name>, by a surly arrogance quite beyond a freedman, had provoked 
disgust. Still every honour was openly heaped on <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and to a tribune 
who according to military custom asked the watchword, <name type="person">Nero</name> gave "the best of 
mothers." The Senate also decreed her two lictors, with the office of 
priestess to <name type="person">Claudius</name>, and voted to the late emperor a censor's funeral, 
which was soon followed by deification.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>On the day of the funeral the prince pronounced <name type="person">Claudius</name>'s panegyric, and 
while he dwelt on the antiquity of his family and on the consulships and 
triumphs of his ancestors, there was enthusiasm both in himself and his 
audience. The praise of his graceful accomplishments, and the remark that 
during his reign no disaster had befallen <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> from 
the foreigner, were heard with favour. When the speaker passed on to his 
foresight and wisdom, no one could refrain from laughter, though the speech, 
which was composed by <name type="person">Seneca</name>, exhibited much elegance, as indeed that famous 
man had an attractive genius which suited the popular ear of the time. 
Elderly men who amuse their leisure with comparing the past and the present, 
observed that <name type="person">Nero</name> was the first emperor who needed another man's eloquence. 
The dictator <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> rivalled the greatest orators, and <name type="person">Augustus</name> had an 
easy and fluent way of speaking, such as became a sovereign. <name type="person">Tiberius</name> too 
thoroughly understood the art of balancing words, and was sometimes forcible 
in the expression of his thoughts, or else intentionally obscure. Even <name type="person">Caius 
C&aelig;sar</name>'s disordered intellect did not wholly mar his faculty of speech. 
Nor did <name type="person">Claudius</name>, when he spoke with preparation, lack elegance. <name type="person">Nero</name> from 
early boyhood turned his lively genius in other directions; he carved, 
painted,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROMISING BEGINNING OF NERO'S REIGN</note>
sang, 
or practised the management of horses, occasionally composing verses which 
showed that he had the rudiments of learning.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>When he had done with his mimicries of sorrow he entered the 
Senate, and having first referred to the authority of the senators and the 
concurrence of the soldiery, he then dwelt on the counsels and examples 
which he had to guide him in the right administration of empire. "His 
boyhood," he said, "had not had the taint of civil wars or domestic feuds, 
and he brought with him no hatreds, no sense of wrong, no desire of 
vengeance." He then sketched the plan of his future government, carefully 
avoiding anything which had kindled recent odium. "He would not," he said, 
"be judge in all cases, or, by confining the accuser and the accused within 
the same walls, let the power of a few favourites grow dangerously 
formidable. In his house there should be nothing venal, nothing open to 
intrigue; his private establishment and the State should be kept entirely 
distinct. The Senate should retain its ancient powers; <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> and the State-provinces should plead their causes 
before the tribunals of the consuls, who would give them a hearing from the 
senators. Of the armies he would himself take charge, as specially entrusted 
to him."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>He was true to his word and 
several arrangements were made on the Senate's authority. No one was to 
receive a fee or a present for pleading a cause; the qu&aelig;stors-elect 
were not to be under the necessity of exhibiting gladiatorial shows. This 
was opposed by <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, as a reversal of the legislation of <name type="person">Claudius</name>, but 
it was carried by the senators who used to be summoned to the palace, in 
order that she might stand close to a hidden door behind them, screened by a 
curtain which was enough to shut her out of sight, but not out of hearing. 
When envoys from <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> were pleading their 
nation's cause before <name type="person">Nero</name>, she actually was on the point of mounting the 
emperor's tribunal and of presiding with him; but <name type="person">Seneca</name>, when every one 
else was paralysed with alarm, motioned to the prince to go and meet his 
mother. Thus, by an apparently dutiful act, a scandalous scene was 
prevented.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>With the close of the year 
came disquieting rumours

that the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> had again broken 
their bounds and were ravaging <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, from which 
they had driven <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name>, who, having often possessed himself of the 
kingdom and as often been thrust out of it, had now relinquished 
hostilities. <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> with its love of talking began to 
ask how a prince of scarce seventeen was to encounter and avert this 
tremendous peril, how they could fall back on one who was ruled by a woman; 
or whether battles and sieges and the other operations of war could be 
directed by tutors. "Some, on the contrary, argued that this was better than 
it would have been, had <name type="person">Claudius</name> in his feeble and spiritless old age, when 
he would certainly have yielded to the bidding of slaves, been summoned to 
the hardships of a campaign. <name type="person">Burrus</name>, at least, and <name type="person">Seneca</name> were known to be 
men of very varied experience, and, as for the emperor himself, how far was 
he really short of mature age, when <name type="person">Cneius Pompeius</name> and <name type="person">C&aelig;sar 
Octavianus</name>, in their eighteenth and nineteenth years respectively, bore the 
brunt of civil wars? The highest rank chiefly worked through its prestige 
and its counsels more than by the sword and hand. The emperor would give a 
plain proof whether he was advised by good or bad friends by putting aside 
all jealousy and selecting some eminent general, rather than by promoting 
out of favouritism, a rich man backed up by interest."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>Amidst this and like popular talk, Nero ordered the 
young recruits levied in the adjacent provinces to be brought up for the 
supply of the legions of the <rs type="placename">East</rs>, and the legions 
themselves to take up a position on the Armenian frontier while two princes 
of old standing, <name type="person">Agrippa</name> and <name type="person">Antiochus</name>, were to prepare a force for the 
invasion of the Parthian territories. The <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs> 
too was to be spanned by bridges; <rs type="placename">Lesser Armenia</rs> was 
intrusted to <name type="person">Aristobulus</name>, <rs type="placename">Sophene</rs> to <name type="person">Soh&aelig;mus</name>, each with the ensigns of 
royalty. There rose up at this crisis a rival to <name type="person">Vologeses</name> in his son 
<name type="person">Vardanes</name>, and the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> quitted <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, 
apparently intending to defer hostilities.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>All this however was described with exaggeration to the Senate, in 
the speeches of those members who proposed a public thanksgiving, and that 
on the days of the thanksgiving the prince should wear the triumphal robe 
and enter

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PARTHIANS INVADE <rs type="placename">ARMENIA</rs></note>
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> in ovation, 
lastly, that he should have statues on the same scale as those of <name type="person">Mars</name> the 
Avenger, and in the same temple. To their habitual flattery was added a real 
joy at his having appointed <name type="person">Domitius Corbulo</name> to secure <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, thus opening, as it seemed, a field to merit. 
The armies of the <rs type="placename">East</rs> were so divided that half the 
auxiliaries and two legions were to remain in the province of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> under its governor, <name type="person">Quadratus Ummidius</name>; while 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name> was to have an equal number of citizen and allied troops, together 
with the auxiliary infantry and cavalry which were in winter quarters in <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs>. The confederate kings were instructed to 
obey orders, just as the war might require. But they had a specially strong 
liking for <name type="person">Corbulo</name>. That general, with a view to the prestige which in a new 
enterprise is supremely powerful, speedily accomplished his march, and at 
<rs type="placename">&AElig;ge&aelig;</rs>, a city of <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>, met <name type="person">Quadratus</name> who had advanced to the place 
under an apprehension that, should <name type="person">Corbulo</name> once enter <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> to take command of the army, he would draw all 
eyes on himself, by his noble stature, his imposing eloquence, and the 
impression he would make, not only by his wisdom and experience, but also by 
the mere display of showy attributes.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Meantime both sent messages to king <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, advising him to choose peace 
rather than war, and to give hostages and so continue the habitual reverence 
of his ancestors towards the people of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. 
<name type="person">Vologeses</name>, wishing to prepare for war at an advantage, or to rid himself of 
suspected rivals under the name of hostages, delivered up some of the 
noblest of the Arsacids. A centurion, <name type="person">Insteius</name>, sent perhaps by <name type="person">Ummidius</name> on 
some previous occasion, received them after an interview with the king. 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name>, on knowing this, ordered <name type="person">Arrius Varus</name>, commander of a cohort, to go 
and take the hostages. Hence arose a quarrel between the commander and the 
centurion, and to stop such a scene before foreigners, the decision of the 
matter was left to the hostages and to the envoys who conducted them. They 
preferred <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, for his recent renown, and from a liking which even 
enemies felt for him. Then there was a feud between the two generals; 
<name type="person">Ummidius</name> complained that he was robbed of what his prudence had achieved, 
while <name type="person">Corbulo</name> on the other hand

appealed to the fact that 
Vologeses had not brought himself to offer hostages till his own appointment 
to the conduct of the war turned the king's hopes into fears. <name type="person">Nero</name>, to 
compose their differences, directed the issue of a proclamation that for the 
successes of <name type="person">Quadratus</name> and <name type="person">Corbulo</name> the laurel was to be added to the 
imperial "fasces." I have closely connected these events, though they extend 
into another consulship.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>The emperor 
in the same year asked the Senate for a statue to his father <name type="person">Domitius</name>, and 
also that the consular decorations might be conferred on <name type="person">Asconius Labeo</name>, who 
had been his guardian. Statues to himself of solid gold and silver he 
forbade, in opposition to offers made, and although the Senate passed a vote 
that the year should begin with the month of December, in which he was born, 
he retained for its commencement, the old sacred associations of the first 
of January. Nor would he allow the prosecution of <name type="person">Carinas Celer</name>, a senator, 
whom a slave accused, or of <name type="person">Julius Densus</name>, a knight, whose partiality for 
<name type="person">Britannicus</name> was construed into a crime.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>In the year of his consulship with <name type="person">Lucius Antistius</name>, when the 
magistrates were swearing obedience to imperial legislation, he forbade his 
colleague to extend the oath to his own enactments, for which he was warmly 
praised by the senators, in the hope that his youthful spirit, elated with 
the glory won by trifles, would follow on to nobler aspirations. Then came 
an act of mercy to <name type="person">Plautius Lateranus</name>, who had been degraded from his rank 
for adultery with <name type="person">Messalina</name>, and whom he now restored, assuring them of his 
clemency in a number of speeches which <name type="person">Seneca</name>, to show the purity of his 
teaching or to display his genius, published to the world by the emperor's 
mouth.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>Meanwhile the mother's 
influence was gradually weakened, as <name type="person">Nero</name> fell in love with a freedwoman, 
<name type="person">Acte</name> by name, and took into his confidence <name type="person">Otho</name> and <name type="person">Claudius Senecio</name>, two 
young men of fashion, the first of whom was descended from a family of 
consular rank, while <name type="person">Senecio</name>'s father was one of the emperor's freedmen. 
Without the mother's knowledge, then in spite of her opposition, they had 
crept into his favour by debaucheries and equivocal

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO 
LOVES ACTE; AGRIPPINA JEALOUS</note>
secrets, and even the prince's older 
friends did not thwart him, for here was a girl who without harm to any one 
gratified his desires, when he loathed his wife <name type="person">Octavia</name>, high born as she 
was, and of approved virtue, either from some fatality, or because vice is 
overpoweringly attractive. It was feared too that he might rush into 
outrages on noble ladies, were he debarred from this indulgence.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p><name type="person">Agrippina</name>, however, raved with a woman's 
fury about having a freedwoman for a rival, a slave girl for a 
daughter-in-law, with like expressions. Nor would she wait till her son 
repented or wearied of his passion. The fouler her reproaches, the more 
powerfully did they inflame him, till completely mastered by the strength of 
his desire, he threw off all respect for his mother, and put himself under 
the guidance of <name type="person">Seneca</name>, one of whose friends, <name type="person">Ann&aelig;us Serenus</name>, had 
veiled the young prince's intrigue in its beginning by pretending to be in 
love with the same woman, and had lent his name as the ostensible giver of 
the presents secretly sent by the emperor to the girl. Then <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, 
changing her tactics, plied the lad with various blandishments, and even 
offered the seclusion of her chamber for the concealment of indulgences 
which youth and the highest rank might claim. She went further; she pleaded 
guilty to an ill-timed strictness, and handed over to him the abundance of 
her wealth, which nearly approached the imperial treasures, and from having 
been of late extreme in her restraint of her son, became now, on the other 
hand, lax to excess. The change did not escape <name type="person">Nero</name>; his most intimate 
friends dreaded it, and begged him to beware of the arts of a woman, who was 
always daring and was now false. </p>
<p>It happened at this time that the 
emperor after inspecting the apparel in which wives and mothers of the 
imperial house had been seen to glitter, selected a jewelled robe and sent 
it as a gift to his mother, with the unsparing liberality of one who was 
bestowing by preference on her a choice and much coveted present. <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, 
however, publicly declared that so far from her wardrobe being furnished by 
these gifts, she was really kept out of the remainder, and that her son was 
merely dividing with her what he derived wholly from herself.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>Some there were who put even a worse 
meaning on her words. And so <name type="person">Nero</name>, furious with those who abetted such 
arrogance in a woman, removed <name type="person">Pallas</name> from the charge of the business with 
which he had been entrusted by <name type="person">Claudius</name>, and in which he acted, so to say, 
as the controller of the throne. The story went that as he was departing 
with a great retinue of attendants, the emperor rather wittily remarked that 
<name type="person">Pallas</name> was going to swear himself out of office. <name type="person">Pallas</name> had in truth 
stipulated that he should not be questioned for anything he had done in the 
past, and that his accounts with the State were to be considered as 
balanced. Thereupon, with instant fury, <name type="person">Agrippina</name> rushed into frightful 
menaces, sparing not the prince's ears her solemn protest "that <name type="person">Britannicus</name> 
was now of full age, he who was the true and worthy heir of his father's 
sovereignty, which a son, by mere admission and adoption, was abusing in 
outrages on his mother. She shrank not from an utter exposure of the 
wickedness of that ill-starred house, of her own marriage, to begin with, 
and of her poisoner's craft. All that the gods and she herself had taken 
care of was that her stepson was yet alive; with him she would go to the 
camp, where on one side should be heard the daughter of <name type="person">Germanicus</name> on the 
other, the crippled <name type="person">Burrus</name> and the exile <name type="person">Seneca</name> claiming, forsooth, with 
disfigured hand, and a pedant's tongue, the government of the world." As she 
spoke, she raised her hand in menace and heaped insults on him, as she 
appealed to the deified <name type="person">Claudius</name>, to the infernal shades of the Silani, and 
to those many fruitless crimes.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> 
was confounded at this, and as the day was near on which <name type="person">Britannicus</name> would 
complete his fourteenth year, he reflected, now on the domineering temper of 
his mother, and now again on the character of the young prince, which a 
trifling circumstance had lately tested, sufficient however to gain for him 
wide popularity. During the feast of <name type="person">Saturn</name>, amid other pastimes of his 
playmates, at a game of lot drawing for king, the lot fell to <name type="person">Nero</name>, upon 
which he gave all his other companions different orders, and such as would 
not put them to the blush; but when he told <name type="person">Britannicus</name> to step forward and 
begin a song, hoping for a laugh at the expense of a boy who knew nothing of 
sober much less of riotous

society, the lad with perfect coolness commenced some 
verses which hinted at his expulsion from his father's house and from 
supreme power. This procured him pity, which was the more conspicuous, as 
night with its merriment had stript off all disguise. Nero saw the reproach 
and redoubled his hate. Pressed by <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s menaces, having no charge 
against his brother and not daring openly to order his murder, he meditated 
a secret device and directed poison to be prepared through the agency of 
<name type="person">Julius Pollio</name>, tribune of one of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts, who had in his 
custody a woman under sentence for poisoning, <name type="person">Locusta</name> by name, with a vast 
reputation for crime. That every one about the person of <name type="person">Britannicus</name> should 
care nothing for right or honour, had long ago been provided for. He 
actually received his first dose of poison from his tutors and passed it off 
his bowels, as it was rather weak or so qualified as not at once to prove 
deadly. But <name type="person">Nero</name>, impatient at such slow progress in crime, threatened the 
tribune and ordered the poisoner to execution for prolonging his anxiety 
while they were thinking of the popular talk and planning their own defence. 
Then they promised that death should be as sudden as if it were the hurried 
work of the dagger, and a rapid poison of previously tested ingredients was 
prepared close to the emperor's chamber.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>It was customary for the imperial princes to sit during their 
meals with other nobles of the same age, in the sight of their kinsfolk, at 
a table of their own, furnished somewhat frugally. There <name type="person">Britannicus</name> was 
dining, and as what he ate and drank was always tested by the taste of a 
select attendant, the following device was contrived, that the usage might 
not be dropped or the crime betrayed by the death of both prince and 
attendant. A cup as yet harmless, but extremely hot and already tasted, was 
handed to <name type="person">Britannicus</name>; then, on his refusing it because of its warmth, 
poison was poured in with some cold water, and this so penetrated his entire 
frame that he lost alike voice and breath. There was a stir among the 
company; some, taken by surprise, ran hither and thither, while those whose 
discernment was keener, remained motionless, with their eyes fixed on <name type="person">Nero</name>, 
who, as he still reclined in seeming unconsciousness, said that this was a 
common occurrence: from a periodical epilepsy, with

which 
<name type="person">Britannicus</name> had been afflicted from his earliest infancy, and that his sight 
and senses would gradually return. As for <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, her terror and 
confusion, though her countenance struggled to hide it, so visibly appeared, 
that she was clearly just as ignorant as was <name type="person">Octavia</name>, <name type="person">Britannicus</name>'s own 
sister. She saw, in fact, that she was robbed of her only remaining refuge, 
and that here was a precedent for parricide. Even <name type="person">Octavia</name>, notwithstanding 
her youthful inexperience, had learnt to hide her grief, her affection, and 
indeed every emotion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>And so after a 
brief pause the company resumed its mirth. One and the same night witnessed 
<name type="person">Britannicus</name>'s death and funeral, preparations having been already made for 
his obsequies, which were on a humble scale. He was however buried in the 
<rs type="placename">Campus Martius</rs>, amid storms so violent, that in the popular belief they 
portended the wrath of heaven against a crime which many were even inclined 
to forgive when they remembered the immemorial feuds of brothers and the 
impossibility of a divided throne. It is related by several writers of the 
period that many days before the murder, <name type="person">Nero</name> had offered the worst insult 
to the boyhood of <name type="person">Britannicus</name>; so that his death could no longer seem a 
premature or dreadful event, though it happened at the sacred board, without 
even a moment for the embraces of his sisters, hurried on too, as it was, 
under the eyes of an enemy, on the sole surviving offspring of the Claudii, 
the victim first of dishonour, then of poison. The emperor apologised for 
the hasty funeral by reminding people that it was the practice of our 
ancestors to withdraw from view any grievously untimely death, and not to 
dwell on it with panegyrics or display. For himself, he said, that as he had 
now lost a brother's help, his remaining hopes centred in the State, and all 
the more tenderness ought to be shown by the Senate and people towards a 
prince who was the only survivor of a family born to the highest 
greatness.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>He then enriched his most 
powerful friends with liberal presents. Some there were who reproached men 
of austere professions with having on such an occasion divided houses and 
estates among themselves, like so much spoil. It was the belief of others 
that a pressure had been put on them

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AGRIPPINA IN 
ECLIPSE</note>
by the emperor, who, conscious as he was of guilt, hoped for 
merciful consideration if he could secure the most important men by 
wholesale bribery. But his mother's rage no lavish bounty could allay. She 
would clasp <name type="person">Octavia</name> to her arms, and have many a secret interview with her 
friends; with more than her natural rapacity, she clutched at money 
everywhere, seemingly for a reserve, and courteously received tribunes and 
centurions. She honoured the names and virtues of the nobles who still were 
left, seeking apparently a party and a leader. Of this <name type="person">Nero</name> became aware, 
and he ordered the departure of the military guard now kept for the 
emperor's mother, as it had formerly been for the imperial consort, along 
with some German troops, added as a further honour. He also gave her a 
separate establishment, that throngs of visitors might no longer wait on 
her, and removed her to what had been <name type="person">Antonia</name>'s house; and whenever he went 
there himself, he was surrounded by a crowd of centurions, and used to leave 
her after a hurried kiss.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>Of all 
things human the most precarious and transitory is a reputation for power 
which has no strong support of its own. In a moment <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s doors were 
deserted; there was no one to comfort or to go near her, except a few 
ladies, whether out of love or malice was doubtful. One of these was <name type="person">Junia 
Silana</name>, whom <name type="person">Messalina</name> had driven from her husband, <name type="person">Caius Silius</name>, as I have 
already related. Conspicuous for her birth, her beauty, and her wantonness, 
she had long been a special favourite of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, till after a while there 
were secret mutual dislikes, because <name type="person">Sextius Africanus</name>, a noble youth, had 
been deterred from marrying <name type="person">Silana</name> by <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, who repeatedly spoke of her 
as an immodest woman in the decline of life, not to secure <name type="person">Africanus</name> for 
herself, but to keep the childless and wealthy widow out of a husband's 
control. <name type="person">Silana</name> having now a prospect of vengeance, suborned as accusers two 
of her creatures, <name type="person">Iturius</name> and <name type="person">Calvisius</name>, not with the old and often-repeated 
charges about <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s mourning the death of <name type="person">Britannicus</name> or publishing 
the wrongs of <name type="person">Octavia</name>, but with a hint that it was her purpose to encourage 
in revolutionary designs <name type="person">Rubellius Plautus</name>, who on his mother's side was as 
nearly connected as <name type="person">Nero</name> with the Divine <name type="person">Augustus</name>; and then, by marrying

him and making him emperor, again seize the control of the State. All 
this <name type="person">Iturius</name> and <name type="person">Calvisius</name> divulged to <name type="person">Atimetus</name>, a freedman of <name type="person">Domitia</name>, 
<name type="person">Nero</name>'s aunt. Exulting in the opportunity, for <name type="person">Agrippina</name> and <name type="person">Domitia</name> were in 
bitter rivalry, <name type="person">Atimetus</name> urged <name type="person">Paris</name>, who was himself also a freedman of 
<name type="person">Domitia</name>, to go at once and put the charge in the most dreadful form.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>Night was far advanced and <name type="person">Nero</name> was still 
sitting over his cups, when <name type="person">Paris</name> entered, who was generally wont at such 
times to heighten the emperor's enjoyments, but who now wore a gloomy 
expression. He went through the whole evidence in order, and so frightened 
his hearer as to make him resolve not only on the destruction of his mother 
and of <name type="person">Plautus</name>, but also on the removal of <name type="person">Burrus</name> from the command of the 
guards, as a man who had been promoted by <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s interest, and was now 
showing his gratitude. We have it on the authority of <name type="person">Fabius Rusticus</name> that a 
note was written to <name type="person">C&aelig;cina Tuscus</name>, intrusting to him the charge of the 
pr&aelig;torian cohorts, but that through <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s influence that 
distinguished post was retained for <name type="person">Burrus</name>. According to <name type="person">Plinius</name> and 
<name type="person">Cluvius</name>, no doubt was felt about the commander's loyalty. <name type="person">Fabius</name> certainly 
inclines to the praise of <name type="person">Seneca</name>, through whose friendship he rose to 
honour. Proposing as I do to follow the consentient testimony of historians, 
I shall give the differences in their narratives under the writers' names. 
<name type="person">Nero</name>, in his bewilderment and impatience to destroy his mother, could not be 
put off till <name type="person">Burrus</name> answered for her death, should she be convicted of the 
crime, but "any one," he said, "much more a parent, must be allowed a 
defence. Accusers there were none forthcoming; they had before them only the 
word of a single person from an enemy's house, and this the night with its 
darkness and prolonged festivity and everything savouring of recklessness 
and folly, was enough to refute."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>Having thus allayed the prince's fears, they went at daybreak to <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, 
that she might know the charges against her, and either rebut them or suffer 
the penalty. <name type="person">Burrus</name> fulfilled his instructions in <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s presence, and 
some of the freedmen were present to witness the interview. Then <name type="person">Burrus</name>, 
when he had fully explained the charges with the

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO 
DETERMINES AGRIPPINA'S DEATH</note>
authors' names, assumed an air of 
menace. Instantly <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, calling up all her high spirit, exclaimed, "I 
wonder not that <name type="person">Silana</name>, who has never borne offspring, knows nothing of a 
mother's feelings. Parents do not change their children as lightly as a 
shameless woman does her paramours. And if <name type="person">Iturius</name> and <name type="person">Calvisius</name>, after 
having wasted their whole fortunes, are now, as their last resource, 
repaying an old hag for their hire by undertaking to be informers, it does 
not follow that I am to incur the infamy of plotting a son's murder, or that 
a <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> is to have the consciousness of like guilt. As for <name type="person">Domitia</name>'s 
enmity, I should be thankful for it, were she to vie with me in goodwill 
towards my <name type="person">Nero</name>. Now through her paramour, <name type="person">Atimetus</name>, and the actor, <name type="person">Paris</name>, 
she is, so to say, concocting a drama for the stage. She at her <rs type="placename">Baiae</rs> was increasing the magnificence of her fishponds, 
when I was planning in my counsels his adoption with a proconsul's powers 
and a consul-elect's rank and every other step to empire. Only let the man 
come forward who can charge me with having tampered with the pr&aelig;torian 
cohorts in the capital, with having sapped the loyalty of the provinces, or, 
in a word, with having bribed slaves and freedmen into any wickedness. Could 
I have lived with <name type="person">Britannicus</name> in the possession of power? And if <name type="person">Plautus</name> or 
any other were to become master of the State so as to sit in judgment on me, 
accusers forsooth would not be forthcoming, to charge me not merely with a 
few incautious expressions prompted by the eagerness of affection, but with 
guilt from which a son alone could absolve me." </p>
<p>There was profound 
excitement among those present, and they even tried to soothe her agitation, 
but she insisted on an interview with her son. Then, instead of pleading her 
innocence, as though she lacked confidence, or her claims on him by way of 
reproach, she obtained vengeance on her accusers and rewards for her 
friends.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>The superintendence of the 
corn supply was given to <name type="person">F&aelig;nius Rufus</name>, the direction of the games 
which the emperor was preparing, to <name type="person">Arruntius Stella</name>, and the province of 
<rs type="placename">Egypt</rs> to <name type="person">Caius Balbillus</name>. <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> was to be assigned to <name type="person">Publius Anteius</name>, but he was 
soon put off by various artifices and finally detained at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. <name type="person">Silana</name> was banished; <name type="person">Calvisius</name>

and 
<name type="person">Iturius</name> exiled for a time; <name type="person">Atimetus</name> was capitally punished, while <name type="person">Paris</name> was 
too serviceable to the emperor's profligacy to allow of his suffering any 
penalty. <name type="person">Plautus</name> for the present was silently passed over.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>Next <name type="person">Pallas</name> and <name type="person">Burrus</name> were accused of having 
conspired to raise <name type="person">Cornelius Sulla</name> to the throne, because of his noble birth 
and connection with <name type="person">Claudius</name>, whose son-in-law he was by his marriage with 
<name type="person">Antonia</name>. The promoter of the prosecution was one <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>, who had become 
notorious by frequent purchases of property confiscated to the exchequer and 
was now convicted clearly of imposture. But the proved innocence of <name type="person">Pallas</name> 
did not please men so much, as his arrogance offended them. When his 
freedmen, his alleged accomplices, were called, he replied that at home he 
signified his wishes only by a nod or a gesture, or, if further explanation 
was required, he used writing, so as not to degrade his voice in such 
company. <name type="person">Burrus</name>, though accused, gave his verdict as one of the judges. The 
prosecutor was sentenced to exile, and the account-books in which he was 
reviving forgotten claims of the exchequer, were burnt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>At the end of the year the cohort usually on guard 
during the games was withdrawn, that there might be a greater show of 
freedom, that the soldiery too might be less demoralised when no longer in 
contact with the licence of the theatre, and that it might be proved whether 
the populace, in the absence of a guard, would maintain their self-control. 
The emperor, on the advice of the augurs, purified <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> by a lustration, as the temples of <name type="person">Jupiter</name> and 
<name type="person">Minerva</name> had been struck by lightning.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>In the consulship of <name type="person">Quintus Volusius</name> and <name type="person">Publius Scipio</name>, there was peace 
abroad, but a disgusting licentiousness at home on the part of <name type="person">Nero</name>, who in 
a slave's disguise, so as to be unrecognized, would wander through the 
streets of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, to brothels and taverns, with 
comrades, who seized on goods exposed for sale and inflicted wounds on any 
whom they encountered, some of these last knowing him so little that he even 
received blows himself, and showed the marks of them in his face. When it 
was notorious that the emperor was the assailant, and the insults on men and 
women of distinction were multiplied, other persons too on the strength

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO'S LICENTIOUSNESS</note>
of a licence once granted under 
<name type="person">Nero</name>'s name, ventured with impunity on the same practices, and had gangs of 
their own till night presented the scenes of a captured city. <name type="person">Julius 
Montanus</name>, a senator, but one who had not yet held any office, happened to 
encounter the prince in the darkness and because he fiercely repulsed his 
attack and then on recognizing him begged for mercy, as though this was a 
reproach, was forced to destroy himself. <name type="person">Nero</name> was for the future more timid, 
and surrounded himself with soldiers and a number of gladiators, who, when a 
fray began on a small scale and seemed a private affair, were to let it 
alone, but, if the injured persons resisted stoutly, they rushed in with 
their swords. He also turned the licence of the games and the enthusiasm for 
the actors into something like a battle by the impunity he allowed, and the 
rewards he offered, and especially by looking on himself, sometimes 
concealed, but often in public view, till, with the people at strife and the 
fear of a worse commotion, the only remedy which could be devised was the 
expulsion of the offending actors from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, and 
the presence once more of the soldiery in the theatre.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>During the same time there was a discussion in the 
Senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class, and a strong demand was made 
that, as a check on the undeserving, patrons should have the right of 
revoking freedom. There were several who supported this. But the consuls did 
not venture to put the motion without the emperor's knowledge, though they 
recorded the Senate's general opinion, to see whether he would sanction the 
arrangement, considering that only a few were opposed to it, while some 
loudly complained that the irreverent spirit which freedom had fostered, had 
broken into such excess, that freedmen would ask their patrons' advice as to 
whether they should treat them with violence, or, as legally, their equals, 
and would actually threaten them with blows, at the same time recommending 
them not to punish. "What right," it was asked, "was conceded to an injured 
patron but that of temporarily banishing the freedman a hundred miles off to 
the shores of <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>? In everything else, legal 
proceedings were equal and the same for both. Some weapon ought to be given 
to the patrons which could not be despised. It would be no grievance for

the enfranchised to have to keep their freedom by the same respectful 
behaviour which had procured it for them. But, as for notorious offenders, 
they deserved to be dragged back into slavery, that fear might be a 
restraint where kindness had had no effect."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>It was argued in reply that, though the guilt of a few ought to 
be the ruin of the men themselves, there should be no diminution of the 
rights of the entire class. "For it was," they contended, "a widely diffused 
body; from it, the city tribes, the various public functionaries, the 
establishments of the magistrates and priests were for the most part 
supplied, as well as the cohorts of the city-guard; very many too of the 
knights and several of the senators derived their origin from no other 
source. If freedmen were to be a separate class, the paucity of the freeborn 
would be conspicuously apparent. Not without good reason had our ancestors, 
in distinguishing the position of the different orders, thrown freedom open 
to all. Again, two kinds of enfranchisement had been instituted, so as to 
leave room for retracting the boon, or for a fresh act of grace. Those whom 
the patron had not emancipated with the freedom-giving rod, were still held, 
as it were, by the bonds of slavery. Every master should carefully consider 
the merits of each case; and be slow to grant what once given could not be 
taken away." </p>
<p>This view prevailed, and the emperor replied to the Senate 
that, whenever freedmen were accused by their patrons, they were to 
investigate each case separately and not to annul any right to their common 
injury. Soon afterwards, his aunt <name type="person">Domitia</name> had her freedman <name type="person">Paris</name> taken from 
her, avowedly by civil law, much to the emperor's disgrace, by whose 
direction a decision that he was freeborn was obtained.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>Still there yet remained some shadow of a free 
state. A contest arose between <name type="person">Vibullius</name>, the pr&aelig;tor, and <name type="person">Antistius</name>, a 
tribune of the people; for the tribune had ordered the release of some 
disorderly applauders of certain actors, whom the pr&aelig;tor had 
imprisoned. The Senate approved the imprisonment, and censured the 
presumption of <name type="person">Antistius</name>. Tribunes were also forbidden to usurp the 
authority of pr&aelig;tors and consuls, or to summon from any part of <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> persons liable to legal proceedings. It was 
further proposed by <name type="person">Lucius Piso</name>,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FREEDMEN AND MAGISTRATES 
RESTRICTED</note>
consul-elect, that tribunes were not to try any case 
in their own houses, that a fine imposed by them was not to be entered on 
the public books by the officials of the exchequer, till four months had 
expired, and that in the meantime appeals were to be allowed, which the 
consuls were to decide. </p><p>Restrictions were also put on the powers of the 
aediles and a limit fixed to the amount of bail or penalty which curule and 
plebeian aediles could respectively exact. On this, <name type="person">Helvidius Priscus</name>, a 
tribune of the people, followed up a personal quarrel he had with 
<name type="person">Obultronius Sabinus</name>, one of the officials of the exchequer, by insinuating 
that he stretched his right of confiscation with merciless rigour against 
the poor. The emperor then transferred the charge of the public accounts 
from these officers to the commissioners.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>The arrangement of this business had been variously and 
frequently altered. <name type="person">Augustus</name> allowed the Senate to appoint commissioners; 
then, when corrupt practices were suspected in the voting; men were chosen 
by lot for the office out of the whole number of pr&aelig;tors. This did not 
last long, as the lot strayed away to unfit persons. <name type="person">Claudius</name> then again 
appointed qu&aelig;stors, and that they might not be too lax in their duties 
from fear of offending, he promised them promotion out of the usual course. 
But what they lacked was the firmness of mature age, entering, as they did, 
on this office as their first step, and so <name type="person">Nero</name> appointed ex-pr&aelig;tors 
of approved competency.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>During the 
same consulship, <name type="person">Vipsanius L&aelig;nas</name> was condemned for rapacity in his 
administration of the province of <rs type="placename">Sardinia</rs>. <name type="person">Cestius 
Proculus</name> was acquitted of extortion, his accusers dropping the charge. 
<name type="person">Clodius Quirinalis</name>, having, when in command of the crews at <rs type="placename">Ravenna</rs>, caused grievous distress to <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> by his profligacy and cruelty, just as if it was 
the most contemptible of countries, forestalled his doom by poison. <name type="person">Caninius 
Rebilus</name>, one of the first men in legal knowledge and vastness of wealth, 
escaped the miseries of an old age of broken health by letting the blood 
trickle from his veins, though men did not credit him with sufficient 
resolution for a self-inflicted death, because of his infamous effeminacy. 
<name type="person">Lucius Volusius</name> on the other hand died with a glorious name. There was his 
long life of ninety-three

years, his conspicuous wealth, 
honourably acquired, and his wise avoidance of the malignity of so many 
emperors.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>During <name type="person">Nero</name>'s second 
consulship with <name type="person">Lucius Piso</name> for his colleague, little occurred deserving 
mention, unless one were to take pleasure in filling volumes with the praise 
of the foundations and timber work on which the emperor piled the immense 
amphitheatre in the <rs type="placename">Field of Mars</rs>. But we have learnt that it suits the 
dignity of the Roman people to reserve history for great achievements, and 
to leave such details to the city's daily register. I may mention that the 
colonies of <rs type="placename">Nuceria</rs> and <rs type="placename">Capua</rs> were strengthened by an addition of veterans; to 
every member of the city populace four hundred sesterces were given, and 
forty million paid into the exchequer to maintain the credit of the 
citizens. </p>
<p>A tax also of four per cent. on the sale of slaves was 
remitted, an apparent more than a real boon, for as the seller was ordered 
to pay it, purchasers found that it was added as part of the price. The 
emperor by an edict forbade any magistrate or procurator in the government 
of a province to exhibit a show of gladiators, or of wild beasts, or indeed 
any other public entertainment; for hitherto our subjects had been as much 
oppressed by such bribery as by actual extortion, while governors sought to 
screen by corruption the guilty deeds of arbitrary caprice.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>The Senate next passed a decree, providing alike 
for punishment and safety. If a master were murdered by his slaves, all 
those who were enfranchised by his will and lived under the same roof, were 
to suffer the capital punishment with his other slaves. Lucius Varius, an 
ex-consul, who had been crushed in the past under charges of extortion, was 
restored to his rank as a senator. <name type="person">Pomponia Gr&aelig;cina</name>, a distinguished 
lady, wife of the <name type="person">Plautius</name> who returned from <rs type="placename">Britain</rs> 
with an ovation, was accused of some foreign superstition and handed over to 
her husband's judicial decision. Following ancient precedent, he heard his 
wife's cause in the presence of kinsfolk, involving, as it did, her legal 
status and character, and he reported that she was innocent. This <name type="person">Pomponia</name> 
lived a long life of unbroken melancholy. After the murder of <name type="person">Julia</name>, 
<name type="person">Drusus</name>'s daughter, by <name type="person">Messalina</name>'s treachery, for forty years she wore only 
the attire of a mourner,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SLAVE LEGISLATION;

with a heart ever sorrowful. For this, during <name type="person">Claudius</name>' 
reign, she escaped unpunished, and it was afterwards counted a glory to 
her.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>The same year saw many 
impeached. One of these, <name type="person">Publius Celer</name>, prosecuted by the province of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, the emperor could not acquit, and so he put off 
the case till the man died of old age. <name type="person">Celer</name>, as I have related, had 
murdered <name type="person">Silanus</name>, the pro-consul, and the magnitude of this crime veiled his 
other enormities. <name type="person">Cossutianus Capito</name> was accused by the people of <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs>; he was a man stained with the foulest guilt, 
and had actually imagined that his audacious wickedness had the same rights 
in a province as he had claimed for it at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. But 
he had to confront a determined prosecution, and at last abandoned his 
defence. <name type="person">Eprius Marcellus</name>, from whom <name type="person">Lycia</name> demanded compensation, was so 
powerfully supported by corrupt influence that some of his accusers were 
punished with exile, as though they had imperilled an innocent man.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> entered on his third consulship with 
<name type="person">Valerius Messala</name>, whose great-grandfather, the orator <name type="person">Corvinus</name>, was still 
remembered by a few old men, as having been the colleague of the Divine 
<name type="person">Augustus</name>, <name type="person">Nero</name>'s great-grandfather, in the same office. But the honour of a 
noble house was further increased by an annual grant of five hundred 
thousand sesterces on which <name type="person">Messala</name> might support virtuous poverty. <name type="person">Aurelius 
Cotta</name>, too, and <name type="person">Haterius Antonius</name> had yearly stipends assigned them by the 
emperor, though they had squandered their ancestral wealth in profligacy. 
</p>
<p>Early in this year a war between <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> about the possession of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, which, feebly begun, had hitherto dragged on, 
was vigorously resumed. For <name type="person">Vologeses</name> would not allow his brother <name type="person">Tiridates</name> 
to be deprived of a kingdom which he had himself given him, or to hold it as 
a gift from a foreign power, and <name type="person">Corbulo</name> too thought it due to the grandeur 
of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> that he should recover what <name type="person">Lucullus</name> and 
<name type="person">Pompeius</name> had formerly won. Besides, the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> in the fluctuations of 
their allegiance sought the armed protection of both empires, though by 
their country's position, by resemblance of manners, and by the ties of 
intermarriage, they were more connected with the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, to whose 
sub-

jection, in their ignorance of freedom, they rather 
inclined.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name> however had more to 
struggle against in the supineness of his soldiers than in the treachery of 
the enemy. His legions indeed, transferred as they had been from <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> and demoralised by a long peace, endured most 
impatiently the duties of a Roman camp. It was well known that that army 
contained veterans who had never been on piquet duty or on night guard, to 
whom the rampart and the fosse were new and strange sights, men without 
helmets or breast-plates, sleek money-making traders, who had served all 
their time in towns. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> having discharged all who were old or in 
ill-health, sought to supply their places, and levies were held in <rs type="placename">Galatia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs>, and to 
these were added a legion from <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> with its 
auxiliary cavalry and light infantry. The entire army was kept under canvas, 
though the winter was so severe that the ground, covered as it was with ice, 
did not yield a place for the tents without being dug up. Many of the men 
had their limbs frost-bitten through the intensity of the cold, and some 
perished on guard. A soldier was observed whose hands mortified as he was 
carrying a bundle of wood, so that sticking to their burden they dropped off 
from his arms, now mere stumps. The general, lightly clad, with head 
uncovered, was continually with his men on the march, amid their labours; he 
had praise for the brave, comfort for the feeble, and was a good example to 
all. And then as many shrank from the rigour of the climate and of the 
service, and deserted, he sought a remedy in strictness of discipline. Not, 
as in other armies, was a first or second offense condoned, but the soldier, 
who had quitted his colours, instantly paid the penalty with his life. This 
was shown by experience to be a wholesome measure, better than mercy; for 
there were fewer desertions in that camp than in those in which leniency was 
habitual.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>Meanwhile <name type="person">Corbulo</name> kept his 
legions within the camp till spring weather was fairly established, and 
having stationed his auxiliary infantry at suitable points, he directed them 
not to begin an engagement. The charge of these defensive positions he 
entrusted to <name type="person">Paccius Orfitus</name>, who had held the post of a first-rank 
centurion. Though this officer

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">WAR WITH <rs type="placename">PARTHIA</rs></note>
had reported that the barbarians were 
heedless, and that an opportunity for success presented itself, he was 
instructed to keep within his entrenchments and to wait for a stronger 
force. But he broke the order, and on the arrival of a few cavalry squadrons 
from the nearest forts, who in their inexperience insisted on fighting, he 
engaged the enemy and was routed. Panic-stricken by his disaster, those who 
ought to have given him support returned in precipitate flight to their 
respective encampments. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> heard of this with displeasure; he sharply 
censured <name type="person">Paccius</name>, the officers and soldiers, and ordered them to have their 
quarters outside the lines. There they were kept in disgrace, and were 
released only on the intercession of the whole army.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p><name type="person">Tiridates</name> meantime who, besides his own 
dependencies, had the powerful aid of his brother <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, ravaged <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, not in stealthy raids as before, but in open 
war, plundering all whom he thought loyal to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, 
while he eluded an action with any force which was brought against him, and 
thus flying hither and thither, he spread panic more widely by rumour than 
by arms. So <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, frustrated in his prolonged efforts to bring on an 
engagement and compelled, like the enemy, to carry hostilities everywhere, 
divided his army, so that his generals and officers might attack several 
points simultaneously. He at the same time instructed king <name type="person">Antiochus</name> to 
hasten to the provinces on his frontier, as <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, after having slain 
his son <name type="person">Rhadamistus</name> as a traitor to prove his loyalty to us, was following 
up more keenly than ever his old feud with the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name>. Then, for the 
first time, we won the friendship of the <name type="ethnic">Moschi</name>, a nation which became 
pre-eminently attached to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and they overran the 
wilds of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>. Thus the intended plans of 
<name type="person">Tiridates</name> were wholly reversed, and he sent envoys to ask on behalf of 
himself and of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, why, when hostages had lately been given and a 
friendship renewed which might open up a way to further acts of goodwill, he 
was thus driven from <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, his ancient 
possession. "As yet," he said, "<name type="person">Vologeses</name> had not bestirred himself, simply 
because they preferred negotiation to violence. Should however war be 
persisted in, the Arsacids would not want the courage and good fortune which 
had already been

proved more than once by disaster to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>." <name type="person">Corbulo</name> in reply, when he was certain that 
<name type="person">Vologeses</name> was detained by the revolt of <rs type="placename">Hyrcania</rs>, 
advised <name type="person">Tiridates</name> to address a petition to the emperor, assuring him that he 
might reign securely and without bloodshed by relinquishing a prospect in 
the remote future for the sake of one more solid within his reach.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>As no progress was made towards a final 
settlement of peace by the interchange of messages, it was at last decided 
to fix a time and a place for an interview between the leaders. "A thousand 
troopers," <name type="person">Tiridates</name> said, "would be his escort; what force of every kind 
was to be with <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, he did not prescribe, provided they came in peaceful 
fashion, without breast-plates and helmets." Any human being, to say nothing 
of an old and wary general, would have seen through the barbarian's cunning, 
which assigned a limited number on one side and offered a larger on the 
other, expressly with a treacherous intent; for, were they to be exposed to 
a cavalry trained in the use of arrows, with the person undefended, numbers 
would be unavailing. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> however, pretending not to understand this, 
replied that they would do better to discuss matters requiring consideration 
for their common good, in the presence of the entire armies, and he selected 
a place partly consisting of gently sloping hills, suited for ranks of 
infantry, partly, of a spreading plain where troops of cavalry could 
man&oelig;uvre. On the appointed day, arriving first, he posted his allied 
infantry with the king's auxiliaries on the wings, the sixth legion in the 
centre, with which he had united three thousand men of the third, brought up 
in the night from another camp, with one eagle, so as to look like a single 
legion. <name type="person">Tiridates</name> towards evening showed himself at some distance, whence he 
could be seen rather than heard. And so the Roman general, without any 
conference, ordered his troops to retire to their respective camps.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>The king either suspecting a stratagem from 
these simultaneous movements in different directions, or intending to cut 
off our supplies as they were coming up from the sea of <rs type="placename">Pontus</rs> and the town of <rs type="placename">Trapezus</rs>, 
hastily withdrew. He could not however make any attack on the supplies, as 
they

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CORBULO OVERCOMES GUILE AND FORCE</note>
were brought 
over mountains in the occupation of our forces. <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, that war might not 
be uselessly protracted, and also to compel the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> to defend their 
possessions, prepared to destroy their fortresses, himself undertaking the 
assault on the strongest of all in that province named <rs type="placename">Volandum</rs>. The weaker he assigned to <name type="person">Cornelius Flaccus</name>, 
his lieutenant, and to <name type="person">Insteius Capito</name>, his camp-prefect. Having then 
surveyed the defences and provided everything suitable for storming them, he 
exhorted his soldiers to strip of his home this vagabond foe who was 
preparing neither for peace nor for war, but who confessed his treachery and 
cowardice by flight, and so to secure alike glory and spoil. Then forming 
his army into four divisions, he led one in the dense array of the "testudo" 
close up to the rampart, to undermine it, while others were ordered to apply 
scaling ladders to the walls, and many more were to discharge brands and 
javelins from engines. The slingers and artillerymen had a position assigned 
them from which to hurl their missiles at a distance, so that, with equal 
tumult everywhere, no support might be given from any point to such as were 
pressed. So impetuous were the efforts of the army that within a third part 
of one day the walls were stripped of their defenders, the barriers of the 
gates overthrown, the fortifications scaled and captured, and all the adult 
inhabitants massacred, without the loss of a soldier and with but very few 
wounded. The non-military population were sold by auction; the rest of the 
booty fell to the conquerors. </p>
<p><name type="person">Corbulo</name>'s lieutenant and camp-prefect met 
with similar success; three forts were stormed by them in one day, and the 
remainder, some from panic, others by the consent of the occupants, 
capitulated. This inspired them with confidence to attack the capital of the 
country, <rs type="placename">Artaxata</rs>. The legions however were not 
marched by the nearest route, for should they cross the river <rs type="placename">Avaxes</rs> which washes the city's walls by a bridge, they 
would be within missile-range. They passed over it at a distance, where it 
was broad and shallow.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>Meantime 
<name type="person">Tiridates</name>, ashamed of seeming utterly powerless by not interfering with the 
siege, and afraid that, in attempting to stop it, he would entangle himself 
and his cavalry on difficult ground, resolved finally to display his 
forces

and either give battle on the first opportunity, or, by a 
pretended flight, prepare the way for some stratagem. Suddenly, he threw 
himself on the Roman columns, without however surprising our general, who 
had formed his army for fighting as well as for marching. On the right and 
left flanks marched the third and sixth legions, with some picked men of the 
tenth in the centre; the baggage was secured within the lines, and the rear 
was guarded by a thousand cavalry, who were ordered to resist any close 
attack of the enemy, but not to pursue his retreat. On the wings were the 
foot-archers and the remainder of the cavalry, with a more extended line on 
the left wing, along the base of some hills, so that should the enemy 
penetrate the centre, he might be encountered both in front and flank. 
<name type="person">Tiridates</name> faced us in skirmishing order, but not within missile-range, now 
threatening attack, now seemingly afraid, with the view of loosening our 
formation and falling on isolated divisions. Finding that there was no 
breaking of our ranks from rashness, and that only one cavalry officer 
advanced too boldly, and that he falling pierced with arrows, confirmed the 
rest in obedience by the warning, he retired on the approach of 
darkness.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name> then encamped on the 
spot, and considered whether he should push on his legions without their 
baggage to <rs type="placename">Artaxata</rs> and blockade the city, on which, 
he supposed, <name type="person">Tiridates</name> had fallen back. When his scouts reported that the 
king had undertaken a long march, and that it was doubtful whether <rs type="placename">Media</rs> or <rs type="placename">Albania</rs> was its 
destination, he waited for daylight, and then sent on his light-armed 
troops, which were meanwhile to hover round the walls and begin the attack 
from a distance. The inhabitants however opened the gates of their own 
accord, and surrendered themselves and their property to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. This 
saved their lives; the city was fired, demolished and levelled to the 
ground, as it could not be held without a strong garrison from the extent of 
the walls, and we had not sufficient force to be divided between adequately 
garrisoning it and carrying on the war. If again the place were left 
untouched and unguarded, no advantage or glory would accrue from its 
capture. Then too there was a wonderful occurrence, almost a divine 
interposition. While the whole space outside the town, up to its build-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><rs type="placename">ARTAXATA</rs> DESTROYED</note>
ings, was 
bright with sunlight, the enclosure within the walls was suddenly shrouded 
in a black cloud, seamed with lightning-flashes, and thus the city was 
thought to be given up to destruction, as if heaven was wroth against it. 
</p>
<p>For all this <name type="person">Nero</name> was unanimously saluted emperor, and by the Senate's 
decree a thanksgiving was held; statues also, arches and successive 
consulships were voted to him, and among the holy days were to be included 
the day on which the victory was won, that on which it was announced, and 
that on which the motion was brought forward. Other proposals too of a like 
kind were carried, on a scale so extravagant, that <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name>, after 
having assented to the rest of the honours, argued that if the gods were to 
be thanked for the bountiful favours of fortune, even a whole year would not 
suffice for thanksgivings, and therefore there ought to be a classification 
of sacred and business-days, that so they might observe divine ordinances 
and yet not interfere with human affairs.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>A man who had struggled with various calamities and earned the 
hate of many, was then impeached and condemned, but not without angry 
feelings towards <name type="person">Seneca</name>. This was <name type="person">Publius Suilius</name>. He had been terrible and 
venal, while <name type="person">Claudius</name> reigned, and when times were changed, he was not so 
much humbled as his enemies wished, and was one who would rather seem a 
criminal than a suppliant. With the intent of crushing him, so men believed, 
a decree of the Senate was revived, along with the penalty of the Cincian 
law against persons who had pleaded for hire. <name type="person">Suilius</name> spared not complaint 
or indignant remonstrance; freespoken because of his extreme age as well as 
from his insolent temper, he taunted <name type="person">Seneca</name> with his savage enmity against 
the friends of <name type="person">Claudius</name>, under whose reign he had endured a most righteously 
deserved exile. "The man," he said, "familiar as he was only with profitless 
studies, and with the ignorance of boyhood, envied those who employed a 
lively and genuine eloquence in the defence of their fellow-citizens. 
<emph>He</emph> had been <name type="person">Germanicus</name>'s qu&aelig;stor, while <name type="person">Seneca</name> had been a 
paramour in his house. Was it to be thought a worse offence to obtain a 
reward for honest service with the litigant's consent, than to pollute the 
chamber, of the imperial ladies? By what kind

of wisdom or maxims 
of philosophy had <name type="person">Seneca</name> within four years of royal favour amassed three 
hundred million sesterces? At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> the wills of the 
childless were, so to say, caught in his snare while <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> and the provinces were drained by a boundless 
usury. His own money, on the other hand, had been acquired by industry and 
was not excessive. He would suffer prosecutions, perils, anything indeed 
rather than make an old and self-earned position of honour to bow before an 
upstart prosperity."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>Persons were not 
wanting to report all this to <name type="person">Seneca</name>, in the exact words, or with a worse 
sense put on it. Accusers were also found who alleged that our allies had 
been plundered, when <name type="person">Suilius</name> governed the province of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, and that there had been embezzlement of public 
monies. Then, as an entire year had been granted to them for inquiries, it 
seemed a shorter plan to begin with his crimes at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, the witnesses of which were on the spot. These men 
charged <name type="person">Suilius</name> with having driven <name type="person">Quintus Pomponius</name> by a relentless 
prosecution into the extremity of civil war, with having forced <name type="person">Julia</name>, 
<name type="person">Drusus</name>'s daughter, and <name type="person">Sabina Popp&aelig;a</name> to suicide, with having 
treacherously ruined <name type="person">Valerius Asiaticus</name>, <name type="person">Lusius Saturninus</name> and <name type="person">Cornelius 
Lupus</name>, in fact, with the wholesale conviction of troops of Roman knights, 
and with all the cruelty of <name type="person">Claudius</name>. His defence was that of all this he 
had done nothing on his own responsibility but had simply obeyed the 
emperor, till <name type="person">Nero</name> stopped such pleadings, by stating that he had 
ascertained from his father's note-books that he had never compelled the 
prosecution of a single person. </p>
<p><name type="person">Suilius</name> then sheltered himself under 
<name type="person">Messalina</name>'s orders, and the defence began to collapse. "Why," it was asked, 
"was no one else chosen to put his tongue at the service of that savage 
harlot? We must punish the instruments of atrocious acts, when, having 
gained the rewards of wickedness, they impute the wickedness to others." 
</p>
<p>And so, with the loss of half his property, his son and granddaughter 
being allowed to retain the other half, and what they had inherited under 
their mother's or grandmother's will being also exempted from confiscation, 
<name type="person">Suilius</name> was banished to the <rs type="placename">Balearic isles</rs>. Neither in the crisis of his

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CONDEMNATION OF SUILIUS</note>
peril nor after his condemnation 
did he quail in spirit. Rumour said that he supported that lonely exile by a 
life of ease and plenty. When the accusers attacked his son <name type="person">Nerullinus</name> on 
the strength of men's hatred of the father and of some charges of extortion, 
the emperor interposed, as if implying that vengeance was fully 
satisfied.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>About the same time 
<name type="person">Octavius Sagitta</name>, a tribune of the people, who was enamoured to frenzy of 
<name type="person">Pontia</name>, a married woman, bribed her by most costly presents into an intrigue 
and then into abandoning her husband. He had offered her marriage and had 
won her consent. But as soon as she was free, she devised delays, pretended 
that her father's wishes were against it, and having secured the prospect of 
a richer husband, she repudiated her promises. <name type="person">Octavius</name>, on the other hand, 
now remonstrated, now threatened; his good name, he protested, was lost, his 
means exhausted, and as for his life, which was all that was left to him, he 
surrendered it to her mercy. When she spurned him, he asked the solace of 
one night, with which to soothe his passion, that he might set bounds to it 
for the future. A night was fixed, and <name type="person">Pontia</name> intrusted the charge of her 
chamber to a female slave acquainted with her secret. <name type="person">Octavius</name> attended by 
one freedman entered, with a dagger concealed under his dress. Then, as 
usual in lovers' quarrels, there were chidings, entreaties, reproaches, 
excuses, and some period of the darkness was given up to passion; then, when 
seemingly about to go, and she was fearing nothing, he stabbed her with the 
steel, and having wounded and scared away the slave girl who was hurrying to 
her, rushed out of the chamber. Next day the murder was notorious, and there 
was no question as to the murderer, for it was proved that he had passed 
some time with her. The freedman, however, declared the deed was his, that 
he had, in fact, avenged his patron's wrongs. He had made some impression by 
the nobleness of his example, when the slave girl recovered and revealed the 
truth. <name type="person">Octavius</name>, when he ceased to be tribune, was prosecuted before the 
consuls by the father of the murdered woman, and was condemned by the 
sentence of the Senate under "the law concerning assassins."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>A profligacy equally notorious in that same 
year

proved the beginning of great evils to the State. There was 
at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> one <name type="person">Sabina Popp&aelig;a</name>; her father was 
<name type="person">Titus Ollius</name>, but she had assumed the name of her maternal grandfather 
<name type="person">Popp&aelig;us Sabinus</name>, a man of illustrious memory and pre-eminently 
distinguished by the honours of a consulship and a triumph. As for <name type="person">Ollius</name>, 
before he attained promotion, the friendship of <name type="person">Sejanus</name> was his ruin. This 
<name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> had everything but a right mind. Her mother, who surpassed in 
personal attractions all the ladies of her day, had bequeathed to her alike 
fame and beauty. Her fortune adequately corresponded to the nobility of her 
descent. Her conversation was charming and her wit anything but dull. She 
professed virtue, while she practised laxity. Seldom did she appear in 
public, and it was always with her face partly veiled, either to disappoint 
men's gaze or to set off her beauty. Her character she never spared, making 
no distinction between a husband and a paramour, while she was never a slave 
to her own passion or to that of her lover. Wherever there was a prospect of 
advantage, there she transferred her favours. And so while she was living as 
the wife of <name type="person">Rufius Crispinus</name>, a Roman knight, by whom she had a son, she was 
attracted by the youth and fashionable elegance of <name type="person">Otho</name>, and by the fact too 
that he was reputed to have <name type="person">Nero</name>'s most ardent friendship. Without any delay 
the intrigue was followed by marriage.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p><name type="person">Otho</name> now began to praise his wife's beauty and accomplishments to the 
emperor, either from a lover's thoughtlessness or to inflame <name type="person">Nero</name>'s passion, 
in the hope of adding to his own influence by the further tie which would 
arise out of possession of the same woman. Often, as he rose from the 
emperor's table, was he heard repeatedly to say that he was going to her, to 
the high birth and beauty which had fallen to his lot, to that which all men 
pray for, the joy of the fortunate. These and like incitements allowed but 
of brief delay. Once having gained admission, <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> won her way by 
artful blandishments, pretending that she could not resist her passion and 
that she was captivated by <name type="person">Nero</name>'s person. Soon, as the emperor's love grew 
ardent, she would change and be supercilious, and, if she were detained more 
than one or two nights, would say again and again that she

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO LOVES POPP&AElig;A, WIFE OF OTHO</note>
was a married 
woman and could not give up her husband attached as she was to <name type="person">Otho</name> by a 
manner of life, which no one equalled. "His ideas and his style were grand; 
at his house everything worthy of the highest fortune was ever before her 
eyes. <name type="person">Nero</name>, on the contrary, with his slave girl mistress, tied down by his 
attachment to <name type="person">Acte</name>, had derived nothing from his slavish associations but 
what was low and degrading." </p>
<p><name type="person">Otho</name> was now cut off from <name type="person">Nero</name>'s usual 
familiar intercourse, and then even from interviews and from the royal 
suite, and at last was appointed governor of the province of <rs type="placename">Lusitania</rs>, that he might not be the emperor's rival at 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. There he lived up to the time of the civil 
wars, not in the fashion of his disgraceful past, but uprightly and 
virtuously, a pleasure-loving man when idle, and self-restrained when in 
power.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>Hitherto <name type="person">Nero</name> had sought a 
veil for his abominations and wickedness. He was particularly suspicious of 
<name type="person">Cornelius Sulla</name>, whose apathetic temper he interpreted as really the 
reverse, inferring that he was, in fact, an artful dissembler. <name type="person">Graptus</name>, one 
of the emperor's freedmen, whose age and experience had made him thoroughly 
acquainted with the imperial household from the time of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, quickened 
these apprehensions by the following falsehood. The <rs type="placename">Mulvian bridge</rs> was then 
a famous haunt of nightly profligacy, and <name type="person">Nero</name> used to go there that he 
might take his pleasures more freely outside the city. So <name type="person">Graptus</name>, taking 
advantage of an idle panic into which the royal attendants had chanced to 
have been thrown on their return by one of those youthful frolics which were 
then everywhere practised, invented a story that a treacherous attack had 
been planned on the emperor, should he go back by the <rs type="placename">Flaminian road</rs>, and 
that through the favour of destiny he had escaped it, as he went home by a 
different way to <rs type="placename">Sallust's gardens</rs>. <name type="person">Sulla</name>, he said, was the author of this 
plot. Not one, however, of <name type="person">Sulla</name>'s slaves or clients was recognised, and his 
character, despicable as it was and incapable of a daring act, was utterly 
at variance with the charge. Still, just as if he had been found guilty, he 
was ordered to leave his country, and confine himself within the walls of 
<rs type="placename">Massilia</rs>.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>During the same consulship a hearing was given to two 
conflicting deputations from <rs type="placename">Puteoli</rs>, sent to the 
Senate by the town council and by the populace. The first spoke bitterly of 
the violence of the multitude; the second, of the rapacity of the 
magistrates and of all the chief citizens. That the disturbance, which had 
gone as far as stoning and threats of fire, might not lead on to bloodshed 
and armed fighting, <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name> was appointed to apply some remedy. As 
they would not endure his rigour, the charge of the affair was at his own 
request transferred to the brothers Scribonii, to whom was given a 
pr&aelig;torian cohort, the terror of which, coupled with the execution of a 
few persons, restored peace to the townspeople.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>I should not mention a very trivial decree of the Senate which 
allowed the city of <rs type="placename">Syracuse </rs>to exceed the 
prescribed number in their gladiatorial shows, had not <name type="person">P&aelig;tus Thrasea</name> 
spoken against it and furnished his traducers with a ground for censuring 
his motion. "Why," it was asked, "if he thought that the public welfare 
required freedom of speech in the Senate, did he pursue such trifling 
abuses? Why should he not speak for or against peace and war, or on the 
taxes and laws and other matters involving Roman interests? The senators, as 
often as they received the privilege of stating an opinion, were at liberty 
to say out what they pleased, and to claim that it should be put to the 
vote. Was it the only worthy object of reform to provide that the <name type="ethnic">Syracusans</name> 
should not give shows on a larger scale? Were all other matters in every 
department of the empire as admirable as if <name type="person">Thrasea</name> and not <name type="person">Nero</name> had the 
direction of them? But if the highest affairs were passed by and ignored, 
how much more ought there to be no meddling with things wholly 
insignificant." </p>
<p><name type="person">Thrasea</name> in reply, when his friends asked an explanation, 
said "that it was not in ignorance of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s actual condition that he sought 
to correct such decrees, but that he was giving what was due to the honour 
of the senators, in making it evident that those who attended even to the 
merest trifles, would not disguise their responsibility for important 
affairs."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>That same year, repeated 
demands on the part of the people, who denounced the excessive greed of the

collectors, made <name type="person">Nero</name> doubt 
whether he should not order the repeal of all indirect taxes, and so confer 
a most splendid boon on the human race. But this sudden impulse was checked 
by the senators, who, having first heartily praised the grandeur of his 
conception, pointed out "that the dissolution of the empire must ensue if 
the revenues which supported the State were to be diminished; for as soon as 
the customs were swept away, there would follow a demand for the abolition 
of the direct taxes. Many companies for the collection of the indirect taxes 
had been formed by consuls and tribunes, when the freedom of the Roman 
people was still in its vigour, and arrangements were subsequently made to 
insure an exact correspondence between the amount of income and the 
necessary disbursements. Certainly some restraint, they admitted, must be 
put on the cupidity of the revenue collectors, that they might not by new 
oppressions bring into odium what for so many years had been endured without 
a complaint."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>Accordingly the emperor 
issued an edict that the regulations about every branch of the public 
revenue, which had hitherto been kept secret, should be published; that 
claims which had been dropped should not be revived after a year; that the 
pr&aelig;tor at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, the propr&aelig;tor or 
proconsul in the provinces, should give judicial precedence to all cases 
against the collectors; that the soldiers should retain their immunities 
except when they traded for profit, with other very equitable arrangements, 
which for a short time were maintained and were subsequently disregarded. 
However, the repeal of the two per cent. and two-and-a-half per cent. taxes 
remains in force, as well as that of others bearing names invented by the 
collectors to cover their illegal exactions. In our transmarine provinces 
the conveyance of corn was rendered less costly, and it was decided that 
merchant ships should not be assessed with their owner's property, and that 
no tax should be paid on them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>Two 
men under prosecution from <rs type="placename">Africa</rs>, in which province 
they had held proconsular authority, <name type="person">Sulpicius Camerinus</name> and <name type="person">Pomponius 
Silvanus</name>, were acquitted by the emperor. <name type="person">Camerinus</name> had against him a few 
private persons who charged him with cruelty rather than with extortion.

<name type="person">Silvanus</name> was beset by a host of accusers, who demanded time for 
summoning their witnesses, while the defendant insisted on being at once put 
on his defence. And he was successful, through his wealth, his 
childlessness, and his old age, which he prolonged beyond the life of those 
by whose corrupt influence he had escaped.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>Up to this time everything had been quiet in <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>, from the temper of the generals, who, now that 
triumphal decorations had been vulgarised, hoped for greater glory by the 
maintenance of peace. <name type="person">Paulinus Pompeius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Vetus</name> were then in 
command of the army. Still, to avoid keeping the soldiers in idleness, the 
first completed the embankment begun sixty-three years before by <name type="person">Drusus</name> to 
confine the waters of the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, while <name type="person">Vetus</name> 
prepared to connect the <rs type="placename">Moselle</rs> and the <rs type="placename">Arar</rs> by a canal, so that troops crossing the sea and 
then conveyed on the <rs type="placename">Rhone</rs> and <rs type="placename">Arar</rs> might sail by this canal into the <rs type="placename">Moselle</rs> and the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs>, and 
thence to the ocean. Thus the difficulties of the route being removed, there 
would be communication for ships between the shores of the west and of the 
north. </p>
<p><name type="person">&AElig;lius Gracilis</name>, the governor of <rs type="placename">Belgica</rs>, discouraged the work by seeking to deter <name type="person">Vetus</name> 
from bringing his legions into another man's province, and so drawing to 
himself the attachment of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>. This result he repeatedly said would excite 
the fears of the emperor, an assertion by which meritorious undertakings are 
often hindered.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>Meantime, from the 
continued inaction of our armies, a rumour prevailed that the commanders had 
been deprived of the right of leading them against the enemy. Thereupon the 
<name type="ethnic">Frisii</name> moved up their youth to the forests and swamps, and their 
non-fighting population, over the lakes, to the river-bank, and established 
themselves in unoccupied lands, reserved for the use of our soldiers, under 
the leadership of <name type="person">Verritus</name> and <name type="person">Malorix</name>, the kings of the tribe, as far as 
<name type="ethnic">Germans</name> are under kings. Already they had settled themselves in houses, had 
sown the fields, and were cultivating the soil as if it had been their 
ancestors', when <name type="person">Dubius Avitus</name>, who had succeeded <name type="person">Paulinus</name> in the province, 
by threatening them with a Roman attack if they did not retire into their 
old country or obtain a new territory from the emperor, con-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GERMAN AMBASSADORS IN <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note>
strained <name type="person">Verritus</name> and <name type="person">Malorix</name> to become 
suppliants. They went to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and while they waited 
for <name type="person">Nero</name>, who was intent on other engagements, among the sights shown to the 
barbarians they were admitted into <rs type="placename">Pompey's theatre</rs>, where they might behold 
the vastness of the Roman people. There at their leisure (for in the 
entertainment, ignorant as they were, they found no amusement) they asked 
questions about the crowd on the benches, about the distinctions of classes, 
who were the knights, where was the Senate, till they observed some persons 
in a foreign dress on the seats of the senators. Having asked who they were, 
when they were told that this honour was granted to envoys from those 
nations which were distinguished for their bravery and their friendship to 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, they exclaimed that no men on earth surpassed 
the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> in arms or in loyalty. Then they went down and took their seat 
among the senators. The spectators hailed the act goodnaturedly, as due to 
the impulsiveness of a primitive people and to an honourable rivalry. <name type="person">Nero</name> 
gave both of them the Roman franchise, and ordered the <name type="ethnic">Frisii</name> to withdraw 
from the territory in question. When they disdained obedience, some 
auxiliary cavalry by a sudden attack made it a necessity for them, capturing 
or slaughtering those who obstinately resisted.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>Of this same territory, the <name type="ethnic">Ampsivarii</name> now possessed themselves, 
a tribe more powerful not only from their numbers, but from having the 
sympathy of the neighbouring peoples, as they had been expelled by the 
<name type="ethnic">Chauci</name> and had to beg, as homeless outcasts, a secure exile. Their cause was 
pleaded by a man, famous among those nations and loyal to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, <name type="person">Boiocalus</name> by name, who reminded us that on the 
Cheruscan revolt he had been imprisoned by the order of <name type="person">Arminius</name>, that 
afterwards he had served under the leadership of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> and of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, 
and that to a fifty years' obedience he was adding the merit of subjecting 
his tribe to our dominion. "What an extent of plain," he would say, "lies 
open into which the flocks and herds of the Roman soldiers may some day be 
sent! Let them by all means keep retreats for their cattle, while men are 
starving; only let them not prefer a waste and a solitude to friendly 
nations. Once these fields belonged to the <name type="ethnic">Chamavi</name>; then to

the 
<name type="ethnic">Tubantes</name>; after them to the <name type="ethnic">Usipii</name>. As heaven is for the gods, so the earth 
has been given to mankind, and lands uninhabited are common to all." Then 
looking up to the sun and invoking the other heavenly bodies, he asked them, 
as though standing in their presence, "whether they wished to behold an 
empty soil; rather let them submerge it beneath the sea against the 
plunderers of the land."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p><name type="person">Avitus</name> was 
impressed by this language and said that people must submit to the rule of 
their betters; that the gods to whom they appealed, had willed that the 
decision as to what should be given or taken from them, was to rest with the 
<name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, who would allow none but themselves to be judges. This was his 
public answer to the <name type="ethnic">Ampsivarii</name>; to <name type="person">Boiocalus</name> his reply was that in 
remembrance of past friendship he would cede the lands in question. 
<name type="person">Boiocalus</name> spurned the offer as the price of treason, adding, "We may lack a 
land to live in; we cannot lack one to die in." And so they parted with 
mutual exasperation. The <name type="ethnic">Ampsivarii</name> now called on the <name type="ethnic">Bructeri</name>, the 
<name type="ethnic">Tencteri</name>, and yet more distant tribes to be their allies in war. <name type="person">Avitus</name>, 
having written to <name type="person">Curtilius Mancia</name>, commander of the Upper army, asking him 
to cross the <rs type="placename">Rhine</rs> and display his troops in the 
enemy's rear, himself led his legions into the territory of the <name type="ethnic">Tencteri</name>, 
and threatened them with extermination unless they dissociated themselves 
from the cause. When upon this the <name type="ethnic">Tencteri</name> stood aloof, the <name type="ethnic">Bructeri</name> were 
cowed by a like terror. And so, as the rest too were for averting perils 
which did not concern them, the Ampsivarian tribe in its isolation retreated 
to the <name type="ethnic">Usipii</name> and <name type="ethnic">Tubantes</name>. Driven out of these countries, they sought 
refuge with the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name> and then with the <name type="ethnic">Cherusci</name>, and after long 
wanderings, as destitute outcasts, received now as friends now as foes, 
their entire youth were slain in a strange land, and all who could not 
fight, were apportioned as booty.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>The 
same summer a great battle was fought between the <name type="ethnic">Hermunduri</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name>, 
both forcibly claiming a river which produced salt in plenty, and bounded 
their territories. They had not only a passion for settling every question 
by arms, but also a deep-rooted superstition that such localities are 
specially near to heaven, and that mortal pray-

WAR IN <rs type="placename">GERMANY</rs></note>
ers are nowhere more 
attentively heard by the gods. It is, they think, through the bounty of 
divine power, that in that river and in those forests salt is produced, not, 
as in other countries, by the drying up of an overflow of the sea, but by 
the combination of two opposite elements, fire and water, when the latter 
had been poured over a burning pile of wood. The war was a success for the 
<name type="ethnic">Hermunduri</name>, and the more disastrous to the <name type="ethnic">Chatti</name> because they had devoted, 
in the event of victory, the enemy's army to <name type="person">Mars</name> and <name type="person">Mercury</name>, a vow which 
consigns horses, men, everything indeed on the vanquished side to 
destruction. And so the hostile threat recoiled on themselves. Meanwhile, a 
state in alliance with us, that of the <name type="ethnic">Ubii</name>, suffered grievously from an 
unexpected calamity. Fires suddenly bursting from the earth seized 
everywhere on country houses, crops, and villages, and were rushing on to 
the very walls of the newly founded colony. Nor could they be extinguished 
by the fall of rain, or by river-water, or by any other moisture, till some 
countrymen, in despair of a remedy and in fury at the disaster, flung stones 
from a distance, and then, approaching nearer, as the flames began to sink, 
tried to scare them away, like so many wild beasts, with the blows of clubs 
and other weapons. At last they stript off their clothes and threw them on 
the fire, which they were the more likely to quench, the more they had been 
soiled by common use.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>IN the year of the consulship of <name type="person">Caius Vipstanus</name> and <name type="person">Caius 
Fonteius</name>, <name type="person">Nero</name> deferred no more a long meditated crime. Length of power had 
matured his daring, and his passion for <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> daily grew more ardent. 
As the woman had no hope of marriage for herself or of <name type="person">Octavia</name>'s divorce 
while <name type="person">Agrippina</name> lived, she would reproach the emperor with incessant 
vituperation and sometimes call him in jest a mere ward who was under the 
rule of others, and was so far from having empire that he had not even his 
liberty. "Why," she asked, "was her marriage put off? Was it, forsooth, her 
beauty and her ancestors, with their triumphal honours, that failed to 
please, or her being a mother, and her sincere heart? No; the fear was that 
as a wife at least she would divulge the wrongs of the Senate, and the wrath 
of the people at the arrogance and rapacity of his mother. If the only 
daughter-in-law <name type="person">Agrippina</name> could bear was one who wished evil to her son, let 
her be restored to her union with <name type="person">Otho</name>. She would go anywhere in the world, 
where she might hear of the insults heaped on the emperor, rather than 
witness them, and be also involved in his perils." </p>
<p>These and the like 
complaints, rendered impressive by tears and by the cunning of an 
adulteress, no one checked, as all longed to see the mother's power broken, 
while not a person believed that the son's hatred would steel his heart to 
her murder.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p><name type="person">Cluvius</name> relates that 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name> in her eagerness to retain her influence went so far that more 
than once at midday, when <name type="person">Nero</name>, even at that hour, was flushed with wine and 
feasting, she presented herself attractively attired to her half intoxicated 
son and offered him her person, and that when kinsfolk observed wanton 
kisses and caresses, por-

tending infamy, it was <name type="person">Seneca</name> who sought a female's aid 
against a woman's fascinations, and hurried in <name type="person">Acte</name>, the freed girl, who 
alarmed at her own peril and at <name type="person">Nero</name>'s disgrace, told him that the incest 
was notorious, as his mother boasted of it, and that the soldiers would 
never endure the rule of an impious sovereign. <name type="person">Fabius Rusticus</name> tells us that 
it was not <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, but <name type="person">Nero</name>, who lusted for the crime, and that it was 
frustrated by the adroitness of that same freed girl. <name type="person">Cluvius</name>'s account, 
however, is also that of all other authors, and popular belief inclines to 
it, whether it was that <name type="person">Agrippina</name> really conceived such a monstrous 
wickedness in her heart, or perhaps because the thought of a strange passion 
seemed comparatively credible in a woman, who in her girlish years had 
allowed herself to be seduced by <name type="person">Lepidus</name> in the hope of winning power, had 
stooped with a like ambition to the lust of <name type="person">Pallas</name>, and had trained herself 
for every infamy by her marriage with her uncle.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> accordingly avoided secret interviews with her, and when she 
withdrew to her gardens or to her estates at <rs type="placename">Tusculum</rs> and <rs type="placename">Antium</rs>, he praised 
her for courting repose. At last, convinced that she would be too 
formidable, wherever she might dwell, he resolved to destroy her, merely 
deliberating whether it was to be accomplished by poison, or by the sword, 
or by any other violent means. Poison at first seemed best, but, were it to 
be administered at the imperial table, the result could not be referred to 
chance after the recent circumstances of the death of <name type="person">Britannicus</name>. Again, to 
tamper with the servants of a woman who, from her familiarity with crime, 
was on her guard against treachery, appeared to be extremely difficult, and 
then, too, she had fortified her constitution by the use of antidotes. How 
again the dagger and its work were to be kept secret, no one could suggest, 
and it was feared too that whoever might be chosen to execute such a crime 
would spurn the order. </p>
<p>An ingenious suggestion was offered by <name type="person">Anicetus</name>, 
a freedman, commander of the fleet at <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs>, who 
had been tutor to <name type="person">Nero</name> in boyhood and had a hatred of <name type="person">Agrippina</name> which she 
reciprocated. He explained that a vessel could be constructed, from which a 
part might by a contrivance be detached, when out at sea, so as to plunge 
her unawares into

the water. "Nothing, he said, "allowed of 
accidents so much as the sea, and should she be overtaken by shipwreck, who 
would be so unfair as to impute to crime an offence committed by the winds 
and waves? The emperor would add the honour of a temple and of shrines to 
the deceased lady, with every other display of filial affection."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> liked the device, favoured as it also was 
by the particular time, for he was celebrating <name type="person">Minerva</name>'s five days' festival 
at <rs type="placename">Bai&aelig;</rs>. Thither he enticed his mother by 
repeated assurances that children ought to bear with the irritability of 
parents and to soothe their tempers, wishing thus to spread a rumour of 
reconciliation and to secure <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s acceptance through the feminine 
credulity, which easily believes what gives joy. As she approached, he went 
to the shore to meet her (she was coming from <rs type="placename">Antium</rs>), welcomed her with outstretched hand and 
embrace, and conducted her to <rs type="placename">Bauli</rs>. This was the name of a country house, 
washed by a bay of the sea, between the promontory of <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs> and the lake of <rs type="placename">Bai&aelig;</rs>. Here was a vessel distinguished from others 
by its equipment, seemingly meant, among other things, to do honour to his 
mother; for she had been accustomed to sail in a trireme, with a crew of 
marines. And now she was invited to a banquet, that night might serve to 
conceal the crime. It was well known that somebody had been found to betray 
it, that <name type="person">Agrippina</name> had heard of the plot, and in doubt whether she was to 
believe it, was conveyed to <rs type="placename">Bai&aelig;</rs> in her 
litter. There some soothing words allayed her fear; she was graciously 
received, and seated at table above the emperor. <name type="person">Nero</name> prolonged the banquet 
with various conversation, passing from a youth's playful familiarity to an 
air of constraint, which seemed to indicate serious thought, and then, after 
protracted festivity, escorted her on her departure, clinging with kisses to 
her eyes and bosom, either to crown his hypocrisy or because the last sight 
of a mother on the even of destruction caused a lingering even in that 
brutal heart.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>A night of brilliant 
starlight with the calm of a tranquil sea was granted by heaven, seemingly, 
to convict the crime. The vessel had not gone far, <name type="person">Agrippina</name> having with her 
two of her intimate attendants, one of whom, <name type="person">Crepereius Gallus</name>, stood near 
the helm, while <name type="person">Acerronia</name>, reclining at <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">ATTEMPT 
TO DROWN AGRIPPINA FAILS</note>
feet as she reposed herself, spoke joyfully 
of her son's repentance and of the recovery of the mother's influence, when 
at a given signal the ceiling of the place, which was loaded with a quantity 
of lead, fell in, and <name type="person">Crepereius</name> was crushed and instantly killed. <name type="person">Agrippina</name> 
and <name type="person">Acerronia</name> were protected by the projecting sides of the couch, which 
happened to be too strong to yield under the weight. But this was not 
followed by the breaking up of the vessel; for all were bewildered, and 
those too, who were in the plot, were hindered by the unconscious majority. 
The crew then thought it best to throw the vessel on one side and so sink 
it, but they could not themselves promptly unite to face the emergency, and 
others, by counteracting the attempt, gave an opportunity of a gentler fall 
into the sea. <name type="person">Acerronia</name>, however, thoughtlessly exclaiming that she was 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and imploring help for the emperor's mother, was despatched with 
poles and oars, and such naval implements as chance offered. <name type="person">Agrippina</name> was 
silent and was thus the less recognized; still, she received a wound in her 
shoulder. She swam, then met with some small boats which conveyed her to the 
<rs type="placename">Lucrine</rs> lake, and so entered her house.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>There she reflected how for this very purpose 
she had been invited by a lying letter and treated with conspicuous honour, 
how also it was near the shore, not from being driven by winds or dashed on 
rocks, that the vessel had in its upper part collapsed, like a mechanism 
anything but nautical. She pondered too the death of <name type="person">Acerronia</name>; she looked 
at her own wound, and saw that her only safeguard against treachery was to 
ignore it. Then she sent her freedman <name type="person">Agerinus</name> to tell her son how by 
heaven's favour and his good fortune she had escaped a terrible disaster; 
that she begged him, alarmed, as he might be, by his mother's peril, to put 
off the duty of a visit, as for the present she needed repose. Meanwhile, 
pretending that she felt secure, she applied remedies to her wound, and 
fomentations to her person. She then ordered search to be made for the will 
of <name type="person">Acerronia</name>, and her property to be sealed, in this alone throwing off 
disguise.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p><name type="person">Nero</name>, meantime, as he waited 
for tidings of the consummation of the deed, received information that she 
had escaped with the injury of a slight wound, after having so

far encountered the peril that there could be no question as to its 
author. Then, paralysed with terror and protesting that she would show 
herself the next moment eager for vengeance, either arming the slaves or 
stirring up the soldiery, or hastening to the Senate and the people, to 
charge him with the wreck, with her wound, and with the destruction of her 
friends, he asked what resource he had against all this, unless something 
could be at once devised by <name type="person">Burrus</name> and <name type="person">Seneca</name>. He had instantly summoned 
both of them, and possibly they were already in the secret. There was a long 
silence on their part; they feared they might remonstrate in vain, or 
believed the crisis to be such that <name type="person">Nero</name> must perish, unless <name type="person">Agrippina</name> were 
at once crushed. Thereupon <name type="person">Seneca</name> was so far the more prompt as to glance 
back on <name type="person">Burrus</name>, as if to ask him whether the bloody deed must be required of 
the soldiers. <name type="person">Burrus</name> replied "that the pr&aelig;torians were attached to the 
whole family of the C&aelig;sars, and remembering <name type="person">Germanicus</name> would not dare 
a savage deed on his offspring. It was for <name type="person">Anicetus</name> to accomplish his 
promise." </p>
<p><name type="person">Anicetus</name>, without a pause, claimed for himself the 
consummation of the crime. At those words, <name type="person">Nero</name> declared that that day gave 
him empire, and that a freedman was the author of this mighty boon. "Go," he 
said, "with all speed and take with you the men readiest to execute your 
orders." He himself, when he had heard of the arrival of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s 
messenger, <name type="person">Agerinus</name>, contrived a theatrical mode of accusation, and, while 
the man was repeating his message, threw down a sword at his feet, then 
ordered him to be put in irons, as a detected criminal, so that he might 
invent a story how his mother had plotted the emperor's destruction and in 
the shame of discovered guilt had by her own choice sought death.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>Meantime, <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s peril being universally 
known and taken to be an accidental occurrence, everybody, the moment he 
heard of it, hurried down to the beach. Some climbed projecting piers; some 
the nearest vessels; others, as far as their stature allowed, went into the 
sea; some, again, stood with outstretched arms, while the whole shore rung 
with wailings, with prayers and cries, as different questions were asked and 
uncertain answers given. A vast multi-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">AGRIPPINA 
MURDERED</note> 
tude streamed to the spot with torches, and as soon as all 
knew that she was safe, they at once prepared to wish her joy, till the 
sight of an armed and threatening force scared them away. <name type="person">Anicetus</name> then 
surrounded the house with a guard, and having burst open the gates, dragged 
off the slaves who met him, till he came to the door of her chamber, where a 
few still stood, after the rest had fled in terror at the attack. A small 
lamp was in the room, and one slave-girl with <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, who grew more and 
more anxious, as no messenger came from her son, not even <name type="person">Agerinus</name>, while 
the appearance of the shore was changed, a solitude one moment, then sudden 
bustle and tokens of the worst catastrophe. As the girl rose to depart, she 
exclaimed, "Do you too forsake me?" and looking round saw <name type="person">Anicetus</name>, who had 
with him the captain of the trireme, <name type="person">Herculeius</name>, and <name type="person">Obaritus</name>, a centurion 
of marines. "If," said she, "you have come to see me, take back word that I 
have recovered, but if you are here to do a crime, I believe nothing about 
my son; he has not ordered his mother's murder." </p>
<p>The assassins closed in 
round her couch, and the captain of the trireme first struck her head 
violently with a club. Then, as the centurion bared his sword for the fatal 
deed presenting her person, she exclaimed, "Smite my womb," and with many 
wounds she was slain.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>So far our 
accounts agree. That <name type="person">Nero</name> gazed on his mother after her death and praised 
her beauty, some have related, while others deny it. Her body was burnt that 
same night on a dining couch, with a mean funeral; nor, as long as <name type="person">Nero</name> was 
in power, was the earth raised into a mound, or even decently closed. 
Subsequently, she received from the solicitude of her domestics, a humble 
sepulchre on the road to <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs>, near the country 
house of <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name> the Dictator, which from a great height commands a view 
of the bay beneath. As soon as the funeral pile was lighted, one of her 
freedmen, surnamed <name type="person">Mnester</name>, ran himself through with a sword, either from 
love of his mistress or from the fear of destruction. </p>
<p>Many years before 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name> had anticipated this end for herself and had spurned the thought. 
For when she consulted the astrologers about <name type="person">Nero</name>, they replied that he 
would be

emperor and kill his mother. "Let him kill her," she 
said, "provided he is emperor."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>But 
the emperor, when the crime was at last accomplished, realised its 
portentous guilt. The rest of the night, now silent and stupified, now and 
still oftener starting up in terror, bereft of reason, he awaited the dawn 
as if it would bring with it his doom. He was first encouraged to hope by 
the flattery addressed to him, at the prompting of <name type="person">Burrus</name>, by the centurions 
and tribunes, who again and again pressed his hand and congratulated him on 
his having escaped an unforeseen danger and his mother's daring crime. Then 
his friends went to the temples, and, an example having once been set, the 
neighbouring towns of <rs type="placename">Campania</rs> testified their joy 
with sacrifices and deputations. He himself, with an opposite phase of 
hypocrisy, seemed sad, and almost angry at his own deliverance, and shed 
tears over his mother's death. But as the aspects of places change not, as 
do the looks of men, and as he had ever before his eyes the dreadful sight 
of that sea with its shores (some too believed that the notes of a funereal 
trumpet were heard from the surrounding heights, and wailings from the 
mother's grave), he retired to <rs type="placename">Neapolis</rs> and sent a 
letter to the Senate, the drift of which was that <name type="person">Agerinus</name>, one of 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s confidential freedmen, had been detected with the dagger of an 
assassin, and that in the consciousness of having planned the crime she had 
paid its penalty.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>He even revived the 
charges of a period long past, how she had aimed at a share of empire, and 
at inducing the pr&aelig;torian cohorts to swear obedience to a woman, to 
the disgrace of the Senate and people; how, when she was disappointed, in 
her fury with the soldiers, the Senate, and the populace, she opposed the 
usual donative and largess, and organised perilous prosecutions against 
distinguished citizens. What efforts had it cost him to hinder her from 
bursting into the Senate-house and giving answers to foreign nations! He 
glanced too with indirect censure at the days of <name type="person">Claudius</name>, and ascribed all 
the abominations of that reign to his mother, thus seeking to show that it 
was the State's good fortune which had destroyed her. For he actually told 
the story of the shipwreck; but who could be so stupid as to 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO'S JUSTIFICATION; PUBLIC THANKSGIVING</note>
believe that 
it was accidental, or that a shipwrecked woman had sent one man with a 
weapon to break through an emperor's guards and fleets? So now it was not 
<name type="person">Nero</name>, whose brutality was far beyond any remonstrance, but <name type="person">Seneca</name> who was in 
ill repute, for having written a confession in such a style.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>Still there was a marvellous rivalry among the 
nobles in decreeing thanksgivings at all the shrines, and the celebration 
with annual games of <name type="person">Minerva</name>'s festival, as the day on which the plot had 
been discovered; also, that a golden image of <name type="person">Minerva</name> with a statue of the 
emperor by its side should be set up in the <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs>, and that 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s birthday should be classed among the inauspicious days. <name type="person">Thrasea 
P&aelig;tus</name>, who had been used to pass over previous flatteries in silence 
or with brief assent, then walked out of the Senate, thereby imperilling 
himself, without communicating to the other senators any impulse towards 
freedom.</p>
<p>There occurred too a thick succession of portents, which meant 
nothing. A woman gave birth to a snake, and another was killed by a 
thunderbolt in her husband's embrace. Then the sun was suddenly darkened and 
the fourteen districts of the city were struck by lightning. All this 
happened quite without any providential design; so much so, that for many 
subsequent years <name type="person">Nero</name> prolonged his reign and his crimes. Still, to deepen 
the popular hatred towards his mother, and prove that since her removal, his 
clemency had increased, he restored to their ancestral homes two 
distinguished ladies, <name type="person">Junia</name> and <name type="person">Calpurnia</name>, with two ex-pr&aelig;tors, 
<name type="person">Valerius Capito</name> and <name type="person">Licinius Gabolus</name>, whom <name type="person">Agrippina</name> had formerly banished. 
He also allowed the ashes of <name type="person">Lollia Paulina</name> to be brought back and a tomb to 
be built over them. <name type="person">Iturius</name> and <name type="person">Calvisius</name>, whom he had himself temporarily 
exiled, he now released from their penalty. <name type="person">Silana</name> indeed had died a natural 
death at <rs type="placename">Tarentum</rs>, whither she had returned from her 
distant exile, when the power of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, to whose enmity she owed her 
fall, began to totter, or her wrath was at last appeased.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>While <name type="person">Nero</name> was lingering in the towns of <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>, doubting how he should enter <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, whether he would find the Senate submissive and 
the populace enthusiastic, all the

vilest courtiers, and of these 
never had a court a more abundant crop, argued against his hesitation by 
assuring him that <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s name was hated and that her death had 
heightened his popularity. "He might go without a fear," they said, "and 
experience in his person men's veneration for him." They insisted at the 
same time on preceding him. They found greater enthusiasm than they had 
promised, the tribes coming forth to meet him, the Senate in holiday attire, 
troops of their children and wives arranged according to sex and age, tiers 
of seats raised for the spectacle, where he was to pass, as a triumph is 
witnessed. Thus elated and exulting over his people's slavery, he proceeded 
to the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs>, performed the thanksgiving, and then plunged into all the 
excesses, which, though ill-restrained, some sort of respect for his mother 
had for a while delayed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>He had long 
had a fancy for driving a four-horse chariot, and a no less degrading taste 
for singing to the harp, in a theatrical fashion, when he was at dinner. 
This he would remind people was a royal custom, and had been the practice of 
ancient chiefs; it was celebrated too in the praises of poets and was meant 
to show honour to the gods. Songs indeed, he said, were sacred to <name type="person">Apollo</name>, 
and it was in the dress of a singer that that great and prophetic deity was 
seen in Roman temples as well as in Greek cities. He could no longer be 
restrained, when <name type="person">Seneca</name> and <name type="person">Burrus</name> thought it best to concede one point that 
he might not persist in both. A space was enclosed in the <rs type="placename">Vatican valley</rs> 
where he might manage his horses, without the spectacle being public. Soon 
he actually invited all the people of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, who 
extolled him in their praises, like a mob which craves for amusements and 
rejoices when a prince draws them the same way. However, the public exposure 
of his shame acted on him as an incentive instead of sickening him, as men 
expected. Imagining that he mitigated the scandal by disgracing many others, 
he brought on the stage descendants of noble families, who sold themselves 
because they were paupers. As they have ended their days, I think it due to 
their ancestors not to hand down their names. And indeed the infamy is his 
who gave them wealth to reward their degradation rather than to deter them 
from degrading themselves. He prevailed too on some well-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO'S AMUSEMENTS</note>
known Roman knights, by immense 
presents, to offer their services in the amphitheatre; only pay from one who 
is able to command, carries with it the force of compulsion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>Still, not yet wishing to disgrace himself on a 
public stage, he instituted some games under the title of "juvenile sports," 
for which people of every class gave in their names. Neither rank nor age 
nor previous high promotion hindered any one from practising the art of a 
Greek or Latin actor and even stooping to gestures and songs unfit for a 
man. Noble ladies too actually played disgusting parts, and in the grove, 
with which <name type="person">Augustus</name> had surrounded the lake for the naval fight, there were 
erected places for meeting and refreshment, and every incentive to excess 
was offered for sale. Money too was distributed, which the respectable had 
to spend under sheer compulsion and which the profligate gloried in 
squandering. Hence a rank growth of abominations and of all infamy. Never 
did a more filthy rabble add a worse licentiousness to our long corrupted 
morals. Even, with virtuous training, purity is not easily upheld; far less 
amid rivalries in vice could modesty or propriety or any trace of good 
manners be preserved. Last of all, the emperor himself came on the stage, 
tuning his lute with elaborate care and trying his voice with his 
attendants. There were also present, to complete the show, a guard of 
soldiers with centurions and tribunes, and <name type="person">Burrus</name>, who grieved and yet 
applauded. Then it was that Roman knights were first enrolled under the 
title of Augustani, men in their prime and remarkable for their strength, 
some, from a natural frivolity, others from the hope of promotion. Day and 
night they kept up a thunder of applause, and applied to the emperor's 
person and voice the epithets of deities. Thus they lived in fame and 
honour, as if on the strength of their merits.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> however, that he might not be known only for his 
accomplishments as an actor, also affected a taste for poetry, and drew 
round him persons who had some skill in such compositions, but not yet 
generally recognised. They used to sit with him, stringing together verses 
prepared at home, or extemporised on the spot, and fill up his own 
expressions, such as they were, just as he threw them off. This

is mainly shown by the very character of the poems, which have no 
vigour or inspiration, or unity in their flow. </p>
<p>He would also bestow some 
leisure after his banquets on the teachers of philosophy, for he enjoyed the 
wrangles of opposing dogmatists. And some there were who liked to exhibit 
their gloomy faces and looks, as one of the amusements of the court.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>About the same time a trifling beginning led 
to frightful bloodshed between the inhabitants of <rs type="placename">Nuceria</rs> and <rs type="placename">Pompeii</rs>, at a 
gladiatorial show exhibited by <name type="person">Livineius Regulus</name>, who had been, as I have 
related, expelled from the Senate. With the unruly spirit of townsfolk, they 
began with abusive language of each other; then they took up stones and at 
last weapons, the advantage resting with the populace of <rs type="placename">Pompeii</rs>, where the show was being exhibited. And so 
there were brought to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> a number of the people of 
<rs type="placename">Nuceria</rs>, with their bodies mutilated by wounds, and 
many lamented the deaths of children or of parents. The emperor entrusted 
the trial of the case to the Senate, and the Senate to the consuls, and then 
again the matter being referred back to the Senators, the inhabitants of <rs type="placename">Pompeii</rs> were forbidden to have any such public gathering 
for ten years, and all associations they had formed in defiance of the laws 
were dissolved. <name type="person">Livineius</name> and the others who had excited the disturbance, 
were punished with exile.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p><name type="person">Pedius 
Bl&aelig;sus</name> was also expelled from the Senate on the accusation of the 
people of <rs type="placename">Cyrene</rs>, that he had violated the treasury 
of <name type="person">&AElig;sculapius</name> and had tampered with a military levy by bribery and 
corruption. This same people prosecuted <name type="person">Acilius Strabo</name> who had held the 
office of pr&aelig;tor, and had been sent by <name type="person">Claudius</name> to adjudicate on some 
lands which were bequeathed by king <name type="person">Apion</name>, their former possessor, together 
with his kingdom to the Roman people, and which had since been seized by the 
neighbouring proprietors, who trusted to a long continued licence in wrong, 
as if it constituted right and justice. Consequently, when the adjudication 
was against them, there arose a bitter feeling towards the judge, but the 
Senate replied that they knew nothing of the instructions given by <name type="person">Claudius</name>, 
and that the emperor music be consulted. <name type="person">Nero</name>, though he approved <name type="person">Strabo</name>'s 
decision,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PROSECUTIONS; ENTERTAINMENTS AT <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note>
wrote word that nevertheless he was for 
relieving the allies, and that he waived all claim to what had been taken 
into possession.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>Then followed the 
deaths of two illustrious men, <name type="person">Domitius Afer</name> and <name type="person">Marcus Servilius</name>, who had 
flourished through a career of the highest honours and great eloquence. The 
first was a pleader; <name type="person">Servilius</name>, after long practice in the courts, 
distinguished himself by his history of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and by 
the refinement of his life, which the contrast of his character to that of 
<name type="person">Afer</name>, whom he equalled in genius, rendered the more conspicuous.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>In <name type="person">Nero</name>'s fourth consulship with <name type="person">Cornelius 
Cossus</name> for his colleague, a theatrical entertainment to be repeated every 
five years was established at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> in imitation of 
the Greek festival. Like all novelties, it was variously canvassed. There 
were some who declared that even <name type="person">Cnius Pompeius</name> was censured by the older 
men of the day for having set up a fixed and permanent theatre. "Formerly," 
they said, "the games were usually exhibited with hastily erected tiers of 
benches and a temporary stage, and the people stood to witness them, that 
they might not, by having the chance of sitting down, spend a succession of 
entire days in idleness. Let the ancient character of these shows be 
retained, whenever the pr&aelig;tors exhibited them, and let no citizen be 
under the necessity of competing. As it was, the morality of their fathers, 
which had by degrees been forgotten, was utterly subverted by the 
introduction of a lax tone, so that all which could suffer or produce 
corruption was to be seen at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and a degeneracy 
bred by foreign tastes was infecting the youth who devoted themselves to 
athletic sports, to idle loungings and low intrigues, with the encouragement 
of the emperor and Senate, who not only granted licence to vice, but even 
applied a compulsion to drive Roman nobles into disgracing themselves on the 
stage, under the pretence of being orators and poets. What remained for them 
but to strip themselves naked, put on the boxing-glove, and practise such 
battles instead of the arms of legitimate warfare? Would justice be 
promoted, or would they serve on the knights' commissions for the honourable 
office of a judge, because they had listened with critical sagacity to 
effeminate strains of music

and sweet voices? Night too was given 
up to infamy, so that virtue had not a moment left to her, but all the 
vilest of that promiscuous throng dared to do in the darkness anything they 
had lusted for in the day."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>Many 
people liked this very licence, but they screened it under respectable 
names. "Our ancestors," they said, "were not averse to the attractions of 
shows on a scale suited to the wealth of their day, and so they introduced 
actors from the <name type="ethnic">Etruscans</name> and horse-races from <rs type="placename">Thurii</rs>. When we had possessed ourselves of <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, games were 
exhibited with greater elaboration, and yet no one at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> of good family had stooped to the theatrical 
profession during the 200 years following the triumph of <name type="person">Lucius Mummius</name>, who 
first displayed this kind of show in the capital. Besides, even economy had 
been consulted, when a permanent edifice was erected for a theatre, in 
preference to a structure raised and fitted up yearly at vast expense. Nor 
would the magistrates, as hitherto, exhaust their substance, or would the 
populace have the same motive for demanding of them the Greek contests, when 
once the State undertakes the expenditure. The victories won by orators and 
poets would furnish a stimulus to genius, and it could not be a burden for 
any judge to bestow his attention on graceful pursuits or on legitimate 
recreations. It was to mirth rather than to profligacy that a few nights 
every five years were devoted, and in these amid such a blaze of 
illumination no lawless conduct could be concealed." </p>
<p>This entertainment, 
it is true, passed off without any notorious scandal. The enthusiasm too of 
the populace was not even slightly kindled, for the pantomimic actors, 
though permitted to return to the stage, were excluded from the sacred 
contests. No one gained the first prize for eloquence, but it was publicly 
announced that the emperor was victorious. Greek dresses, in which most 
people showed themselves during this festival, had then gone out of 
fashion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>A comet meantime blazed in 
the sky, which in popular opinion always portends revolution to kingdoms. So 
people began to ask, as if <name type="person">Nero</name> was already dethroned, who was to be 
elected. In every one's mouth was the name of <name type="person">Rubellius Blandus</name>, who 
inherited through his mother the high nobility

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">LICENCE 
DEFENDED; A PRODIGY</note>
of the <placeName key="tgn,2075295">Julian</placeName> family. He was himself attached to 
the ideas of our ancestors; his manners were austere, his home was one of 
purity and seclusion, and the more he lived in retirement from fear, the 
more fame did he acquire. Popular talk was confirmed by an interpretation 
put with similar credulity on a flash of lightning. While <name type="person">Nero</name> was reclining 
at dinner in his house named <rs type="placename">Sublaqueum</rs> on the <rs type="placename">Simbruine</rs> lake, the table with the banquet was struck 
and shattered, and as this happened close to <rs type="placename">Tibur</rs>, 
from which town <name type="person">Plautus</name> derived his origin on his father's side, people 
believed him to be the man marked out by divine providence; and he was 
encouraged by that numerous class, whose eager and often mistaken ambition 
it is to attach themselves prematurely to some new and hazardous cause. This 
alarmed <name type="person">Nero</name>, and he wrote a letter to <name type="person">Plautus</name>, bidding "him consider the 
tranquillity of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> and withdraw himself from 
mischievous gossip. He had ancestral possessions in <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, where he might enjoy his youth safely and 
quietly." And so thither <name type="person">Plautus</name> retired with his wife <name type="person">Antistia</name> and a few 
intimate friends. </p>
<p>About the same time an excessive love of luxurious 
gratification involved <name type="person">Nero</name> in disgrace and danger. He had plunged for a 
swim into the source of the stream which <name type="person">Quintus Marcius</name> conveyed to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and it was thought that, by thus immersing his 
person in it, he had polluted the sacred waters and the sanctity of the 
spot. A fit of illness which followed, convinced people of the divine 
displeasure.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name> meanwhile having 
demolished <rs type="placename">Artaxata</rs> thought that he ought to avail 
himself of the recent panic by possessing himself of <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs>, and either, by destroying it, increase the 
enemy's terror, or, by sparing it, win a name for mercy. Thither he marched 
his army, with no hostile demonstrations, lest he might cut off all hope of 
quarter, but still without relaxing his vigilance, knowing, as he did, the 
fickle temper of the people, who are as treacherous, when they have an 
opportunity, as they are slow to meet danger. The barbarians, following 
their individual inclinations, either came to him with entreaties, or 
quitted their villages and dispersed into their deserts. Some there were who 
hid themselves in caverns with all that they held dearest. The Roman general 
accordingly dealt variously with them;

he was merciful to 
suppliants, swift in pursuit of fugitives, pitiless towards those who had 
crept into hiding-places, burning them out after filling up the entrances 
and exits with brushwood and bushes. As he was on his march along the 
frontier of the <name type="ethnic">Mardi</name>, he was incessantly attacked by that tribe which is 
trained to guerilla warfare, and defended by mountains against an invader. 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name> threw the <name type="ethnic">Iberians</name> on them, ravaged their country and punished the 
enemy's daring at the cost of the blood of the foreigner.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>Both <name type="person">Corbulo</name> and his army, though suffering no 
losses in battle, were becoming exhausted by short supplies and hardships, 
compelled as they were to stave off hunger solely by the flesh of cattle. 
Added to this was scarcity of water, a burning summer and long marches, all 
of which were alleviated only by the general's patient endurance. He bore 
indeed the same or even more burdens than the common soldier. Subsequently, 
they reached lands under cultivation, and reaped the crops, and of two 
fortresses in which the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> had fled for refuge, one was taken by 
storm; the other, which repulsed the first attack, was reduced by blockade. 
Thence the general crossed into the country of the <name type="ethnic">Tauraunites</name>, where he 
escaped an unforeseen peril. Near his tent, a barbarian of no mean rank was 
discovered with a dagger, who divulged under torture the whole method of the 
plot, its contrivance by himself, and his associates. The men who under a 
show of friendship planned the treachery, were convicted and punished. 
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, <name type="person">Corbulo</name>'s envoys whom he had sent to <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs>, reported that the city walls were open, 
and the inhabitants awaiting orders. They also handed him a gift denoting 
friendship, a golden crown, which he acknowledged in complimentary language. 
Nothing was done to humiliate the city, that remaining uninjured it might 
continue to yield a more cheerful obedience.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>The citadel, however, which had been closed by an intrepid band 
of youths, was not stormed without a struggle They even ventured on an 
engagement under the walls, but were driven back within their fortifications 
and succumbed at last only to our siege-works and to the swords of furious 
assailants. The success was the easier, as the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> were
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CORBULO'S ACTIVITIES IN EAST</note>
distracted by a war with the 
<name type="ethnic">Hyrcanians</name>, who had sent to the Roman emperor, imploring alliance, and 
pointing to the fact that they were detaining <name type="person">Vologeses</name> as a pledge of 
amity. When these envoys were on their way home, <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, to save them from 
being intercepted by the enemy's picquets after their passage of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, gave them an escort, and conducted them to 
the shores of the <rs type="placename">Red Sea</rs>, whence, avoiding Parthian 
territory, they returned to their native possessions.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name> too, as <name type="person">Tiridates</name> was entering the Armenian 
frontier through <rs type="placename">Media</rs>, sent on <name type="person">Verulanus</name>, his 
lieutenant-general with the auxiliaries, while he himself followed with the 
legions by forced marches, and compelled him to retreat to a distance and 
abandon the idea of war. Having harried with fire and sword all whom he had 
ascertained to be against us, he began to take possession of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, when <name type="person">Tigranes</name> arrived, whom <name type="person">Nero</name> had selected 
to assume the sovereignty. Though a Cappadocian noble and grandson of king 
<name type="person">Archelaus</name>, yet, from having long been a hostage at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, he had sunk into servile submissiveness. Nor was 
he unanimously welcomed, as some still cherished a liking for the Arsacids. 
Most, however, in their hatred of <name type="ethnic">Parthian</name> arrogance preferred a king given 
them by <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. He was supported too with a force of a 
thousand legionaries, three allied cohorts and two squadrons of cavalry, 
that he might the more easily secure his new kingdom. Parts of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, according to their respective proximities, were 
put under the subjection of <name type="person">Pharasmanes</name>, <name type="person">Polemo</name>, <name type="person">Aristobulus</name>, and <name type="person">Antiochus</name>. 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name> retired into <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, which province, as being 
vacant by the death of its governor <name type="person">Ummidius</name>, was intrusted to him.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>One of the famous cities of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, <rs type="placename">Laodicea</rs>, was that same 
year overthrown by an earthquake, and, without any relief from us, recovered 
itself by its own resources. In <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> meanwhile the 
old town of <rs type="placename">Puteoli</rs> obtained from <name type="person">Nero</name> the 
privileges of a colony with an additional name. A further enrolment of 
veterans in <rs type="placename">Tarentum</rs> and <rs type="placename">Antium</rs> did but little for those thinly peopled places; 
for most scattered themselves in the provinces where they had completed 
their military service. Not being accustomed to tie themselves by mar-

riage and rear children, they left behind them homes without 
families. For whole legions were no longer transplanted, as in former days, 
with tribunes and centurions and soldiers of every grade, so as to form a 
state by their unity and mutual attachment, but strangers to one another 
from different companies, without a head or any community of sentiment, were 
suddenly gathered together, as it might be out of any other class of human 
beings, and became a mere crowd rather than a colony.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>As at the elections for pr&aelig;tors, now 
generally under the Senate's control, there was the excitement of a 
particularly keen competition, the emperor quieted matters by promoting the 
three supernumerary candidates to legionary commands. He also raised the 
dignity of the Senate, by deciding that all who appealed from private judges 
to its house, were to incur the same pecuniary risk as those who referred 
their cause to the emperor. Hitherto such an appeal had been perfectly open, 
and free from penalty. </p>
<p>At the close of the year <name type="person">Vibius Secundus</name>, a Roman 
knight, on the accusation of the <name type="ethnic">Moors</name>, was convicted of extortion, and 
banished from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, contriving through the 
influence of his brother <name type="person">Vibius Crispus</name> to escape heavier punishment.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>In the consulship of <name type="person">C&aelig;sonius 
P&aelig;tus</name> and <name type="person">Petronius Turpilianus</name>, a serious disaster was sustained in 
<rs type="placename">Britain</rs>, where <name type="person">Aulius Didius</name>, the emperor's legate, 
had merely retained our existing possessions, and his successor <name type="person">Veranius</name>, 
after having ravaged the <name type="ethnic">Silures</name> in some trifling raids, was prevented by 
death from extending the war. While he lived, he had a great name for manly 
independence, though, in his will's final words, he betrayed a flatterer's 
weakness; for, after heaping adulation on <name type="person">Nero</name>, he added that he should have 
conquered the province for him, had he lived for the next two years. Now, 
however, <rs type="placename">Britain</rs> was in the hands of <name type="person">Suetonius 
Paulinus</name>, who in military knowledge and in popular favour, which allows no 
one to be without a rival, vied with <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, and aspired to equal the glory 
of the recovery of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> by the subjugation of 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s enemies. He therefore prepared to attack the island of <rs type="placename">Mona</rs> which had a powerful population and was a refuge 
for fugitives. He built flat-bottomed vessels to cope with the shallows, and 
uncer-

tain depths of the sea. Thus the infantry 
crossed, while the cavalry followed by fording, or, where the water was 
deep, swam by the side of their horses.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>On the shore stood the opposing army with its dense array of 
armed warriors, while between the ranks dashed women, in black attire like 
the Furies, with hair dishevelled, waving brands. All around, the Druids, 
lifting up their hands to heaven, and pouring forth dreadful imprecations, 
scared our soldiers by the unfamiliar sight, so that, as if their limbs were 
paralysed, they stood motionless, and exposed to wounds. Then urged by their 
general's appeals and mutual encouragements not to quail before a troop of 
frenzied women, they bore the standards onwards, smote down all resistance, 
and wrapped the foe in the flames of his own brands. A force was next set 
over the conquered, and their groves, devoted to inhuman superstitions, were 
destroyed. They deemed it indeed a duty to cover their altars with the blood 
of captives and to consult their deities through human entrails.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p><name type="person">Suetonius</name> while thus occupied received 
tidings of the sudden revolt of the province. <name type="person">Prasutagus</name>, king of the <name type="ethnic">Iceni</name>, 
famed for his long prosperity, had made the emperor his heir along with his 
two daughters, under the impression that this token of submission would put 
his kingdom and his house out of the reach of wrong. But the reverse was the 
result, so much so that his kingdom was plundered by centurions, his house 
by slaves, as if they were the spoils of war. First, his wife <name type="person">Boudicea</name> was 
scourged, and his daughters outraged. All the chief men of the <name type="ethnic">Iceni</name>, as if 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> had received the whole country as a gift, were 
stript of their ancestral possessions, and the king's relatives were made 
slaves. Roused by these insults and the dread of worse, reduced as they now 
were into the condition of a province, they flew to arms and stirred to 
revolt the <name type="ethnic">Trinobantes</name> and others who, not yet cowed by slavery, had agreed 
in secret conspiracy to reclaim their freedom. It was against the veterans 
that their hatred was most intense. For these new settlers in the colony of 
<rs type="placename">Camulodunum</rs> drove people out of their houses, 
ejected them from their farms, called them captives and slaves, and the 
lawlessness of the veterans was encouraged by the soldiers,

who 
lived a similar life and hoped for similar licence. A temple also erected to 
the Divine <name type="person">Claudius</name> was ever before their eyes, a citadel, as it seemed, of 
perpetual tyranny. Men chosen as priests had to squander their whole 
fortunes under the pretence of a religious ceremonial. It appeared too no 
difficult matter to destroy the colony, undefended as it was by 
fortifications, a precaution neglected by our generals, while they thought 
more of what was agreeable than of what was expedient.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>Meanwhile, without any evident cause, the statue of 
Victory at <rs type="placename">Camulodunum</rs> fell prostrate and turned its 
back to the enemy, as though it fled before them. Women excited to frenzy 
prophesied impending destruction; ravings in a strange tongue, it was said, 
were heard in their <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs>; their theatre resounded with wailings, and 
in the estuary of the <rs type="placename">Tamesa</rs> had been seen the appearance of an overthrown 
town; even the ocean had worn the aspect of blood, and, when the tide ebbed, 
there had been left the likenesses of human forms, marvels interpreted by 
the <name type="ethnic">Britons</name>, as hopeful, by the veterans, as alarming. But as <name type="person">Suetonius</name> was 
far away, they implored aid from the procurator, <name type="person">Catus Decianus</name>. All he did 
was to send two hundred men, and no more, without regular arms, and there 
was in the place but a small military force. Trusting to the protection of 
the temple, hindered too by secret accomplices in the revolt, who 
embarrassed their plans, they had constructed neither fosse nor rampart; nor 
had they removed their old men and women, leaving their youth alone to face 
the foe. Surprised, as it were, in the midst of peace, they were surrounded 
by an immense host of the barbarians. All else was plundered or fired in the 
onslaught; the temple where the soldiers had assembled, was stormed after a 
two days' siege. The victorious enemy met <name type="person">Petilius Cerialis</name>, commander of 
the ninth legion, as he was coming to the rescue, routed his troops, and 
destroyed all his infantry. <name type="person">Cerialis</name> escaped with some cavalry into the 
camp, and was saved by its fortifications. Alarmed by this disaster and by 
the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity, the 
procurator <name type="person">Catus</name> crossed over into <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p><name type="person">Suetonius</name>, however, with wonderful 
resolution,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">MASSACRES OF ROMANS IN <rs type="placename">BRITAIN</rs></note>
marched amidst a hostile population to 
<rs type="placename">Londinium</rs>, which, though undistinguished by the name 
of a colony, was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading 
vessels. Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war, as he 
looked round on his scanty force of soldiers, and remembered with what a 
serious warning the rashness of <name type="person">Petilius</name> had been punished, he resolved to 
save the province at the cost of a single town. Nor did the tears and 
weeping of the people, as they implored his aid, deter him from giving the 
signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him. 
Those who were chained to the spot by the weakness of their sex, or the 
infirmity of age, or the attractions of the place, were cut off by the 
enemy. Like ruin fell on the town of <rs type="placename">Verulamium</rs>, for 
the barbarians, who delighted in plunder and were indifferent to all else, 
passed by the fortresses with military garrisons, and attacked whatever 
offered most wealth to the spoiler, and was unsafe for defence. About 
seventy thousand citizens and allies, it appeared, fell in the places which 
I have mentioned. For it was not on making prisoners and selling them, or on 
any of the barter of war, that the enemy was bent, but on slaughter, on the 
gibbet, the fire and the cross, like men soon about to pay the penalty, and 
meanwhile snatching at instant vengeance.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p><name type="person">Suetonius</name> had the fourteenth legion with the veterans of the 
twentieth, and auxiliaries from the neighbourhood, to the number of about 
ten thousand armed men, when he prepared to break off delay and fight a 
battle. He chose a position approached by a narrow defile, closed in at the 
rear by a forest, having first ascertained that there was not a soldier of 
the enemy except in his front, where an open plain extended without any 
danger from ambuscades. His legions were in close array; round them, the 
light-armed troops, and the cavalry in dense array on the wings. On the 
other side, the army of the <name type="ethnic">Britons</name>, with its masses of infantry and 
cavalry, was confidently exulting, a vaster host than ever had assembled, 
and so fierce in spirit that they actually brought with them, to witness the 
victory, their wives riding in waggons, which they had placed on the extreme 
border of the plain.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p><name type="person">Boudicea</name>, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to tribe after 
tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for <name type="ethnic">Britons</name> to fight under the 
leadership of women. "But now," she said, "it is not as a woman descended 
from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging lost 
freedom, my scourged body, the outraged chastity of my daughters. Roman lust 
has gone so far that not our very persons, nor even age or virginity, are 
left unpolluted. But heaven is on the side of a righteous vengeance; a 
legion which dared to fight has perished; the rest are hiding themselves in 
their camp, or are thinking anxiously of flight. They will not sustain even 
the din and the shout of so many thousands, much less our charge and our 
blows. If you weigh well the strength of the armies, and the causes of the 
war, you will see that in this battle you must conquer or die. This is a 
woman's resolve; as for men, they may live and be slaves."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>Nor was <name type="person">Suetonius</name> silent at such a crisis. Though 
he confided in the valour of his men, he yet mingled encouragements and 
entreaties to disdain the clamours and empty threats of the barbarians. 
"There," he said, "you see more women than warriors. Unwarlike, unarmed, 
they will give way the moment they have recognised that sword and that 
courage of their conquerors, which have so often routed them. Even among 
many legions, it is a few who really decide the battle, and it will enhance 
their glory that a small force should earn the renown of an entire army. 
Only close up the ranks, and having discharged your javelins, then with 
shields and swords continue the work of bloodshed and destruction, without a 
thought of plunder. When once the victory has been won, everything will be 
in your power." </p>
<p>Such was the enthusiasm which followed the general's 
address, and so promptly did the veteran soldiery, with their long 
experience of battles, prepare for the hurling of the javelins, that it was 
with confidence in the result that <name type="person">Suetonius</name> gave the signal of 
battle.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>At first, the legion kept its 
position, clinging to the narrow defile as a defence; when they had 
exhausted their missiles, which they discharged with unerring aim on the 
closely approaching foe, they rushed out in a wedge-like col-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SUETONIUS DEFEATS QUEEN BOUDICEA</note>
umn. Similar was the 
onset of the auxiliaries, while the cavalry with extended lances broke 
through all who offered a strong resistance. The rest turned their back in 
flight, and flight proved difficult, because the surrounding waggons had 
blocked retreat. Our soldiers spared not to slay even the women, while the 
very beasts of burden, transfixed by the missiles, swelled the piles of 
bodies. Great glory, equal to that of our old victories, was won on that 
day. Some indeed say that there fell little less than eighty thousand of the 
<name type="ethnic">Britons</name>, with a loss to our soldiers of about four hundred, and only as many 
wounded. <name type="person">Boudicea</name> put an end to her life by poison. <name type="person">P&oelig;nius Postumus</name> 
too, camp-prefect of the second legion, when he knew of the success of the 
men of the fourteenth and twentieth, feeling that he had cheated his legion 
out of like glory, and had contrary to all military usage disregarded the 
general's orders, threw himself on his sword.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>The whole army was then brought together and kept under canvas 
to finish the remainder of the war. The emperor strengthened the forces by 
sending from <rs type="placename">Germany</rs> two thousand legionaries, eight 
cohorts of auxiliaries, and a thousand cavalry. On their arrival the men of 
the ninth had their number made up with legionary soldiers. The allied 
infantry and cavalry were placed in new winter quarters, and whatever tribes 
still wavered or were hostile were ravaged with fire and sword. Nothing 
however distressed the enemy so much as famine, for they had been careless 
about sowing corn, people of every age having gone to the war, while they 
reckoned on our supplies as their own. Nations, too, so high-spirited 
inclined the more slowly to peace, because <name type="person">Julius Classicanus</name>, who had been 
sent as successor to <name type="person">Catus</name> and was at variance with <name type="person">Suetonius</name>, let private 
animosities interfere with the public interest, and had spread an idea that 
they ought to wait for a new governor who, having neither the anger of an 
enemy nor the pride of a conqueror, would deal mercifully with those who had 
surrendered. At the same time he stated in a despatch to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> that no cessation of fighting must be expected, 
unless <name type="person">Suetonius</name> were superseded, attributing that general's disasters to 
perverseness and his successes to good luck.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>Accordingly one of the imperial freedmen, <name type="person">Polyclitus</name>,

was sent to survey the state of <rs type="placename">Britain</rs>, <name type="person">Nero</name> 
having great hopes that his influence would be able not only to establish a 
good understanding between the governor and the procurator, but also to 
pacify the rebellious spirit of the barbarians. And <name type="person">Polyclitus</name>, who with his 
enormous suite had been a burden to <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> and <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, failed not, as soon as he had crossed the ocean, 
to make his progresses a terror even to our soldiers. But to the enemy he 
was a laughing-stock, for they still retained some of the fire of liberty, 
knowing nothing yet of the power of freedmen, and so they marvelled to see a 
general and an army who had finished such a war cringing to slaves. 
Everything, however, was softened down for the emperor's ears, and <name type="person">Suetonius</name> 
was retained in the government; but as he subsequently lost a few vessels on 
the shore with the crews, he was ordered, as though the war continued, to 
hand over his army to <name type="person">Petronius Turpilianus</name>, who had just resigned his 
consulship. <name type="person">Petronius</name> neither challenged the enemy nor was himself molested, 
and veiled this tame inaction under the honourable name of peace.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>That same year two remarkable crimes were 
committed at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, one by a senator, the other by 
the daring of a slave. <name type="person">Domitius Balbus</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, from his 
prolonged old age, his childlessness and his wealth, was exposed to many a 
plot. His kinsman, <name type="person">Valerius Fabianus</name>, who was marked out for a career of 
promotion, forged a will in his name with <name type="person">Vinicius Rufinus</name> and <name type="person">Terentius 
Lentinus</name>, Roman knights, for his accomplices. These men had associated with 
them <name type="person">Antonius Primus</name> and <name type="person">Asinius Marcellus</name>. <name type="person">Antonius</name> was a man of ready 
audacity; <name type="person">Marcellus</name> had the glory of being the great-grandson of <name type="person">Asinius 
Pollio</name>, and bore a character far from contemptible, except that he thought 
poverty the greatest of all evils. So <name type="person">Fabianus</name>, with the persons whom I have 
named and some others less distinguished, executed the will. The crime was 
proved against them before the Senate, and <name type="person">Fabianus</name> and <name type="person">Antonius</name> with 
<name type="person">Rufinus</name> and <name type="person">Terentius</name> were condemned under the Cornelian law. <name type="person">Marcellus</name> was 
saved from punishment rather than from disgrace by the memory of his 
ancestors and the intercessions of the emperor.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>That same day was fatal also to <name type="person">Pompeius &AElig;lianus</name>, a

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SUETONIUS SUPERSEDED; CRIMES IN <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note>
young ex-qu&aelig;stor, suspected of 
complicity in the villanies of <name type="person">Fabianus</name>. He was outlawed from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, and from <rs type="placename">Spain</rs>, where he 
was born. <name type="person">Valerius Pontius</name> suffered the same degradation for having indicted 
the defendants before the pr&aelig;tor to save them from being prosecuted in 
the court of the city-prefect, purposing meanwhile to defeat justice on some 
legal pretext and subsequently by collusion. A clause was added to the 
Senate's decree, that whoever bought or sold such a service was to be just 
as liable to punishment as if he had been publicly convicted of false 
accusation.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>Soon afterwards one of 
his own slaves murdered the city-prefect, <name type="person">Pedanius Secundus</name>, either because 
he had been refused his freedom, for which he had made a bargain, or in the 
jealousy of a love in which he could not brook his master's rivalry. Ancient 
custom required that the whole slave-establishment which had dwelt under the 
same roof should be dragged to execution, when a sudden gathering of the 
populace, which was for saving so many innocent lives, brought matters to 
actual insurrection. Even in the Senate there was a strong feeling on the 
part of those who shrank from extreme rigour, though the majority were 
opposed to any innovation. Of these, <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name>, in giving his vote, 
argued to the following effect:&mdash;</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>"Often have I been present, Senators, in this assembly when new 
decrees were demanded from us contrary to the customs and laws of our 
ancestors, and I have refrained from opposition, not because I doubted but 
that in all matters the arrangements of the past were better and fairer and 
that all changes were for the worse, but that I might not seem to be 
exalting my own profession out of an excessive partiality for ancient 
precedent. At the same time I thought that any influence I possess ought not 
to be destroyed by incessant protests, wishing that it might remain 
unimpaired, should the State ever need my counsels. Today this has come to 
pass, since an ex-consul has been murdered in his house by the treachery of 
slaves, which not one hindered or divulged, though the Senate's decree, 
which threatens the entire slave-establishment with execution, has been till 
now unshaken. Vote impunity, in heaven's name, and then who will be 
protected by his rank, when the prefecture of the capital has

been of no avail to its holder? Who will be kept safe by the number 
of his slaves when four hundred have not protected <name type="person">Pedanius Secundus</name>? Which 
of us will be rescued by his domestics, who, even with the dread of 
punishment before them, regard not our dangers? Was the murderer, as some do 
not blush to pretend, avenging his wrongs because he had bargained about 
money from his father or because a family-slave was taken from him? Let us 
actually decide that the master was justly slain.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>"Is it your pleasure to search for arguments in a matter already 
weighed in the deliberations of wiser men than ourselves? Even if we had now 
for the first time to come to a decision, do you believe that a slave took 
courage to murder his master without letting fall a threatening word or 
uttering a rash syllable? Granted that he concealed his purpose, that he 
procured his weapon without his fellows' knowledge. Could he pass the 
night-guard, could he open the doors of the chamber, carry in a light, and 
accomplish the murder, while all were in ignorance? There are many 
preliminaries to guilt; if these are divulged by slaves, we may live singly 
amid numbers, safe among a trembling throng; lastly, if we must perish, it 
will be with vengeance on the guilty. Our ancestors always suspected the 
temper of their slaves, even when they were born on the same estates, or in 
the same houses with themselves and thus inherited from their birth an 
affection for their masters. But now that we have in our households nations 
with different customs to our own, with a foreign worship or none at all, it 
is only by terror you can hold in such a motley rabble. But, it will be 
said, the innocent will perish. Well, even in a beaten army when every tenth 
man is felled by the club, the lot falls also on the brave. There is some 
injustice in every great precedent, which, though injurious to individuals, 
has its compensation in the public advantage."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>No one indeed dared singly to oppose the opinion of <name type="person">Cassius</name>, but 
clamorous voices rose in reply from all who pitied the number, age, or sex, 
as well as the undoubted innocence of the great majority. Still, the party 
which voted for their execution prevailed. But the sentence could not be 
obeyed in the face of a dense and threatening mob, with

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SLAVES OF MURDERED MAN EXECUTED</note>
stones and firebrands. 
Then the emperor reprimanded the people by edict, and lined with a force of 
soldiers the entire route by which the condemned had to be dragged to 
execution. <name type="person">Cingonius Varro</name> had proposed that even all the freedmen under the 
same roof should be transported from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. This the 
emperor forbade, as he did not wish an ancient custom, which mercy had not 
relaxed, to be strained with cruel rigour.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>During the same consulship, <name type="person">Tarquitius Priscus</name> was convicted of 
extortion on the prosecution of the <name type="ethnic">Bithynians</name>, to the great joy of the 
senators, who remembered that he had impeached <name type="person">Statilius</name>, his own proconsul. 
An assessment was made of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs> by <name type="person">Quintus Volusius</name>, 
<name type="person">Sextius Africanus</name>, and <name type="person">Trebellius Maximus</name>. There was a rivalry, on the score 
of rank, between <name type="person">Volusius</name> and <name type="person">Africanus</name>. While they both disdained 
<name type="person">Trebellius</name>, they raised him above themselves.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>In that year died <name type="person">Memmius Regulus</name>, who from his solid worth and 
consistency was as distinguished as it is possible to be under the shadow of 
an emperor's grandeur, so much so, in fact, that <name type="person">Nero</name> when he was ill, with 
flatterers round him, who said that if aught befell him in the course of 
destiny, there must be an end of the empire, replied that the State had a 
resource, and on their asking where it was specially to be found, he added, 
"in <name type="person">Memmius Regulus</name>." Yet <name type="person">Regulus</name> lived after this, protected by his 
retiring habits, and by the fact that he was a man of newly-risen family and 
of wealth which did not provoke envy. <name type="person">Nero</name>, the same year, established a 
gymnasium, where oil was furnished to knights and senators after the lax 
fashion of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>In the 
consulship of <name type="person">Publius Marius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Asinius</name>, <name type="person">Antistius</name>, the 
pr&aelig;tor, whose lawless behaviour as tribune of the people I have 
mentioned, composed some libellous verses on the emperor, which he openly 
recited at a large gathering, when he was dining at the house of <name type="person">Ostorius 
Scapula</name>. He was upon this impeached of high treason by <name type="person">Cossutianus Capito</name>, 
who had lately been restored to a senator's rank on the intercession of his 
father-in-law, <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>. This was the first occasion on which the law of 
treason was revived, and men thought that it was not so much the ruin of 
<name type="person">Antistius</name> which was aimed at, as the glory of the emperor,

whose 
veto as tribune might save from death one whom the Senate had condemned. 
Though <name type="person">Ostorius</name> had stated that he had heard nothing as evidence, the 
adverse witnesses were believed, and <name type="person">Junius Marullus</name>, consul-elect, proposed 
that the accused should be deprived of his pr&aelig;torship, and be put to 
death in the ancient manner. The rest assented, and then <name type="person">P&aelig;tus 
Thrasea</name>, after much eulogy of <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, and most bitter censure of 
<name type="person">Antistius</name>, argued that it was not what a guilty prisoner might deserve to 
suffer, which ought to be decreed against him, under so excellent a prince, 
and by a Senate bound by no compulsion. "The executioner and the halter," he 
said, "we have long ago abolished; still, there are punishments ordained by 
the laws, which prescribe penalties, without judicial cruelty and disgrace 
to our age. Rather send him to some island, after confiscating his property; 
there, the longer he drags on his guilty life, the more wretched will he be 
personally, and the more conspicuous as an example of public 
clemency."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p><name type="person">Thrasea</name>'s freespokenness 
broke through the servility of the other senators. As soon as the consul 
allowed a division, they voted with him, with but few execeptions. Among 
these, the most enthusiastic in his flattery was <name type="person">Aulus Vitellius</name>, who 
attacked all the best men with abuse, and was silent when they replied, the 
usual way of a cowardly temper. The consuls, however, did not dare to ratify 
the Senate's vote, and simply communicated their unanimous resolution to the 
emperor. Hesitating for a while between shame and rage, he at last wrote to 
them in reply "that <name type="person">Antistius</name>, without having been provoked by any wrong, 
had uttered outrageous insults against the sovereign; that a demand for 
punishment had been submitted to the Senate, and that it was right that a 
penalty should be decreed proportioned to the offence; that for himself, 
inasmuch as he would have opposed severity in the sentence, he would not be 
an obstacle to leniency. They might determine as they pleased, and they had 
free liberty to acquit." </p>
<p>This and more to the same effect having been 
read out, clearly showing his displeasure, the consuls did not for that 
reason alter the terms of the motion, nor did <name type="person">Thrasea</name> withdraw his proposal, 
or the Senate reject what it had once

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">THRASEA'S BOLDNESS; 
DEATH OF BURRUS</note>
approved. Some were afraid of seeming to expose the 
emperor to odium; the majority felt safe in numbers, while <name type="person">Thrasea</name> was 
supported by his usual firmness of spirit, and a determination not to let 
his fame perish.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>A similar accusation 
caused the downfall of <name type="person">Fabricius Veiento</name>. He had composed many libels on 
senators and pontiffs in a work to which he gave the title of "Codicils." 
<name type="person">Talius Geminus</name>, the prosecutor, further stated that he had habitually 
trafficked in the emperor's favours and in the right of promotion. This was 
<name type="person">Nero</name>'s reason for himself undertaking the trial, and having convicted 
<name type="person">Veiento</name>, he banished him from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>, and ordered the 
burning of his books, which, while it was dangerous to procure them, were 
anxiously sought and much read. Soon full freedom for their possession 
caused their oblivion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>But while the 
miseries of the State were daily growing worse, its supports were becoming 
weaker. <name type="person">Burrus</name> died, whether from illness or from poison was a question. It 
was supposed to be illness from the fact that from the gradual swelling of 
his throat inwardly and the closing up of the passage he ceased to breathe. 
Many positively asserted that by <name type="person">Nero</name>'s order his throat was smeared with 
some poisonous drug under the pretence of the application of a remedy, and 
that <name type="person">Burrus</name>, who saw through the crime, when the emperor paid him a visit, 
recoiled with horror from his gaze, and merely replied to his question, "I 
indeed am well." <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> felt for him a deep and 
lasting regret, because of the remembrance of his worth, because too of the 
merely passive virtue of one of his successors and the very flagrant 
iniquities of the other. For the emperor had appointed two men to the 
command of the pr&aelig;torian cohorts, <name type="person">F&aelig;nius Rufus</name>, for a vulgar 
popularity, which he owed to his administration of the corn-supplies without 
profit to himself; and <name type="person">Sofonius Tigellinus</name>, whose inveterate shamelessness 
and infamy were an attraction to him. As might have been expected from their 
known characters, <name type="person">Tigellinus</name> had the greater influence with the prince, and 
was the associate of his most secret profligacy, while <name type="person">Rufus</name> enjoyed the 
favour of the people and of the soldiers, and this, he found, prejudiced him 
with <name type="person">Nero</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>The death of <name type="person">Burrus</name> was a 
blow to <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s power, for

virtue had not the same strength when 
one of its companions, so to say, was removed, and <name type="person">Nero</name> too began to lean on 
worse advisers. They assailed <name type="person">Seneca</name> with various charges, representing that 
he continued to increase a wealth which was already so vast as to be beyond 
the scale of a subject, and was drawing to himself the attachment of the 
citizens, while in the picturesqueness of his gardens and the magnificence 
of his country houses he almost surpassed the emperor. They further alleged 
against him that he claimed for himself alone the honours of eloquence, and 
composed poetry more assiduously, as soon as a passion for it had seized on 
<name type="person">Nero</name>. "Openly inimical to the prince's amusements, he disparaged his ability 
in driving horses, and ridiculed his voice whenever he sang. When was there 
to be an end of nothing being publicly admired but what <name type="person">Seneca</name> was thought 
to have originated? Surely <name type="person">Nero</name>'s boyhood was over, and he was all but in 
the prime of youthful manhood. He ought to shake off a tutor, furnished as 
he was with sufficiently noble instructors in his own ancestors."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p><name type="person">Seneca</name>, meanwhile, aware of these slanders, 
which were revealed to him by those who had some respect for merit, coupled 
with the fact that the emperor more and more shunned his intimacy, besought 
the opportunity of an interview. This was granted, and he spoke as 
follows:&mdash; </p>
<p>"It is fourteen years ago, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, that I was first 
associated with your prospects, and eight years since you have been emperor. 
In the interval, you have heaped on me such honours and riches that nothing 
is wanting to my happiness but a right use of it. I will refer to great 
examples taken not from my own but from your position. Your 
great-grandfather <name type="person">Augustus</name> granted to <name type="person">Marcus Agrippa</name> the calm repose of 
<rs type="placename">Mitylene</rs>, to <name type="person">Caius M&aelig;cenas</name> what was nearly equivalent to a foreign 
retreat in the capital itself. One of these men shared his wars; the other 
struggled with many laborious duties at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>; both 
received awards which were indeed splendid, but only proportioned to their 
great merits. For myself, what other recompense had I for your munificence, 
than a culture nursed, so to speak, in the shade of retirement, and to which 
a glory attaches itself, because I thus

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SENECA'S 
DEFENSE</note>
seem to have helped on the early training of your youth, an 
ample reward for the service. </p>
<p>"You on the other hand have surrounded me 
with vast influence and boundless wealth, so that I often think within 
myself, Am I, who am but of an equestrian and provincial family, numbered 
among the chief men of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>? Among nobles who can 
show a long succession of glories, has my new name become famous? Where is 
the mind once content with a humble lot? Is this the man who is building up 
his garden terraces, who paces grandly through these suburban parks, and 
revels in the affluence of such broad lands and such widely-spread 
investments? Only one apology occurs to me, that it would not have been 
right in me to have thwarted your bounty.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>"And yet we have both filled up our respective measures, you in 
giving as much as a prince can bestow on a friend, and I in receiving as 
much as a friend can receive from a prince. All else only fosters envy, 
which, like all things human, sinks powerless beneath your greatness, though 
on me it weighs heavily. To me relief is a necessity. Just as I should 
implore support if exhausted by warfare or travel, so in this journey of 
life, old as I am and unequal even to the lightest cares, since I cannot any 
longer bear the burden of my wealth, I crave assistance. Order my property 
to be managed by your agents and to be included in your estate. Still I 
shall not sink myself into poverty, but having surrendered the splendours 
which dazzle me, I will henceforth again devote to my mind all the leisure 
and attention now reserved for my gardens and country houses. You have yet 
before you a vigorous prime, and that on which for so many years your eyes 
were fixed, supreme power. We, your older friends, can answer for our quiet 
behaviour. It will likewise redound to your honour that you have raised to 
the highest places men who could also bear moderate fortune."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p><name type="person">Nero</name>'s reply was substantially this:&mdash;"My 
being able to meet your elaborate speech with an instant rejoinder is, I 
consider, primarily your gift, for you taught me how to express myself not 
only after reflection but at a moment's notice. My great-grandfather 
<name type="person">Augustus</name> allowed <name type="person">Agrippa</name> and <name type="person">M&aelig;cenas</name> to enjoy rest after their 
labours, but he did it at an

age carrying with it an authority 
sufficient to justify any boon, of any sort, he might have bestowed. But 
neither of them did he strip of the rewards he had given. It was by war and 
its perils they had earned them; for in these the youth of <name type="person">Augustus</name> was 
spent. And if I had passed my years in arms, your sword and right hand would 
not have failed me. But, as my actual condition required, you watched over 
my boyhood, then over my youth, with wisdom, counsel, and advice. And indeed 
your gifts to me will, as long as life holds out, be lasting possessions; 
those which you owe to me, your parks, investments, your country houses, are 
liable to accidents. Though they seem much, many far inferior to you in 
merit have obtained more. I am ashamed to quote the names of freedmen who 
parade a greater wealth. Hence I actually blush to think that, standing as 
you do first in my affections, you do not as yet surpass all in 
fortune.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p>"Yours too is a still 
vigorous manhood, quite equal to the labours of business and to the fruit of 
those labours; and, as for myself, I am but treading the threshold of 
empire. But perhaps you count yourself inferior to <name type="person">Vitellius</name>, thrice a 
consul, and me to <name type="person">Claudius</name>. Such wealth as long thrift has procured for 
<name type="person">Volusius</name>, my bounty, you think, cannot fully make up to you. Why not rather, 
if the frailty of my youth goes in any respect astray, call me back and 
guide yet more zealously with your help the manhood which you have 
instructed? It will not be your moderation, if you restore me your wealth, 
not your love of quiet, if you forsake your emperor, but my avarice, the 
fear of my cruelty, which will be in all men's mouths. Even if your 
self-control were praised to the utmost, still it would not be seemly in a 
wise man to get glory for himself in the very act of bringing disgrace on 
his friend." </p>
<p>To these words the emperor added embraces and kisses; for 
he was formed by nature and trained by habit to veil his hatred under 
delusive flattery. <name type="person">Seneca</name> thanked him, the usual end of an interview with a 
despot. But he entirely altered the practices of his former greatness; he 
kept the crowds of his visitors at a distance, avoided trains of followers, 
seldom appeared in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, as though weak health or 
philosophical studies detained him at home.</p></div2> 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SENECA 
RETIRES; RISE OF TIGELLINUS</note>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>When 
<name type="person">Seneca</name> had fallen, it was easy to shake the position of <name type="person">F&aelig;nius Rufus</name> 
by making <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s friendship a charge against him. <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, who was 
daily becoming more powerful and who thought that the wicked schemings which 
alone gave him strength, would be better liked if he could secure the 
emperor's complicity in guilt, dived into <name type="person">Nero</name>'s most secret apprehensions, 
and, as soon as he had ascertained that <name type="person">Plautus</name> and <name type="person">Sulla</name> were the men he 
most dreaded, <name type="person">Plautus</name> having been lately sent away to <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, <name type="person">Sulla</name> to <rs type="placename">Gallia 
Narbonensis</rs>, he spoke much of their noble rank and of their respective 
proximity to the armies of the East and of <rs type="placename">Germany</rs>. 
"I have no eye," he said, "like <name type="person">Burrus</name>, to two conflicting aims, but only to 
<name type="person">Nero</name>'s safety, which is at least secured against treachery in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> by my presence. As for distant commotions, how can 
they be checked? <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs> is roused at the name of the 
great dictator, and I distrust no less the nations of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, because of the renown of such a grandfather as 
<name type="person">Drusus</name>. <name type="person">Sulla</name> is poor, and hence comes his surpassing audacity; he shams 
apathy, while he is seeking an opening for his reckless ambition. <name type="person">Plautus</name> 
again, with his great wealth, does not so much as affect a love of repose, 
but he flaunts before us his imitations of the old <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, and assumes the 
self-consciousness of the Stoics along with a philosophy, which makes men 
restless, and eager for a busy life." </p>
<p>There was not a moment's delay. 
<name type="person">Sulla</name>, six days afterwards, was murdered by assassins brought over to <rs type="placename">Massilia</rs>, while he was reclining at the dinner-table, 
before he feared or heard of his danger. The head was taken to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and <name type="person">Nero</name> scoffed at its premature grey hairs as if 
they were a disfigurement.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>It was 
less of a secret that there was a design to murder <name type="person">Plautus</name>, as his life was 
dear to many. The distance too by land and sea, and the interval of time, 
had given rise to rumours, and the popular story was that he had tampered 
with <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, who was then at the head of great armies, and would be a 
special mark for danger, if illustrious and innocent men were to be 
destroyed. Again <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, it was said, from its 
partiality for the young man, had taken up arms, and the soldiers sent to do 
the crime, not being suf-

ficient in number or decided in 
purpose, and, finding themselves unable to execute their orders, had gone 
over to the new cause. These absurdities, like all popular gossip, gathered 
strength from the idle leisure of a credulous society. </p><p>As it was, one of 
<name type="person">Plautus</name>'s freedmen, thanks to swift winds, arrived before the centurion and 
brought him a message from his father-in-law, <name type="person">Lucius Antistius</name>. "He was to 
avoid the obvious refuge of a coward's death, and in the pity felt for a 
noble name he would soon find good men to help him, and daring spirits would 
rally round him. Meantime no resource was to be rejected. If he did but 
repel sixty soldiers (this was the number on the way), while tidings were 
being carried back to <name type="person">Nero</name>, while another force was on its march, many 
events would follow which would ripen into war. Finally, by this plan he 
either secured safety, or he would suffer nothing worse by daring than by 
cowardice."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>But all this had no 
effect on <name type="person">Plautus</name>. Either he saw no resource before him, an unarmed exile as 
he was, or he was weary of an uncertain hope, or was swayed by his love of 
his wife and of his children, to whom he thought the emperor, if harassed by 
no anxiety, would be more merciful. Some say that another message came to 
him from his father-in-law, representing that no dreadful peril hung over 
him, and that two teachers of philosophy, <name type="person">C&oelig;ranus</name> from <rs type="placename">Greece</rs> and <name type="person">Musonius</name> from <rs type="placename">Etruria</rs>, advised him to await death with firmness rather 
than lead a precarious and anxious life. At all events, he was surprised at 
midday, when stripped for exercise. In that state the centurion slew him in 
the presence of <name type="person">Pelago</name>, an eunuch, whom <name type="person">Nero</name> had set over the centurion and 
his company, like a despot's minister over his satellites. </p>
<p>The head of 
the murdered man was brought to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. At its sight 
the emperor exclaimed (I give his very words), "Why would you have been a 
<name type="person">Nero</name>?" Then casting off all fear he prepared to hurry on his marriage with 
<name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>, hitherto deferred because of such alarms as I have described, 
and to divorce his wife <name type="person">Octavia</name>, notwithstanding her virtuous life, because 
her father's name and the people's affection for her made her an offence to 
him. He wrote, however, a letter to the Senate, confessing nothing about the 
murders of <name type="person">Sulla</name> and <name type="person">Plautus</name>, but merely hinting that both
 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO DIVORCES OCTAVIA, MARRIES POPP&AElig;A</note>
had a restless 
temper, and that he gave the most anxious thought to the safety of the 
State. On this pretext a thanksgiving was decreed, and also the expulsion 
from the Senate of <name type="person">Sulla</name> and <name type="person">Plautus</name>, more grievous, however, as a farce 
than as an actual calamity.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p><name type="person">Nero</name>, on 
receiving this decree of the Senate and seeing that every piece of his 
wickedness was regarded as a conspicuous merit, drove <name type="person">Octavia</name> from him, 
alleging that she was barren, and then married <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>. The woman who 
had long been <name type="person">Nero</name>'s mistress and ruled him first as a paramour, then as her 
husband, instigated one of <name type="person">Octavia</name>'s servants to accuse her of an intrigue 
with a slave. The man fixed on as the guilty lover was one by name 
<name type="person">Euc&aelig;rus</name>, an <name type="ethnic">Alexandrine</name> by birth, skilled in singing to the flute. As 
a consequence, her slave-girls were examined under torture, and though some 
were forced by the intensity of agony into admitting falsehoods, most of 
them persisted in upholding the virtue of their mistress. One of them said, 
in answer to the furious menaces of <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, that <name type="person">Octavia</name>'s person was 
purer than his mouth. <name type="person">Octavia</name>, however, was dismissed under the form of an 
ordinary divorce, and received possession of the house of <name type="person">Burrus</name> and of the 
estates of <name type="person">Plautus</name>, an ill-starred gift. She was soon afterwards banished to 
<rs type="placename">Campania</rs> under military surveillance. This led to 
incessant and outspoken remonstrances among the common people, who have less 
discretion and are exposed to fewer dangers than others from the 
insignificance of their position. Upon this <name type="person">Nero</name>, though he did not repent 
of his outrage, restored to <name type="person">Octavia</name> her position as wife.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>Then people in their joy went up to the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs> 
and, at last, gave thanks to the gods. They threw down the statues of 
<name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>; they bore on their shoulders the images of <name type="person">Octavia</name>, covering 
them with flowers, and setting them up in the forum and in the temples. 
There was even a burst of applause for the emperor, men hailing the recalled 
<name type="person">Octavia</name>. And now they were pouring into the <rs type="placename">Palace</rs> in crowds, with loud 
shoutings, when some companies of soldiers rushed out and dispersed the 
tumultuous throng with blows, and at the point of the sword. Whatever 
changes had been made in the riot, were reversed, and <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>'s honours 
restored.

Ever relentless in her hatred, she was now enraged by 
the fear that either the violence of the mob would burst on her with yet 
fiercer fury, or that <name type="person">Nero</name> would be swayed by the popular bias, and so, 
flinging herself at his knees, she exclaimed that she was not in the 
position of a rival fighting for marriage, though that was dearer to her 
than life, but that her very life was brought into jeopardy by the 
dependants and slaves of <name type="person">Octavia</name>, who had assumed the name of the people, 
and dared in peace what could hardly happen in war. "Those arms," she said, 
"have been taken up against the emperor; a leader only is wanting, and he 
will easily be found in a commotion. Only let her whose mere beck, though 
she is far away, stirs up tumult, quit <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>, and 
make her way in person to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. And, again, what is 
my sin? What offence have I caused any one? Is it that I am about to give to 
the house of the C&aelig;sars a lawful heir? Do the people of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> prefer that the offspring of an Egyptian 
flute-player should be raised to the imperial throne? In a word, if it be 
expedient, <name type="person">Nero</name> should of his own choice rather than on compulsion send for 
her who ruled him, or else secure his safety by a righteous vengeance. The 
beginning of a commotion has often been quieted by slight precautions; but 
if people once despair of <name type="person">Octavia</name> being <name type="person">Nero</name>'s wife, they will soon find her 
a husband."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>Her various arguments, 
tending both to frighten and to enrage, at once alarmed and incensed her 
listener. But the suspicion about the slave was of little weight, and the 
torture of the slave-girls exposed its absurdity. Consequently it was 
decided to procure a confession from some one on whom could also be fastened 
a charge of revolutionary designs. Fittest for this seemed the perpetrator 
of the mother's murder, <name type="person">Anicetus</name>, commander, as I have already mentioned, of 
the fleet at <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs>, who got but scant gratitude 
after that atrocious deed, and subsequently all the more vehement hatred, 
inasmuch as men look on their instruments in crime as a sort of standing 
reproach to them. </p>
<p>The emperor accordingly sent for <name type="person">Anicetus</name>, and 
reminded him of his former service. "He alone," he said, "had come to the 
rescue of the prince's life against a plotting mother. Close at hand was a 
chance of winning no less gratitude by

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">OCTAVIA'S BANISHMENT 
AND DEATH</note>
ridding him of a malignant wife. No violence or weapons 
were needed; only let him confess to an intrigue with <name type="person">Octavia</name>." <name type="person">Nero</name> then 
promised him a secret but ample immediate recompense, and some delightful 
retreat, while he threatened him with death in case of refusal. <name type="person">Anicetus</name>, 
with the moral insensibility of his nature and a promptness inspired by 
previous atrocities, invented even more than was required of him, and 
confessed before friends whom the prince had called in, as a sort of 
judicial council. He was then banished to <rs type="placename">Sardinia</rs>, 
where he endured exile without poverty, and died a natural death.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> meanwhile declared by edict that the 
prefect had been corrupted into a design of gaining over the fleet, and 
added, in forgetfulness of his late charge of barrenness against <name type="person">Octavia</name>, 
that, conscious of her profligacies, she had procured abortion, a fact he 
had himself ascertained. Then he confined her in the island of <rs type="placename">Pandataria</rs>. No exile ever filled the eyes of beholders 
with tears of greater compassion. Some still remembered <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, banished 
by <name type="person">Tiberius</name>, and the yet fresher memory of <name type="person">Julia</name>, whom <name type="person">Claudius</name> exiled, was 
present to men's thoughts. But they had life's prime for their stay; they 
had seen some happiness, and the horror of the moment was alleviated by 
recollections of a better lot in the past. For <name type="person">Octavia</name>, from the first, her 
marriage-day was a kind of funeral, brought, as she was, into a house where 
she had nothing but scenes of mourning, her father and, an instant 
afterwards, her brother, having been snatched from her by poison; then, a 
slave-girl raised above the mistress; <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> married only to insure a 
wife's ruin, and, to end all, an accusation more horrible than any 
death.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>And now the girl, in her 
twentieth year, with centurions and soldiers around her, already removed 
from among the living by the forecast of doom, still could not reconcile 
herself to death. After an interval of a few days, she received an order 
that she was to die, although she protested that she was now a widow and 
only a sister, and appealed to their common ancestors, the Germanici, and 
finally to the name of <name type="person">Agrippina</name>, during whose life she had endured a 
marriage, which was miserable enough indeed, but not fatal. She was then 
tightly bound with cords, and the veins

of every limb were 
opened; but as her blood was congealed by terror and flowed too slowly, she 
was killed outright by the steam of an intensely hot bath. To this was added 
the yet more appalling horror of <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> beholding the severed head 
which was conveyed to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. </p>
<p>And for all this 
offerings were voted to the temples. I record the fact with a special 
object. Whoever would study the calamities of that period in my pages or 
those of other authors, is to take it for granted that as often as the 
emperor directed banishments or executions, so often was there a 
thanksgiving to the gods, and what formerly commemorated some prosperous 
event, was then a token of public disaster. Still, if any decree of the 
Senate was marked by some new flattery, or by the lowest servility, I shall 
not pass it over in silence.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>That 
same year <name type="person">Nero</name> was believed to have destroyed by poison two of his most 
powerful freedmen, <name type="person">Doryphorus</name>, on the pretext of his having opposed the 
marriage with <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>, <name type="person">Pallas</name> for still keeping his boundless wealth by 
a prolonged old age. <name type="person">Romanus</name> had accused <name type="person">Seneca</name> in stealthy calumnies, of 
having been an accomplice of <name type="person">Caius Piso</name>, but he was himself crushed more 
effectually by <name type="person">Seneca</name> on the same charge. This alarmed <name type="person">Piso</name>, and gave rise 
to a huge fabric of unsuccessful conspiracies against <name type="person">Nero</name>.</p></div2></div1>

<name type="person">Corbulo</name>'s achievements and of a foreign prince, <name type="person">Tigranes</name>, having been set 
over <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, though he longed at the same time to 
avenge the majesty of the Arsacids, which had been insulted by the expulsion 
of his brother <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, was, on the other hand, drawn to different 
thoughts as he reflected on the greatness of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, 
and felt reverence for a hitherto unbroken treaty. Naturally irresolute, he 
was now hampered by a revolt of the <name type="ethnic">Hyrcanians</name>, a powerful tribe, and by 
several wars arising out of it. Suddenly, as he was wavering, fresh and 
further tidings of disgrace goaded him to action. <name type="person">Tigranes</name>, quitting <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, had ravaged the <name type="ethnic">Adiabeni</name>, a people on its 
border, too extensively and continuously for mere plundering raids. The 
chief men of the tribes were indignant at having fallen into such contempt 
that they were victims to the inroads, not indeed of a Roman general, but of 
a daring hostage, who for so many years had been numbered among slaves. 
Their anger was inflamed by <name type="person">Monobazus</name>, who ruled the <name type="ethnic">Adiabeni</name>, and 
repeatedly asked what protection he was to seek and from what 
quarter&mdash;"Already," he said, "<rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> has been 
given up, and its borders are being wrested from us, and unless the 
<name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> help us, we shall find that subjection to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> is lighter for those who surrender than for the 
conquered." <name type="person">Tiridates</name> too, exile as he was from his kingdom, by his silence 
or very moderate complaints made the deeper impression. "It is not," he 
urged, "by weak inaction that great empires are held together; there must be 
the struggle of brave men in arms; might is right with those who are at the 
summit of power. And though it is the glory of a private house to keep 
its

own, it is the glory of a king to fight for the possessions 
of others."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>Moved by these 
considerations <name type="person">Vologeses</name> called a council, placed <name type="person">Tiridates</name> by his side, and 
began to speak as follows:&mdash; </p>
<p>"This man before you, born from the 
same father as myself, having waived in my favour, on the ground of age, the 
highest title of all, was established by me in the possession of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, which is accounted the third grade of power. As 
for <rs type="placename">Media</rs>, <name type="person">Pacorus</name> was already in possession of it. 
And I thought to myself that I had duly arranged our family and home so as 
to guard against the old feuds and rivalries of brothers. The <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> thwart 
me, and though they have never with success to themselves disturbed the 
peace between us, they are now again breaking it to their own destruction. I 
will not attempt to deny one thing. It was by just dealing rather than by 
bloodshed, by having a good cause rather than by arms, that I had wished to 
retain what my ancestors had won. If I have sinned through irresolution, my 
valour shall make amends for it. Assuredly your strength and renown are at 
their height, and you have in addition the repute of obedience, which the 
greatest of mortals must not despise, and which the gods highly esteem."

<p>As he spoke, he encircled <name type="person">Tiridates</name>' brow with a diadem, and to <name type="person">Moneses</name>, 
a noble, he entrusted a highly efficient body of cavalry, which was the 
king's customary escort, giving him also some auxiliaries from the <name type="ethnic">Adiabeni</name>, 
and orders that <name type="person">Tigranes</name> was to be driven out of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>. He would himself abandon his feud with the 
<name type="ethnic">Hyrcanians</name>, and raise his own national force in all its warlike strength by 
way of menace to the Roman provinces.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>When <name type="person">Corbulo</name> had heard all this from messengers he could trust, he sent two 
legions under <name type="person">Verulanus Severus</name> and <name type="person">Vettius Bolanus</name> to the support of 
<name type="person">Tigranes</name>, with secret instructions that they were to conduct all their 
operations with deliberation rather than despatch, as he would prefer to 
sustain rather than to make war. And indeed he had written to the emperor 
that a general was wanted specially for the defence of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, and that <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, 
threatened as it was by <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, was in yet more imminent peril. Mean-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CORBULO AND PARTHIAN WAR</note>
while he posted his remaining 
legions on the bank of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, armed a 
hastily collected force of provincials, and occupied with troops the enemy's 
approaches. And as the country was deficient in water, he established forts 
to guard the wells, and concealed some of the streams with heaps of 
sand.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>While <name type="person">Corbulo</name> was thus preparing 
for the defence of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, <name type="person">Moneses</name> rapidly pushed on 
his forces to anticipate the rumour of his advance, but he did not any the 
more find <name type="person">Tigranes</name> unaware of or unprepared for his movement. He had, in 
fact, occupied <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs>, a city strong from the 
multitude of its defenders and the vastness of its fortifications. In 
addition, the river <rs type="placename">Nicephorius</rs>, the breadth of 
which is far from contemptible, circled a portion of its walls, and a wide 
fosse was drawn where they distrusted the protection of the stream. There 
were some soldiers too, and supplies previously provided. In the conveyance 
of these a few men had hurried on too eagerly, and, having been surprised by 
a sudden attack from the enemy, had inspired their comrades with rage rather 
than fear. But the <name type="ethnic">Parthian</name> has not the daring in close combat needed for a 
successful siege. His thin showers of arrows do not alarm men within walls, 
and only disappoint himself. The <name type="ethnic">Adiabeni</name>, when they began to advance their 
scaling ladders and engines, were easily driven back, and then cut down by a 
sally of our men.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name>, however, 
notwithstanding his successes, thought he must use his good fortune with 
moderation, and sent <name type="person">Vologeses</name> a message of remonstrance against the 
violence done to a Roman province, and the blockade of an allied and 
friendly king and of Roman cohorts. "He had better give up the siege, or he, 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name> too would encamp in his territory, as on hostile ground." <name type="person">Casperius</name>, 
a centurion selected for this mission, had an interview with the king at the 
town <rs type="placename">Nisibis</rs>, thirty-seven miles distant from <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs>, and with fearless spirit announced his 
message. With <name type="person">Vologeses</name> it was an old and deep conviction that he should 
shun the arms of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Nor was the present going 
smoothly with him. The siege was a failure; <name type="person">Tigranes</name> was safe with his 
troops and supplies; those who had under-

taken the storming of 
the place had been routed; legions had been sent into <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, and other legions were ready to rush to the 
attack on behalf of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, while his own cavalry was 
crippled by want of food. A host of locusts, suddenly appearing, had 
devoured every blade of grass and every leaf. And so, hiding his fear and 
presenting a more conciliatory attitude, he replied that he would send 
envoys to the Roman emperor for the possession of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> and the conclusion of a lasting peace. He 
ordered <name type="person">Moneses</name> to leave <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs>, while he 
himself retired.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>Many spoke highly of 
these results, as due to the king's alarm and the threats of <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, and as 
splendid successes. Others explained them as a secret understanding that 
with the cessation of war on both sides and the departure of <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, 
<name type="person">Tigranes</name> also was to quit <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>. "Why," it was 
asked, "had the Roman army been withdrawn from <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs>? Why had they abandoned in peace what they 
had defended in war? Was it better for them to have wintered on the confines 
of <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs> in hastily constructed huts, than in 
the capital of a kingdom lately recovered?" There had been, in short, a 
suspension of arms, in order that <name type="person">Vologeses</name> might fight some other foe than 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name>, and that <name type="person">Corbulo</name> might not further risk the glory he had earned in 
so many years. For, as I have related, he had asked for a general 
exclusively for the defence of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, and it was 
heard that <name type="person">C&aelig;sennius P&aelig;tus</name> was on his way. And indeed he had now 
arrived, and the army was thus divided; the fourth and twelfth legions, with 
the fifth which had lately been raised in <rs type="placename">M&oelig;sia</rs> and the auxiliaries from <rs type="placename">Pontus</rs>, <rs type="placename">Galatia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs>, were under the command of <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>, while 
the third, sixth, and tenth legions and the old soldiery of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> remained with <name type="person">Corbulo</name>. All else they were to share 
or divide between them according to circumstances. But as <name type="person">Corbulo</name> could not 
endure a rival, so <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>, who would have been sufficiently honoured by 
ranking second to him, disparaged the results of the war, and said 
repeatedly that there had been no bloodshed or spoil, that the sieges of 
cities were sieges only in name, and that he would soon impose on the 
conquered tribute and laws and Roman administration, instead of the empty 
shadow of a king.</p></div2>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">P&AElig;TUS TO DEFENSE OF <rs type="placename">ARMENIA</rs></note>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>About the 
same time the envoys of <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, who had been sent, as I have related, to 
the emperor, returned without success, and the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> made open war. Nor 
did <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> decline the challenge, but with two legions, the 4th and 
12th, the first of which was then commanded by <name type="person">Funisulanus Vettonianus</name> and 
the second by <name type="person">Calavius Sabinus</name>, entered <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, 
with unlucky omen. In the passage of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, 
which they crossed by a bridge, a horse which carried the consul's official 
emblems, took fright without any apparent cause and fled to the rear. A 
victim, too, standing by some of the winter-tents, which were being 
fortified, broke its way through them, when the work was but half finished, 
and got clear out of the entrenchments. Then again the soldiers' javelins 
gleamed with light, a prodigy the more significant because the Parthian foe 
fights with missiles.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p><name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>, 
however, despising omens, before he had yet thoroughly fortified his 
winter-camp or provided for his corn supply, hurried his army across <rs type="placename">Mount Taurus</rs>, for the recovery, as he gave out, of <rs type="placename">Tigranocerta</rs> and the ravaging of the country which 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name> had left untouched. Some forts too were taken, and some glory as 
well as plunder had been secured, if only he had enjoyed his glory modestly, 
and his plunder with vigilance. While he was overrunning in tedious 
expeditions districts which could not be held, the supplies which had been 
captured, were spoilt, and as winter was now at hand, he led back his army 
and wrote a letter to the emperor, as if the war was finished, in pompous 
language, but barren of facts.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Meanwhile <name type="person">Corbulo</name> occupied the bank of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, which he had never neglected, with troops at 
closer intervals. That he might have no hindrance in throwing a bridge over 
it from the enemy's cavalry, which was already scouring the adjoining plains 
with a formidable display, he launched on the river some vessels of 
remarkable size, linked together by beams, with towers rising from their 
decks, and with catapults and balistas he drove off the barbarians. The 
stones and spears penetrated their host at a range beyond the reach of the 
opposing volleys of arrows. The bridge was then completed, and the hills 
facing us were occupied by our auxiliary infantry, then, by the 
entrenchments of the

legions, with such rapidity and such a 
display of force that the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, giving up their preparations for the 
invasion of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, concentrated all their hopes on 
<rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p><name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>, ignorant of the impending danger, was keeping the 5th legion at 
a distance in <rs type="placename">Pontus</rs>; the rest he had weakened by 
indiscriminate furloughs, till it was heard that <name type="person">Vologeses</name> was approaching 
with a powerful force bent on war. He summoned the 12th legion, and then was 
discovered the numerical feebleness of the source from which he had hoped 
for the repute of an augmented army. Yet even thus the camp might have been 
held, and the Parthian foe baffled, by protracting the war, had <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> 
stood firm either by his own counsels or by those of others. But though 
military men had put him on his guard against imminent disasters, still, not 
wishing to seem to need the advice of others, he would fall back on some 
quite different and inferior plan. So now, leaving his winter quarters, and 
exclaiming that not the fosse or the rampart, but the men's bodies and 
weapons were given him for facing the foe, he led out his legions, as if he 
meant to fight a battle. Then, after losing a centurion and a few soldiers 
whom lie had sent on in advance to reconnoitre the enemy's forces, he 
returned in alarm. And, as <name type="person">Vologeses</name> had not pressed his advantage with much 
vigour, <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> once again, with vain confidence, posted 3000 chosen 
infantry on the adjacent ridge of the <rs type="placename">Taurus</rs>, in 
order to bar the king's passage. He also stationed some Pannonian troopers, 
the flower of his cavalry, in a part of the plain. His wife and son he 
removed to a fortress named <rs type="placename">Arsamosata</rs>, with a cohort for their defence, 
thus dispersing the troops which, if kept together, could easily have 
checked the desultory skirmishing of the enemy. He could, it is said, 
scarcely be driven to confess to <name type="person">Corbulo</name> how the enemy was pressing him. 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name> made no haste, that, when the dangers thickened, the glory of the 
rescue might be enhanced. Yet he ordered 1000 men from each of his three 
legions with 800 cavalry, and an equal number of infantry to be in instant 
readiness.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p><name type="person">Vologeses</name> meanwhile, 
though he had heard that the roads were blocked by <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>, here with 
infantry, there with cavalry, did not alter his plan, but drove off the 
latter by

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">P&AElig;TUS DEFEATED, ASKS CORBULO'S 
HELP</note>
the menace of an attack, and crushed the legionaires, only one 
centurion of whom, <name type="person">Tarquitius Crescens</name>, dared to defend a tower in which he 
was keeping guard. He had often sallied out, and cut to pieces such of the 
barbarians as came close up to the walls, till he was overwhelmed with 
volleys of firebrands. Every foot soldier still unwounded fled to remote 
wilds, and those who were disabled, returned to the camp, exaggerating in 
their terror the king's valour, and the warlike strength of his tribes, 
everything in short, to the simple credulity of those who trembled with like 
fear. Even the general did not struggle against his reverses. He had indeed 
wholly abandoned all the duties of a soldier, and had again sent an entreaty 
to <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, that he would come with speed to save the standards and eagles, 
and the name yet left to the unfortunate army; they meantime, he said, would 
hold to their fidelity while life lasted.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name>, perfectly fearless, left half his army in <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> to retain the forts built on the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, and taking the nearest route, which also was 
not deficient in supplies, marched through the country of <rs type="placename">Commagene</rs>, then through <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs>, and thence into <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>. Beside the other usual accompaniments of war, 
his army was followed by a great number of camels laden with corn, to keep 
off famine as well as the enemy. The first he met of the defeated army was 
<name type="person">Paccius</name>, a first-rank centurion, then many of the soldiers, whom, when they 
pleaded various excuses for flight, he advised to return to their standards 
and throw themselves on the mercy of <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>. "For himself," he said, 
"he had no forgiveness but for the victorious." </p>
<p>As he spoke, he went up 
to his legions, cheering them and reminding them of their past career, and 
pointing the way to new glory. "It was not to villages or towns of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, but to a Roman camp with two legions, a worthy 
recompense for their efforts, that they were bound. If each common soldier 
were to have bestowed on him by the emperor's hand the special honour of a 
crown for a rescued citizen, how wonderfully great the glory, when the 
numbers would be equal of those who had brought and of those who had 
received deliverance." Roused by these and like words into a common 
enthusiasm, and some too were filled with an ardour

peculiarly 
their own by the perils of brothers and kinsfolk, they hurried on by day and 
night their uninterrupted march.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>All 
the more vigorously did <name type="person">Vologeses</name> press the besieged, now attacking the 
legions' entrenchments, and now again the fortress, which guarded those 
whose years unfitted them for war. He advanced closer than is the Parthian 
practice, seeking to lure the enemy to an engagement by such rashness. They, 
however, could hardly be dragged out of their tents, and would merely defend 
their lives, some held back by the general's order, others by their own 
cowardice; they seemed to be awaiting <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, and should they be 
overpowered by force, they had before them the examples of <rs type="placename">Candium</rs> and <rs type="placename">Numantia</rs>. "Neither the <name type="ethnic">Samnites</name>, Italian people as they 
were, nor the <name type="ethnic">Carthaginians</name>, the rivals of the Roman empire, were, it 
seemed, equally formidable, and even the men of old, with all their strength 
and glory, whenever fortune was adverse, had taken thought for safety." 
</p>
<p>The general, although he was overcome by the despair of his army, first 
wrote a letter to <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, not a suppliant petition, but in a tone of 
remonstrance against the doing of hostile acts on behalf of the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name>, 
who always had been under Roman dominion, or subject to a king chosen by the 
emperor. Peace, he reminded him, was equally for the interest of both, and 
it would be well for him not to look only at the present. He indeed had 
advanced with the whole strength of his kingdom against two legions, while 
the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had all the rest of the world with which to sustain the 
war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>To this <name type="person">Vologeses</name> replied 
nothing to the purpose, but merely that he must wait for his brothers 
<name type="person">Pacorus</name> and <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, that the place and time of their meeting had been 
fixed on as the occasion when they would decide about <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, and that heaven had granted them a further 
honour, well worthy of the Arsacids, the having to determine the fate of 
Roman legions. Messengers were then despatched by <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>, and an 
interview requested with the king, who ordered <name type="person">Vasaces</name>, the commander of the 
cavalry, to go. Thereupon <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> dwelt on the memories of the Luculli 
and <placeName key="tgn,7004658">Pompeii</placeName>, and of all that the C&aelig;sars had done in the way of holding 
or giving away <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, while <name type="person">Vasaces</name> declared that 
we

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">P&AElig;TUS' LEGIONS HUMILIATED</note>
had the mere 
shadow of possession and of bestowing, but the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, the reality of 
power. After much arguing on both sides, <name type="person">Monobazus</name> of the <name type="ethnic">Adiabeni</name> was 
called the next day to be a witness to the stipulations into which they had 
entered. It was agreed that the legions should be released from the 
blockade, that a the troops should quit Armenian territory, and that the 
forts and supplies should be surrendered to the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, and when all this 
had been completed, <name type="person">Vologeses</name> was to have full permission to send envoys to 
<name type="person">Nero</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>Meanwhile <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> threw a 
bridge over the river <rs type="placename">Arsanias</rs>, which flowed by the 
camp, apparently with the view of facilitating his march. It was the 
<name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, however, who had required this, as an evidence of their victory; 
for the bridge was of use to them, while our men went a different way. 
Rumour added that the legions had been passed under the yoke, with other 
miserable disgraces, of which the <name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> had borrowed imitations. For 
they not only entered our lines before the Roman army began to retire, but 
also stood about the camp streets, recognizing and dragging off slaves or 
beasts of burden which we had previously captured. They even seized clothes 
and detained weapons, for the soldiers were utterly cowed and gave up 
everything, so that no cause for fighting might arise. <name type="person">Vologeses</name> having 
piled up the arms and bodies of the slain in order to attest our defeat, 
refrained from gazing on the fugitive legions. He sought a character for 
moderation after he had glutted his pride. Seated himself on an elephant, he 
crossed the river <rs type="placename">Arsanias</rs>, while those next to his 
person rushed through it at the utmost speed of their horses; for a rumour 
had gained ground that the bridge would give way, through the trickery of 
its builders. But those who ventured to go on it found it to be firm and 
trustworthy.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>As for the besieged, it 
appeared that they had such an abundance of corn that they fired the 
granaries, and <name type="person">Corbulo</name> declared that the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name> on the other hand were in 
want of supplies, and would have abandoned the siege from their fodder being 
all but exhausted, and that he was himself only three days' march distant. 
He further stated that <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> had guaranteed by an oath, before the 
standards,

in the presence of those whom the king had sent to be 
witnesses, that no <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> was to enter <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> until 
<name type="person">Nero</name>'s reply arrived as to whether he assented to the peace. Though this may 
have been invented to enhance our disgrace, yet about the rest of the story 
there is no obscurity, that, in a single day <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> traversed forty 
miles, leaving his wounded behind him everywhere, and that the consternation 
of the fugitives was as frightful as if they had turned their backs in 
battle. <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, as he met them with his forces on the bank of the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, did not make such a display of his standards 
and arms as to shame them by the contrast. His men, in their grief and pity 
for the lot of their comrades, could not even refrain from tears. There was 
scarce any mutual salutation for weeping. The spirit of a noble rivalry and 
the desire of glory, emotions which stir men in success, had died away; pity 
alone survived, the more strongly in the inferior ranks.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>Then followed a short conversation between the 
generals. While <name type="person">Corbulo</name> complained that his efforts had been fruitless and 
that the war might have been ended with the flight of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, 
<name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> replied that for neither of them was anything lost, and urged 
that they should reverse the eagles, and with their united forces invade <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, much weakened, as it was, by the departure of 
<name type="person">Vologeses</name>. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> said that he had no such instructions from the emperor; 
it was the peril of the legions which had stirred him to leave his province, 
and, as there was uncertainty about the designs of the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, he should 
return to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs>, and, even as it was, he must pray 
for fortune under her most favourable aspect in order that the infantry, 
wearied out with long marches, might keep pace with the enemy's untiring 
cavalry, certain to outstrip him on the plains, which facilitated their 
movements. <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> then went into winter quarters in <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs>. <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, however, sent a message to 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name>, requiring him to remove the fortresses on the further bank of the 
<rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>, and to leave the river to be, as 
formerly, the boundary between them. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> also demanded the evacuation of 
<rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> by the garrisons posted throughout it. At 
last the king yielded, all the positions

<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><rs type="placename">EUPHRATES</rs> ROMAN-PARTHIAN BOUNDARY</note>
fortified by 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name> beyond the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs> were destroyed, and the 
<name type="ethnic">Armenians</name> too left without a master.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>At <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile trophies for the Parthian war, and 
arches were erected in the centre of the <rs type="placename">Capitoline</rs> 
hill; these had been decreed by the Senate, while the war was yet undecided, 
and even now they were not given up, appearances being consulted, in 
disregard of known facts. And to hide his anxious fears about foreign 
affairs, <name type="person">Nero</name> threw the people's corn, which was so old as to be spoilt, 
into the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, with the view of keeping up a sense 
of security about the supplies. There was no addition to the price, although 
about two hundred ships were destroyed in the very harbour by a violent 
storm, and one hundred more, which had sailed up the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, by an accidental fire. <name type="person">Nero</name> next appointed three 
ex-consuls, <name type="person">Lucius Piso</name>, <name type="person">Ducennius Geminus</name>, and <name type="person">Pompeius Paulinus</name>, to the 
management of the public revenues, and inveighed at the same time against 
former emperors whose heavy expenditure had exceeded their legitimate 
income. He himself, he said, made the state an annual present of sixty 
million sesterces.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>A very 
demoralizing custom had at this time become rife, of fictitious adoptions of 
children, on the eve of the elections or of the assignment of the provinces, 
by a number of childless persons, who, after obtaining along with real 
fathers pr&aelig;torships and provinces, forthwith dismissed from paternal 
control the sons whom they had adopted. An appeal was made to the Senate 
under a keen sense of wrong. Parents pleaded natural rights and the 
anxieties of nurture against fraudulent evasions and the brief ceremony of 
adoption. "It was," they argued, "sufficient reward for the childless to 
have influence and distinction, everything, in short, easy and open to them, 
without a care and without a burden. For themselves, they found that the 
promises held out by the laws, for which they had long waited, were turned 
into mockery, when one who knew nothing of a parent's solicitude or of the 
sorrows of bereavement could rise in a moment to the level of a father's 
long deferred hopes." </p>
<p>On this, a decree of the Senate was passed that a 
fictitious adoption should be of no avail in any department of the

public service, or even hold good for acquiring an 
inheritance.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>Next came the 
prosecution of <name type="person">Claudius Timarchus</name> of <rs type="placename">Crete</rs>, on such 
charges as often fall on very influential provincials, whom immense wealth 
has emboldened to the oppression of the weak. But one speech of his had gone 
to the extremity of a gross insult to the Senate; for he had repeatedly 
declared that it was in his power to decide whether the proconsuls who had 
governed <rs type="placename">Crete</rs> should receive the thanks of the 
province. <name type="person">P&aelig;tus Thrasea</name>, turning the occasion to public advantage, 
after having stated his opinion that the accused ought to be expelled from 
<rs type="placename">Crete</rs>, further spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is 
found by experience, Senators, that admirable laws and right precedents 
among the good have their origin in the misdeeds of others. Thus the license 
of advocates resulted in the Cincian bill; the corrupt practices of 
candidates, in the <placeName key="tgn,2089671">Julian</placeName> laws; the rapacity of magistrates, in the 
Calpurnian enactments. For, in point of time, guilt comes before punishment, 
and correction follows after delinquency. And therefore, to meet the new 
insolence of provincials, let us adopt a measure worthy of Roman good faith 
and resolution, whereby our allies may lose nothing of our protection, while 
public opinion may cease to say of us, that the estimate of a man's 
character is to be found anywhere rather than in the judgment of our 
citizens.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>"Formerly, it was not only 
a pr&aelig;tor or a consul, but private persons also, who were sent to 
inspect the provinces, and to report what they thought about each man's 
loyalty. And nations were timidly sensitive to the opinion of individuals. 
But now we court foreigners and flatter them, and just as there is a vote of 
thanks at any one's pleasure, so even more eagerly is a prosecution decided 
on. Well; let it be decided on, and let the provincials retain the right of 
showing their power in this fashion, but as for false praise which has been 
extorted by entreaties, let it be as much checked as fraud or tyranny. More 
faults are often committed, while we are trying to oblige than while we are 
giving offence. Nay, some virtues are actually hated; inflexible strictness, 
for example, and a temper proof against par-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">THRASEA ON 
PROVINCIAL ARROGANCE</note>
tiality. Consequently, our magistrates' early 
career is generally better than its close, which deteriorates, when we are 
anxiously seeking votes, like candidates. If such practices are stopped, our 
provinces will be ruled more equitably and more steadily. For as the dread 
of a charge of extortion has been a check to rapacity, so, by prohibiting 
the vote of thanks, will the pursuit of popularity be restrained."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>This opinion was hailed with great 
unanimity, but the Senate's resolution could not be finally passed, as the 
consuls decided that there had been no formal motion on the subject. Then, 
at the emperor's suggestion, they decreed that no one was to propose to any 
council of our allies that a vote of thanks ought to be given in the Senate 
to pro-pr&aelig;tors or pro-consuls, and that no one was to discharge such a 
mission. </p>
<p>During the same consulship a gymnasium was wholly consumed by a 
stroke of lightning, and a statue of <name type="person">Nero</name> within it was melted down to a 
shapeless mass of bronze. An earthquake too demolished a large part of <rs type="placename">Pompeii</rs>, a populous town in <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>. And one of the vestal virgins, <name type="person">L&aelig;lia</name>, 
died, and in her place was chosen <name type="person">Cornelia</name>, of the family of the 
Cossi.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>During the consulship of 
<name type="person">Memmius Regulus</name> and <name type="person">Verginius Rufus</name>, <name type="person">Nero</name> welcomed with something more than 
mortal joy the birth of a daughter by <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>, whom he called <name type="person">Augusta</name>, 
the same title having also been given to <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>. The place of her 
confinement was the colony of <rs type="placename">Antium</rs>, where the 
emperor himself was born. Already had the Senate commended <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>'s 
safety to the gods, and had made vows in the State's name, which were 
repeated again and again and duly discharged. To these was added a public 
thanksgiving, and a temple was decreed to the goddess of fecundity, as well 
as games and contests after the type of the ceremonies commemorative of <rs type="placename">Actium</rs>, and golden images of the two Fortunes were to be 
set up on the throne of <name type="person">Jupiter</name> of the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs>. Shows too of the circus were 
to be exhibited in honour of the Claudian and Domitian families at <rs type="placename">Antium</rs>, like those at <rs type="placename">Bovill&aelig;</rs> in commemoration of the Julii. Transient 
distinctions all of them, as within four months the infant died. Again there 
was an outburst of

flattery, men voting the honours of 
deification, of a shrine, a temple, and a priest. </p>
<p>The emperor, too, was 
as excessive in his grief as he had been in his joy. It was observed that 
when all the Senate rushed out to <rs type="placename">Antium</rs> to honour 
the recent birth, <name type="person">Thrasea</name> was forbidden to go, and received with fearless 
spirit an affront which foreboded his doom. Then followed, as rumour says, 
an expression from the emperor, in which he boasted to <name type="person">Seneca</name> of his 
reconciliation with <name type="person">Thrasea</name>, on which <name type="person">Seneca</name> congratulated him. And now 
henceforth the glory and the peril of these illustrious men grew 
greater.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>Meanwhile, in the beginning 
of spring, Parthian envoys brought a message from king <name type="person">Vologeses</name>, with a 
letter to the same effect. "He did not," it was said, "repeat his former and 
frequent claims to the holding of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, since the 
gods who ruled the destinies of the most powerful nations, had handed over 
its possession to the <name type="ethnic">Parthians</name>, not without disgrace to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Only lately, he had besieged <name type="person">Tigranes</name>; afterwards, 
he let <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> and his legions depart in safety when he could have 
destroyed them. He had tried force with a satisfactory result; he had also 
given clemency a trial. Nor would <name type="person">Tiridates</name> refuse a journey to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> to receive the crown, were he not detained at home 
by the duties of a sacred office. He was ready to go to the emperor's image 
in the Roman headquarters, and there in the presence of the legions 
inaugurate his reign."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>As 
<name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>'s despatch contradicted this letter from <name type="person">Vologeses</name> and implied 
that matters were unchanged, the centurion who had arrived with the envoys 
was questioned as to the state of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>. He 
replied that all the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had quitted it. Then was perceived the mockery 
of the barbarians in petitioning for what they had wrested from us, and <name type="person">Nero</name> 
consulted with the chief men of the State whether they should accept a 
dangerous war or a disgraceful peace. There was no hesitation about war. 
<name type="person">Corbulo</name>, who had known our soldiers and the enemy for so many years, was 
appointed to conduct it, that there might be no more blunders through any 
other officer's incapacity; for people were utterly disgusted with 
<name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>. </p>
<p>So the envoys were sent back without an answer, but 
with

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NEW PARTHIAN WAR; CORBULO COMMANDS</note>
some 
presents, in order to inspire a hope that <name type="person">Tiridates</name> would not make the same 
request in vain, if only he presented his petition in person. The 
administration of <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> was intrusted to <name type="person">Caius 
Itius</name>, and the military forces to <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, to which was added the fifteenth 
legion, under the leadership of <name type="person">Marius Celsus</name>, from <rs type="placename">Pannonia</rs>. Written orders were sent to the tetrarchs, the 
tributaries, kings, prefects and procurators, and all the pr&aelig;tors who 
governed the neighbouring provinces, to obey <name type="person">Corbulo</name>'s commands, as his 
powers were enlarged on much the same scale as that which the Roman people 
had granted to <name type="person">Cneius Pompeius</name> on the eve of his war against the Pirates. 
When <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> returned and dreaded something worse, the emperor thought 
it enough to reproach him with a jest, to the effect that he pardoned him at 
once, lest one so ready to take fright might sink under prolonged 
suspense.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p><name type="person">Corbulo</name> meantime 
transferred to <rs type="placename">Syria</rs> the fourth and twelfth legions, 
which, from the loss of their bravest men and the panic of the remainder, 
seemed quite unfit for battle, and led thence into <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs> the third and sixth legions, troops in thorough 
efficiency, and trained by frequent and successful service. And he added to 
his army the fifth legion, which, having been quartered in <rs type="placename">Pontus</rs>, had known nothing of disaster, with men of the 
fifteenth, lately brought up, and picked veterans from <rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs> and <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs>, and all the 
allied cavalry and infantry, and the auxiliaries of the tributary princes, 
which had been concentrated at <rs type="placename">Melitene</rs>, where he 
was preparing to cross the <rs type="placename">Euphrates</rs>. Then, after 
the due lustration of his army, he called them together for an harangue, and 
began with grand allusions to the imperial auspices, and to his own 
achievements, while he attributed their disasters to the incapacity of 
<name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>. He spoke with much impressiveness, which in him, as a military 
man, was as good as eloquence.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>He 
then pursued the route opened up in former days by <name type="person">Lucius Lucullus</name>, clearing 
away the obstructions of long years. Envoys who came to him from <name type="person">Tiridates</name> 
and <name type="person">Vologeses</name> about peace, he did not repulse, but sent back with them some 
centurions with a message anything but harsh. "Matters," he said, "have not 
yet gone so far as to require

the extremity of war. Many 
successes have fallen to the lot of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, some to 
that of <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs>, as a warning against pride. 
Therefore, it is to the advantage of <name type="person">Tiridates</name> to accept as a gift a kingdom 
yet unhurt by the ravages of war, and <name type="person">Vologeses</name> will better consult the 
welfare of the Parthian people by an alliance with <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> than by mutual injuries. I know how much there is 
of internal discord, and over what untamably fierce tribes he reigns. My 
emperor, on the other hand, has undisturbed peace all around him, and this 
is his only war." </p>
<p>In an instant <name type="person">Corbulo</name> backed up his advice by a 
menacing attitude. He drove from their possessions the nobles of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, who had been the first to revolt from us, 
destroyed their fortresses, and spread equal panic throughout the plain and 
the hill country, among the strong and among the weak.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>Against the name of <name type="person">Corbulo</name> no rage, nothing of the 
hatred of an enemy, was felt by the barbarians, and they therefore thought 
his advice trustworthy. Consequently <name type="person">Vologeses</name> was not implacable to the 
uttermost, and he even asked a truce for some divisions of his kingdom. 
<name type="person">Tiridates</name> demanded a place and a day for an interview. The time was to be 
soon, the place, that in which <name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> and his legions had been lately 
besieged, for this was chosen by the barbarians in remembrance for their 
more prosperous fortune. <name type="person">Corbulo</name> did not refuse, resolved that a widely 
different issue should enhance his renown. Nor did the disgrace of 
<name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name> trouble him, as was clearly proved by the fact that he commanded 
<name type="person">P&aelig;tus</name>' son, who was a tribune, to take some companies with him and 
cover up the relics of that ill-starred battle-field. On the day appointed, 
<name type="person">Tiberius Alexander</name>, a distinguished Roman knight, sent to assist in the 
campaign, and <name type="person">Vinianus Annius</name>, <name type="person">Corbulo</name>'s son-in-law, who, though not yet of 
a senator's age, had the command of the fifth legion as "legatus," entered 
the camp of <name type="person">Tiridates</name>, by way of compliment to him, and to reassure him 
against treachery by so valuable a pledge. Each then took with him twenty 
horsemen. The king, seeing <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, was the first to dismount, and <name type="person">Corbulo</name> 
hesitated not a moment, but both on foot joined their right hands.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>Then the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> commended the young prince 
for

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CORBULO'S DIPLOMATIC SUCCESS</note>
abandoning rash 
courses, and adopting a safe and expedient policy. <name type="person">Tiridates</name> first dwelt 
much on the nobility of his race, but went on to speak in a tone of 
moderation. He would go to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and bring the 
emperor a new glory, a suppliant Arsacid, while <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> was prosperous. It was then agreed that 
<name type="person">Tiridates</name> should lay down his royal crown before <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>'s image, and 
resume it only from the hand of <name type="person">Nero</name>. The interview then ended with a kiss. 
After an interval of a few days there was a grand display on both sides; on 
the one, cavalry ranged in squadrons with their national ensigns; on the 
other, stood the columns of our legions with glittering eagles and standards 
and images of deities, after the appearance of a temple. In the midst, on a 
tribunal, was a chair of state, and on the chair a statue of <name type="person">Nero</name>. To this 
<name type="person">Tiridates</name> advanced, and having slain the customary victims, he removed the 
crown from his head, and set it at the foot of the statue; whereupon all 
felt a deep thrill of emotion, rendered the more intense by the sight which 
yet lingered before their eyes, of the slaughter or siege of Roman armies. 
"But now," they thought, "the calamity is reversed; <name type="person">Tiridates</name> is about to 
go, a spectacle to the world, little better than a prisoner."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>To military glory <name type="person">Corbulo</name> added courtesy and 
hospitality. When the king continually asked the reason of whatever he 
noticed which was new to him, the announcements, for example, by a centurion 
of the beginnings of each watch, the dismissal of the guests by the sound of 
a trumpet, and the lighting by a torch from beneath of an altar in front of 
the headquarters, <name type="person">Corbulo</name>, by exaggerating everything, filled him with 
admiration of our ancient system. Next day <name type="person">Tiridates</name> begged for time which, 
as he was about to enter on so long a journey, might suffice for a previous 
visit to his brothers and his mother. Meanwhile he gave up his daughter as a 
hostage, and prepared a suppliant letter to <name type="person">Nero</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>He then departed, and found <name type="person">Pacorus</name> in <rs type="placename">Media</rs>, and <name type="person">Vologeses</name> at <rs type="placename">Ecbatana</rs>, who was by no means unconcerned for his 
brother. In fact, <name type="person">Vologeses</name> had entreated <name type="person">Corbulo</name> by special messengers, 
that <name type="person">Tiridates</name> might not have to endure any badge of slavery, or have to 
deliver up his sword, or be debarred the honour of embracing the governors 
of the prov-

inces, or have to present himself at their doors, 
and that he might be treated at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> with as much 
respect as the consuls. Accustomed, forsooth, to foreign arrogance, he had 
no knowledge of us, who value the reality of empire and disregard its empty 
show.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>That same year the emperor put 
into possession of the Latin franchise the tribes of the maritime <rs type="placename">Alps</rs>. To the Roman knights he assigned places in the 
circus in front of the seats of the people, for up to that time they used to 
enter in a promiscuous throng, as the Roscian law extended only to fourteen 
rows in the theatre. The same year witnessed shows of gladiators as 
magnificent as those of the past. Many ladies of distinction, however, and 
senators, disgraced themselves by appearing in the amphitheatre.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>In the year of the consulship of <name type="person">Caius 
L&aelig;canius</name> and <name type="person">Marcus Licinius</name> a yet keener impulse urged <name type="person">Nero</name> to show 
himself frequently on the public stage. Hitherto he had sung in private 
houses or gardens, during the Juvenile games, but these he now despised, as 
being but little frequented, and on too small a scale for so fine a voice. 
As, however, he did not venture to make a beginning at <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, he chose <rs type="placename">Neapolis</rs>, because 
it was a Greek city. From this as his starting-point he might cross into <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs>, and there, winning the well-known and sacred 
garlands of antiquity, evoke, with increased fame, the enthusiasm of the 
citizens. Accordingly, a rabble of the townsfolk was brought together, with 
those whom the excitement of such an event had attracted from the 
neighbouring towns and colonies, and such as followed in the emperor's train 
to pay him honour or for various objects. All these, with some companies of 
soldiers, filled the theatre at <rs type="placename">Neapolis</rs>.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>There an incident occurred, which many 
thought unlucky, though to the emperor it seemed due to the providence of 
auspicious deities. The people who had been present, had quitted the 
theatre, and the empty building then fell in without harm to anyone. 
Thereupon <name type="person">Nero</name> in an elaborate ode thanked the gods, celebrating the good 
luck which attended the late downfall, and as he was on his way to cross the 
sea of <rs type="placename">Hadria</rs>, he rested awhile at <rs type="placename">Beneventum</rs>, where a crowded gladiatorial show was being 
exhibited by <name type="person">Vatinius</name>.

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FRANCHISE EXTENDED; NERO ON 
STAGE</note>
The man was one of the most conspicuously infamous sights in 
the imperial court, bred, as he had been, in a shoemaker's shop, of a 
deformed person and vulgar wit, originally introduced as a butt. After a 
time he grew so powerful by accusing all the best men, that in influence, 
wealth, and ability to injure, he was pre-eminent even in that bad 
company.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>While <name type="person">Nero</name> was frequently 
visiting the show, even amid his pleasures there was no cessation to his 
crimes. For during the very same period <name type="person">Torquatus Silanus</name> was forced to die, 
because over and above his illustrious rank as one of the Junian family he 
claimed to be the great-grandson of <name type="person">Augustus</name>. Accusers were ordered to 
charge him with prodigality in lavishing gifts, and with having no hope but 
in revolution. They said further that he had nobles about him for his 
letters, books, and accounts, titles all and rehearsals of supreme power. 
Then the most intimate of his freedmen were put in chains and torn from him, 
till, knowing the doom which impended, <name type="person">Torquatus</name> divided the arteries in his 
arms. A speech from <name type="person">Nero</name> followed, as usual, which stated that though he was 
guilty and with good reason distrusted his defence, he would yet have lived, 
had he awaited the clemency of the judge.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>Soon afterwards, giving up <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs> for 
the present (his reasons were not certainly known), he returned to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, there dwelling in his secret imaginations on the 
provinces of the east, especially <rs type="placename">Egypt</rs>. Then having 
declared in a public proclamation that his absence would not be long and 
that all things in the State would remain unchanged and prosperous, he 
visited the temple of the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs> for advice about his departure. There he 
adored the gods; then he entered also the <rs type="placename">temple of Vesta</rs>, and there feeling 
a sudden trembling throughout his limbs, either from terror inspired by the 
deity or because, from the remembrance of his crimes, he was never free from 
fear, he relinquished his purpose, repeatedly saying that all his plans were 
of less account than his love of his country. "He had seen the sad 
countenances of the citizens, he heard their secret complainings at the 
prospect of his entering on so long a journey, when they could not bear so 
much as his brief excursions, accustomed as they were to cheer themselves 
under mischances by the

sight of the emperor. Hence, as in 
private relationships the closest ties were the strongest, so the people of 
<rs type="placename">Rome</rs> had the most powerful claims and must be obeyed 
in their wish to retain him." </p>
<p>These and the like sentiments suited the 
people, who craved amusement, and feared, always their chief anxiety, 
scarcity of corn, should he be absent. The Senate and leading citizens were 
in doubt whether to regard him as more terrible at a distance or among them. 
After a while, as is the way with great terrors, they thought what happened 
the worst alternative.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p><name type="person">Nero</name>, to win 
credit for himself of enjoying nothing so much as the capital, prepared 
banquets in the public places, and used the whole city, so to say, as his 
private house. Of these entertainments the most famous for their notorious 
profligacy were those furnished by <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, which I will describe as an 
illustration, that I may not have again and again to narrate similar 
extravagance. He had a raft constructed on <name type="person">Agrippa</name>'s lake, put the guests on 
board and set it in motion by other vessels towing it. These vessels 
glittered with gold and ivory; the crews were arranged according to age and 
experience in vice. Birds and beasts had been procured from remote 
countries, and sea monsters from the ocean. On the margin of the lake were 
set up brothels crowded with noble ladies, and on the opposite bank were 
seen naked prostitutes with obscene gestures and movements. As darkness 
approached, all the adjacent grove and surrounding buildings resounded with 
song, and shone brilliantly with lights. <name type="person">Nero</name>, who polluted himself by every 
lawful or lawless indulgence, had not omitted a single abomination which 
could heighten his depravity, till a few days afterwards he stooped to marry 
himself to one of that filthy herd, by name <name type="person">Pythagoras</name>, with all the forms 
of regular wedlock. The bridal veil was put over the emperor; people saw the 
witnesses of the ceremony, the wedding dower, the couch and the nuptial 
torches; everything in a word was plainly visible, which, even when a woman 
weds darkness hides.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>A disaster 
followed, whether accidental or treacherously contrived by the emperor, is 
uncertain, as authors have

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GREAT FIRE AT <rs type="placename">ROME</rs></note>
given both accounts, worse, however, and 
more dreadful than any which have ever happened to this city by the violence 
of fire. It had its beginning in that part of the circus which adjoins the 
<rs type="placename">Palatine</rs> and <rs type="placename">C&aelig;lian</rs> 
hills, where, amid the shops containing inflammable wares, the conflagration 
both broke out and instantly became so fierce and so rapid from the wind 
that it seized in its grasp the entire length of the circus. For here there 
were no houses fenced in by solid masonry, or temples surrounded by walls, 
or any other obstacle to interpose delay. The blaze in its fury ran first 
through the level portions of the city, then rising to the hills, while it 
again devastated every place below them, it outstripped all preventive 
measures; so rapid was the mischief and so completely at its mercy the city, 
with those narrow winding passages and irregular streets, which 
characterised old <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Added to this were the 
wailings of terror-stricken women, the feebleness of age, the helpless 
inexperience of childhood, the crowds who sought to save themselves or 
others, dragging out the infirm or waiting for them, and by their hurry in 
the one case, by their delay in the other, aggravating the confusion. Often, 
while they looked behind them, they were intercepted by flames on their side 
or in their face. Or if they reached a refuge close at hand, when this too 
was seized by the fire, they found that, even places, which they had 
imagined to be remote, were involved in the same calamity. At last, doubting 
what they should avoid or whither betake themselves, they crowded the 
streets or flung themselves down in the fields, while some who had lost 
their all, even their very daily bread, and others out of love for their 
kinsfolk, whom they had been unable to rescue, perished, though escape was 
open to them. And no one dared to stop the mischief, because of incessant 
menaces from a number of persons who forbade the extinguishing of the 
flames, because again others openly hurled brands, and kept shouting that 
there was one who gave them authority, either seeking to plunder more 
freely, or obeying orders.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> at 
this time was at <rs type="placename">Antium</rs>, and did not return to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> until the fire approached his house, which he had 
built to connect the palace with the <rs type="placename">gardens of M&aelig;cenas</rs>. It could not, 
however, be stopped from devouring the palace,

the house, and 
everything around it. However, to relieve the people, driven out homeless as 
they were, he threw open to them the <rs type="placename">Campus Martius</rs> 
and the public buildings of <name type="person">Agrippa</name>, and even his own gardens, and raised 
temporary structures to receive the destitute multitude. Supplies of food 
were brought up from <rs type="placename">Ostia</rs> and the neighbouring 
towns, and the price of corn was reduced to three sesterces a peck. These 
acts, though popular, produced no effect, since a rumour had gone forth 
everywhere that, at the very time when the city was in flames, the emperor 
appeared on a private stage and sang of the destruction of <rs type="placename">Troy</rs>, comparing present misfortunes with the calamities 
of antiquity.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>At last, after five 
days, an end was put to the conflagration at the foot of the <rs type="placename">Esquiline</rs> hill, by the destruction of all buildings on a 
vast space, so that the violence of the fire was met by clear ground and an 
open sky. But before people had laid aside their fears, the flames returned, 
with no less fury this second time, and especially in the spacious districts 
of the city. Consequently, though there was less loss of life, the temples 
of the gods, and the porticoes which were devoted to enjoyment, fell in a 
yet more widespread ruin. And to this conflagration there attached the 
greater infamy because it broke out on the &AElig;milian property of 
<name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, and it seemed that <name type="person">Nero</name> was aiming at the glory of founding a 
new city and calling it by his name. <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, indeed, 
is divided into fourteen districts, four of which remained uninjured, three 
were levelled to the ground, while in the other seven were left only a few 
shattered, half-burnt relics of houses.</p></div2>

tutelary deities of the Roman people, were burnt. So too were the riches 
acquired by our many victories, various beauties of Greek art, then again 
the ancient and genuine historical monuments of men of genius,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO BUILDS PALACE IN RUINS</note>
and, notwithstanding the 
striking splendour of the restored city, old men will remember many things 
which could not be replaced. Some persons observed that the beginning of 
this conflagration was on the 19th of July, the day on which the Senones 
captured and fired <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Others have pushed a 
curious inquiry so far as to reduce the interval between these two 
conflagrations into equal numbers of years, months, and days.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> meanwhile availed himself of his country's 
desolation, and erected a mansion in which the jewels and gold, long 
familiar objects, quite vulgarised by our extravagance, were not so 
marvellous as the fields and lakes, with woods on one side to resemble a 
wilderness, and, on the other, open spaces and extensive views. The 
directors and contrivers of the work were <name type="person">Severus</name> and <name type="person">Celer</name>, who had the 
genius and the audacity to attempt by art even what nature had refused, and 
to fool away an emperor's resources. They had actually undertaken to sink a 
navigable canal from the lake <rs type="placename">Avernus</rs> to the mouths 
of the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs> along a barren shore or through the 
face of hills, where one meets with no moisture which could supply water, 
except the <rs type="placename">Pomptine marshes</rs>. The rest of the country is broken rock and 
perfectly dry. Even if it could be cut through, the labour would be 
intolerable, and there would be no adequate result. <name type="person">Nero</name>, however, with his 
love of the impossible, endeavoured to dig through the nearest hills to <rs type="placename">Avernus</rs>, and there still remain the traces of his 
disappointed hope.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>Of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> meanwhile, so much as was left unoccupied by his 
mansion, was not built up, as it had been after its burning by the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, 
without any regularity or in any fashion, but with rows of streets according 
to measurement, with broad thoroughfares, with a restriction on the height 
of houses, with open spaces, and the further addition of colonnades, as a 
protection to the frontage of the blocks of tenements. These colonnades <name type="person">Nero</name> 
promised to erect at his own expense, and to hand over the open spaces, when 
cleared of the d&eacute;bris, to the ground landlords. He also offered 
rewards proportioned to each person's position and property, and prescribed 
a period within which they were to obtain them on the completion of so many 
houses or blocks of building

He fixed on the marshes of <rs type="placename">Ostia</rs> for the reception of the rubbish, and arranged 
that the ships which had brought up corn by the <rs type="placename">Tiber</rs>, should sail down the river with cargoes of this 
rubbish. The buildings themselves, to a certain height, were to be solidly 
constructed, without wooden beams, of stone from <rs type="placename">Gabii</rs> or <rs type="placename">Alba</rs>, that material 
being impervious to fire. And to provide that the water which individual 
license had illegally appropriated, might flow in greater abundance in 
several places for the public use, officers were appointed, and everyone was 
to have in the open court the means of stopping a fire. Every building, too, 
was to be enclosed by its own proper wall, not by one common to others. 
These changes which were liked for their utility, also added beauty to the 
new city. Some, however, thought that its old arrangement had been more 
conducive to health, inasmuch as the narrow streets with the elevation of 
the roofs were not equally penetrated by the sun's heat, while now the open 
space, unsheltered by any shade, was scorched by a fiercer glow.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>Such indeed were the precautions of human 
wisdom. The next thing was to seek means of propitiating the gods, and 
recourse was had to the Sibylline books, by the direction of which prayers 
were offered to <name type="person">Vulcanus</name>, <name type="person">Ceres</name>, and <name type="person">Proserpina</name>. <name type="person">Juno</name>, too, was entreated by 
the matrons, first, in the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs>, then on the nearest part of the coast, 
whence water was procured to sprinkle the fane and image of the goddess. And 
there were sacred banquets and nightly vigils celebrated by married women. 
But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the 
propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the 
conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the 
report, <name type="person">Nero</name> fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on 
a class hated for their abominations, called <placeName key="tgn,2238725">Christians</placeName> by the populace. 
<name type="person">Christus</name>, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty 
during the reign of <name type="person">Tiberius</name> at the hands of one of our procurators, <name type="person">Pontius 
Pilatus</name>, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, 
again broke out not only in <rs type="placename">Jud&aelig;a</rs>, the first source of the evil, but 
even in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, where all things hideous and shameful 
from every part of the world find their

centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was 
first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an 
immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the 
city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their 
deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and 
perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, 
to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired. </p>
<p><name type="person"><placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName></name> 
offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the 
circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or 
stood aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and 
exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, 
as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man's cruelty, that they 
were being destroyed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>Meanwhile <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> was thoroughly exhausted by contributions of 
money, the provinces were ruined, as also the allied nations and the free 
states, as they were called. Even the gods fell victims to the plunder; for 
the temples in <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> were despoiled and the gold 
carried off, which, for a triumph or a vow, the Roman people in every age 
had consecrated in their prosperity or their alarm. Throughout <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> and <rs type="placename">Achaia</rs> not only votive 
gifts, but the images of deities were seized, <name type="person">Acratus</name> and <name type="person">Secundus Carinas</name> 
having been sent into those provinces. The first was a freedman ready for 
any wickedness; the latter, as far as speech went, was thoroughly trained in 
Greek learning, but he had not imbued his heart with sound principles. 
<name type="person">Seneca</name>, it was said, to avert from himself the obloquy of sacrilege, begged 
for the seclusion of a remote rural retreat, and, when it was refused, 
feigning ill health, as though he had a nervous ailment, would not quit his 
chamber. According to some writers, poison was prepared for him at <name type="person">Nero</name>'s 
command by his own freedman, whose name was <name type="person">Cleonicus</name>. This <name type="person">Seneca</name> avoided 
through the freedman's disclosure, or his own apprehension, while he used to 
support life on the very simple diet of wild fruits, with water from a 
running stream when thirst prompted.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>During the same time some gladiators in the town of <rs type="placename">Pr&aelig;neste</rs>, who 
attempted to break loose, were put down by

a military guard 
stationed on the spot to watch them, and the people, ever desirous and yet 
fearful of change, began at once to talk of <name type="person">Spartacus</name>, and of bygone 
calamities. Soon afterwards, tidings of a naval disaster was received, but 
not from war, for never had there been so profound a peace. <name type="person">Nero</name>, however, 
had ordered the fleet to return to <rs type="placename">Campania</rs> on a 
fixed day, without making any allowance for the dangers of the sea. 
Consequently the pilots, in spite of the fury of the waves, started from <rs type="placename">Formi&aelig;</rs>, and while they were struggling to double 
the promontory of <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs>, they were dashed by a 
violent south-west wind on the shores of <rs type="placename">Cum&aelig;</rs>, 
and lost, in all directions, a number of their triremes with some smaller 
vessels.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>At the close of the year 
people talked much about prodigies, presaging impending evils. Never were 
lightning flashes more frequent, and a comet too appeared, for which <name type="person">Nero</name> 
always made propitiation with noble blood. Human and other births with two 
heads were exposed to public view, or were discovered in those sacrifices in 
which it is usual to immolate victims in a pregnant condition. And in the 
district of <rs type="placename">Placentia</rs>, close to the road, a calf was 
born with its head attached to its leg. Then followed an explanation of the 
diviners, that another head was preparing for the world, which however would 
be neither mighty nor hidden, as its growth had been checked in the womb, 
and it had been born by the wayside.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p><name type="person">Silius Nerva</name> and <name type="person">Atticus Vestinus</name> then entered on the consulship, and now a 
conspiracy was planned, and at once became formidable, for which senators, 
knights, soldiers, even women, had given their names with eager rivalry, out 
of hatred of <name type="person">Nero</name> as well as a liking for <name type="person">Caius Piso</name>. A descendant of the 
Calpurnian house, and embracing in his connections through his father's 
noble rank many illustrious families, <name type="person">Piso</name> had a splendid reputation with 
the people from his virtue or semblance of virtue. His eloquence he 
exercised in the defence of fellow-citizens, his generosity towards friends, 
while even for strangers he had a courteous address and demeanour. He had, 
too, the fortuitous advantages of tall stature and a handsome face. But 
solidity of character and moderation in pleasure were wholly alien to him. 
He

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">PISO'S CONSPIRACY AGAINST NERO</note>
indulged in 
laxity, in display, and occasionally in excess. This suited the taste of 
that numerous class who, when the attractions of vice are so powerful, do 
not wish for strictness or special severity on the throne.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>The origin of the conspiracy was not in <name type="person">Piso</name>'s 
personal ambition. But I could not easily narrate who first planned it, or 
whose prompting inspired a scheme into which so many entered. That the 
leading spirits were <name type="person">Subrius Flavus</name>, tribune of a pr&aelig;torian cohort, 
and <name type="person">Sulpicius Asper</name>, a centurion, was proved by the fearlessness of their 
death. <name type="person">Lucanus Ann&aelig;us</name>, too, and <name type="person">Plautius Lateranus</name>, imported into it 
an intensely keen resentment. <name type="person">Lucanus</name> had the stimulus of personal motives, 
for <name type="person">Nero</name> tried to disparage the fame of his poems and, with the foolish 
vanity of a rival, had forbidden him to publish them. As for <name type="person">Lateranus</name>, a 
consul-elect, it was no wrong, but love of the State which linked him with 
the others. <name type="person">Flavius Sc&aelig;vinus</name> and <name type="person">Afranius Quintianus</name>, on the other 
hand, both of senatorian rank, contrary to what was expected of them, 
undertook the beginning of this daring crime. <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name>, indeed, had 
enfeebled his mind by excess, and his life, accordingly, was one of sleepy 
languor. <name type="person">Quintianus</name>, infamous for his effeminate vice, had been satirised by 
<name type="person">Nero</name> in a lampoon, and was bent on avenging the insult.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>So, while they dropped hints among themselves or 
among their friends about the emperor's crimes, the approaching end of 
empire, and the importance of choosing some one to rescue the State in its 
distress, they associated with them <name type="person">Tullius Senecio</name>, <name type="person">Cervarius Proculus</name>, 
<name type="person">Vulcatius Araricus</name>, <name type="person">Julius Augurinus</name>, <name type="person">Munatius Gratus</name>, <name type="person">Antonius Natalis</name>, and 
<name type="person">Marcius Festus</name>, all Roman knights. Of these <name type="person">Senecio</name>, one of those who was 
specially intimate with <name type="person">Nero</name>, still kept up a show of friendship, and had 
consequently to struggle with all the more dangers. <name type="person">Natalis</name> shared with <name type="person">Piso</name> 
all his secret plans. The rest built their hopes on revolution. Besides 
<name type="person">Subrius</name> and <name type="person">Sulpicius</name>, whom I have already mentioned, they invited the aid 
of military strength, of <name type="person">Gavius Silvanus</name> and <name type="person">Statius Proximus</name>, tribunes of 
pr&aelig;torian cohorts, and of two centurions, <name type="person">Maximus Scaurus</name> and <name type="person">Venetus 
Paulus</name>. But their mainstay, it was thought, was <name type="person">F&aelig;nius Rufus</name>, the 
commander of the guard, a man of esteemed life

and character, to 
whom <name type="person">Tigellinus</name> with his brutality and shamelessness was superior in the 
emperor's regard. He harassed him with calumnies, and had often put him in 
terror by hinting that he had been <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s paramour, and from sorrow at 
her loss was intent on vengeance. And so, when the conspirators were assured 
by his own repeated language that the commander of the pr&aelig;torian guard 
had come over to their side, they once more eagerly discussed the time and 
place of the fatal deed. It was said that <name type="person">Subrius Flavus</name> had formed a sudden 
resolution to attack <name type="person">Nero</name> when singing on the stage, or when his house was 
in flames and he was running hither and thither, unattended, in the 
darkness. In the one case was the opportunity of solitude; in the other, the 
very crowd which would witness so glorious a deed, had roused a singularly 
noble soul; it was only the desire of escape, that foe to all great 
enterprises, which held him back.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>Meanwhile, as they hesitated in prolonged suspense between hope and fear, a 
certain <name type="person">Epicharis</name> (how she informed herself is uncertain, as she had never 
before had a thought of anything noble) began to stir and upbraid the 
conspirators. Wearied at last of their long delay, she endeavoured, when 
staying in <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>, to shake the loyalty of the 
officers of the fleet at <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs>, and to entangle 
them in a guilty complicity. She began thus. There was a captain in the 
fleet, <name type="person">Volusius Proculus</name>, who had been one of <name type="person">Nero</name>'s instruments in his 
mother's murder, and had not, as he thought, been promoted in proportion to 
the greatness of his crime. Either, as an old acquaintance of the woman, or 
on the strength of a recent intimacy, he divulged to her his services to 
<name type="person">Nero</name> and their barren result to himself, adding complaints, and his 
determination to have vengeance, should the chance arise. He thus inspired 
the hope that he could be persuaded, and could secure many others. No small 
help was to be found in the fleet, and there would be numerous 
opportunities, as <name type="person">Nero</name> delighted in frequent enjoyment of the sea off <rs type="placename">Puteoli</rs> and <rs type="placename">Misenum</rs>. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">Epicharis</name> accordingly said more, and began the history of all the 
emperor's crimes. "The Senate," she affirmed, "had no power left it; yet 
means had been provided whereby he might pay the penalty of having destroyed 
the State. Only 

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">EXTENT OF CONSPIRACY</note>
let <name type="person">Proculus</name> 
gird himself to do his part and bring over to their side his bravest 
soldiers, and then look for an adequate recompense." The conspirators' 
names, however, she withheld. Consequently the information of <name type="person">Proculus</name> was 
useless, even though he reported what he had heard to <name type="person">Nero</name>. For <name type="person">Epicharis</name> 
being summoned and confronted with the informer easily silenced him, 
unsupported as he was by a single witness. But she was herself detained in 
custody, for <name type="person">Nero</name> suspected that even what was not proved to be true, was 
not wholly false.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>The conspirators, 
however, alarmed by the fear of disclosure, resolved to hurry on the 
assassination at <rs type="placename">Bai&aelig;</rs>, in <name type="person">Piso</name>'s villa, 
whither the emperor, charmed by its loveliness, often went, and where, 
unguarded and without the cumbrous grandeur of his rank, he would enjoy the 
bath and the banquet. But <name type="person">Piso</name> refused, alleging the odium of an act which 
would stain with an emperor's blood, however bad he might be, the sanctity 
of the hospitable board and the deities who preside over it. "Better," he 
said, "in the capital, in that hateful mansion which was piled up with the 
plunder of the citizens, or in public, to accomplish what on the State's 
behalf they had undertaken." </p>
<p>So he said openly, with however a secret 
apprehension that <name type="person">Lucius Silanus</name> might, on the strength of his distinguished 
rank and the teachings of <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name>, under whom he had been trained, 
aspire to any greatness and seize on empire, which would be promptly offered 
him by all who had no part in the conspiracy, and who would pity <name type="person">Nero</name> as the 
victim of a crime. Many thought that <name type="person">Piso</name> shunned also the enterprising 
spirit of <name type="person">Vestinus</name>, the consul, who might, he feared, rise up in the cause 
of freedom, or, by choosing another emperor, make the State his own gift. 
<name type="person">Vestinus</name>, indeed, had no share in the conspiracy, though <name type="person">Nero</name> on that charge 
gratified an old resentment against an innocent man.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>At last they decided to carry out their design on 
that day of the circus games, which is celebrated in honour of <name type="person">Ceres</name>, as the 
emperor, who seldom went out, and shut himself up in his house or gardens, 
used to go to the entertainments of the circus, and access to him was the 
easier from his keen enjoyment of the spectacle. They had so arranged

the order of the plot, that <name type="person">Lateranus</name> was to throw himself at the 
prince's knees in earnest entreaty, apparently craving relief for his 
private necessities, and, being a man of strong nerve and huge frame, hurl 
him to the ground and hold him down. When he was prostrate and powerless, 
the tribunes and centurions and all the others who had sufficient daring 
were to rush up and do the murder, the first blow being claimed by 
<name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name>, who had taken a dagger from the <rs type="placename">Temple of Safety</rs>, or, 
according to another account, from that of Fortune, in the town of <rs type="placename">Ferentum</rs>, and used to wear the weapon as though 
dedicated to some noble deed. <name type="person">Piso</name>, meanwhile, was to wait in the sanctuary 
of <name type="person">Ceres</name>, whence he was to be summoned by <name type="person">F&aelig;nius</name>, the commander of the 
guard, and by the others, and then conveyed into the camp, accompanied by 
<name type="person">Antonia</name>, the daughter of <name type="person">Claudius C&aelig;sar</name>, with a view to evoke the 
people's enthusiasm. So it is related by <name type="person">Caius Pliny</name>. Handed down from 
whatever source, I had no intention of suppressing it, however absurd it may 
seem, either that <name type="person">Antonia</name> should have lent her name at her life's peril to a 
hopeless project, or that <name type="person">Piso</name>, with his well-known affection for his wife, 
should have pledged himself to another marriage, but for the fact that the 
lust of dominion inflames the heart more than any other passion.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>It was however wonderful how among people of 
different class, rank, age, sex, among rich and poor, everything was kept in 
secrecy till betrayal began from the house of <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name>. The day before 
the treacherous attempt, after a long conversation with <name type="person">Antonius Natalis</name>, 
<name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name> returned home, sealed his will, and, drawing from its sheath 
the dagger of which I have already spoken, and complaining that it was 
blunted from long disuse, he ordered it to be sharpened on a stone to a keen 
and bright point. This task he assigned to his freedman <name type="person">Milichus</name>. At the 
same time he sat down to a more than usually sumptuous banquet, and gave his 
favourite slaves their freedom, and money to others. He was himself 
depressed, and evidently in profound thought, though he affected gaiety in 
desultory conversation. Last of all, he directed ligatures for wounds and 
the means of stanching blood to be prepared by the same <name type="person">Milichus</name>, who either 
knew of the conspiracy and was faithful up to this

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">CONSPIRACY BETRAYED</note>
point, or was in complete ignorance 
and then first caught suspicions, as most authors have inferred from what 
followed. For when his servile imagination dwelt on the rewards of perfidy, 
and he saw before him at the same moment boundless wealth and power, 
conscience and care for his patron's life, together with the remembrance of 
the freedom he had received, fled from him. From his wife, too, he had 
adopted a womanly and yet baser suggestion; for she even held over him a 
dreadful thought, that many had been present, both freedmen and slaves, who 
had seen what he had; that one man's silence would be useless, whereas the 
rewards would be for him alone who was first with the 
information.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>Accordingly at daybreak 
<name type="person">Milichus</name> went to the <rs type="placename">Servilian gardens</rs>, and, finding the doors shut against 
him, said again and again that he was the bearer of important and alarming 
news. Upon this he was conducted by the gate-keepers to one of <name type="person">Nero</name>'s 
freedmen, <name type="person">Epaphroditus</name>, and by him to <name type="person">Nero</name>, whom he informed of the urgent 
danger, of the formidable conspiracy, and of all else which he had heard or 
inferred. He showed him too the weapon prepared for his destruction, and 
bade him summon the accused. </p>
<p><name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name> on being arrested by the 
soldiers began his defence with the reply that the dagger about which he was 
accused, had of old been regarded with a religious sentiment by his 
ancestors, that it had been kept in his chamber, and been stolen by a trick 
of his freedman. He had often, he said, signed his will without heeding the 
observance of particular days, and had previously given presents of money as 
well as freedom to some of his slaves, only on this occasion he gave more 
freely, because, as his means were now impoverished and his creditors were 
pressing him, he distrusted the validity of his will. Certainly his table 
had always been profusely furnished, and his life luxurious, such as rigid 
censors would hardly approve. As to the bandages for wounds, none had been 
prepared at his order, but as all the man's other charges were absurd, he 
added an accusation in which he might make himself alike informer and 
witness. </p>
<p>He backed up his words by an air of resolution. Turning on his 
accuser, he denounced him as an infamous and depraved wretch, with so 
fearless a voice and look that the in-

formation was beginning to 
collapse, when <name type="person">Milichus</name> was reminded by his wife that <name type="person">Antonious Natalis</name> had 
had a long secret conversation with <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name>, and that both were 
<name type="person">Piso</name>'s intimate friends.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p><name type="person">Natalis</name> was 
therefore summoned, and they were separately asked what the conversation 
was, and what was its subject. Then a suspicion arose because their answers 
did not agree, and they were both put in irons. They could not endure the 
sight and the threat of torture. <name type="person">Natalis</name> however, taking the initiative, 
knowing as he did more of the whole conspiracy, and being also more 
practised in accusing, first confessed about <name type="person">Piso</name>, next added the name of 
<name type="person">Ann&aelig;us Seneca</name>, either as having been a messenger between him and <name type="person">Piso</name>, 
or to win the favour of <name type="person">Nero</name>, who hated <name type="person">Seneca</name> and sought every means for 
his ruin. Then <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name> too, when he knew the disclosure of <name type="person">Natalis</name>, 
with like pusillanimity, or under the impression that everything was now 
divulged, and that there could be no advantage in silence, revealed the 
other conspirators. Of these, <name type="person">Lucanus</name>, <name type="person">Quintianus</name>, and <name type="person">Senecio</name> long 
persisted in denial; after a time, when bribed by the promise of impunity, 
anxious to excuse their reluctance, <name type="person">Lucanus</name> named his mother <name type="person">Atilla</name>, 
<name type="person">Quintianus</name> and <name type="person">Senecio</name>, their chief friends, respectively, <name type="person">Glitius Gallus</name> 
and <name type="person">Annius Pollio</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p><name type="person">Nero</name>, meanwhile, 
remembering that <name type="person">Epicharis</name> was in custody on the information of <name type="person">Volusius 
Proculus</name>, and assuming that a woman's frame must be unequal to the agony, 
ordered her to be torn on the rack. But neither the scourge nor fire, nor 
the fury of the men as they increased the torture that they might not be a 
woman's scorn, overcame her positive denial of the charge. Thus the first 
day's inquiry was futile. On the morrow, as she was being dragged back on a 
chair to the same torments (for with her limbs all dislocated she could not 
stand), she tied a band, which she had stript off her bosom, in a sort of 
noose to the arched back of the chair, put her neck in it, and then 
straining with the whole weight of her body, wrung out of her frame its 
little remaining breath. All the nobler was the example set by a freedwoman 
at such a crisis in screening strangers and those whom she hardly knew, when 
freeborn men, Roman knights,

and senators, yet unscathed by torture, betrayed, every one, 
his dearest kinsfolk. For even <name type="person">Lucanus</name> and <name type="person">Senecio</name> and <name type="person">Quintianus</name> failed not 
to reveal their accomplices indiscriminately, and <name type="person">Nero</name> was more and more 
alarmed, though he had fenced his person with a largely augmented 
guard.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>Even <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> itself he put, so to say, under custody, 
garrisoning its walls with companies of soldiers and occupying with troops 
the coast and the river-banks. Incessantly were there flying through the 
public places, through private houses, country fields, and the neighbouring 
villages, horse and foot soldiers, mixed with <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, whom the emperor 
trusted as being foreigners. In long succession, troops of prisoners in 
chains were dragged along and stood at the gates of his gardens. When they 
entered to plead their cause, a smile of joy on any of the conspirators, a 
casual conversation, a sudden meeting, or the fact of having entered a 
banquet or a public show in company, was construed into a crime, while to 
the savage questionings of <name type="person">Nero</name> and <name type="person">Tigellinus</name> were added the violent 
menaces of <name type="person">F&aelig;nius Rufus</name>, who had not yet been named by the informers, 
but who, to get the credit of complete ignorance, frowned fiercely on his 
accomplices. When <name type="person">Subius Flavus</name> at his side asked him by a sign whether he 
should draw his sword in the middle of the trial and perpetrate the fatal 
deed, <name type="person">Rufus</name> refused, and checked the man's impulse as he was putting his 
hand to his sword-hilt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>Some there 
were who, as soon as the conspiracy was betrayed, urged <name type="person">Piso</name>, while 
<name type="person">Milichus</name>' story was being heard, and <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name> was hesitating, to go to 
the camp or mount the <rs type="placename">Rostra</rs> and test the feelings of the soldiers and of 
the people. "If," said they, "your accomplices join your enterprise, those 
also who are yet undecided, will follow, and great will be the fame of the 
movement once started, and this in any new scheme is all-powerful. Against 
it <name type="person">Nero</name> has taken no precaution. Even brave men are dismayed by sudden 
perils; far less will that stage-player, with <name type="person">Tigellinus</name> forsooth and his 
concubines in his train, raise arms against you. Many things are 
accomplished on trial which cowards think arduous. It is vain to expect 
secrecy and fidelity from the varying tempers and bodily constitutions of 
such a host of accomplices. Tor-

ture or reward can overcome 
everything. Men will soon come to put you also in chains and inflict on you 
an ignominious death. How much more gloriously will you die while you cling 
to the State and invoke aid for liberty. Rather let the soldiers fail, the 
people be traitors, provided that you, if prematurely robbed of life, 
justify your death to your ancestors and descendants." </p>
<p>Unmoved by these 
considerations, <name type="person">Piso</name> showed himself a few moments in public, then sought the 
retirement of his house, and there fortified his spirit against the worst, 
till a troop of soldiers arrived, raw recruits, or men recently enlisted, 
whom <name type="person">Nero</name> had selected, because he was afraid of the veterans, imbued, 
though they were, with a liking for him. <name type="person">Piso</name> expired by having the veins in 
his arms severed. His will, full of loathsome flatteries of Nero, was a 
concession to his love of his wife, a base woman, with only a beautiful 
person to recommend her, whom he had taken away from her husband, one of his 
friends. Her name was <name type="person">Atria Galla</name>; that of her former husband, <name type="person">Domitius 
Silus</name>. The tame spirit of the man, the profligacy of the woman, blazoned 
<name type="person">Piso</name>'s infamy.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p>In quick succession 
<name type="person">Nero</name> added the murder of <name type="person">Plautius Lateranus</name>, consul-elect, so promptly that 
he did not allow him to embrace his children or to have the brief choice of 
his own death. He was dragged off to a place set apart for the execution of 
slaves, and butchered by the hand of the tribune <name type="person">Statius</name>, maintaining a 
resolute silence, and not reproaching the tribune with complicity in the 
plot. </p>
<p>Then followed the destruction of <name type="person">Ann&aelig;us Seneca</name>, a special 
joy to the emperor, not because he had convicted him of the conspiracy, but 
anxious to accomplish with the sword what poison had failed to do. It was, 
in fact, <name type="person">Natalis</name> alone who divulged <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s name, to this extent, that he 
had been sent to <name type="person">Seneca</name> when ailing, to see him and remonstrate with him for 
excluding <name type="person">Piso</name> from his presence, when it would have been better to have 
kept up their friendship by familiar intercourse; that <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s reply was 
that mutual conversations and frequent interviews were to the advantage of 
neither, but still that his own life depended on <name type="person">Piso</name>'s safety. <name type="person">Gavius 
Silvanus</name>, tribune of a pr&aelig;torian cohort, was ordered

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SENECA'S LAST MOMENTS</note>
to report this to <name type="person">Seneca</name> and to 
ask him whether he acknowledged what <name type="person">Natalis</name> said and his own answer. Either 
by chance or purposely <name type="person">Seneca</name> had returned on that day from <rs type="placename">Campania</rs>, and had stopped at a country-house four miles 
from <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>. Thither the tribune came next evening, 
surrounded the house with troops of soldiers, and then made known the 
emperor's message to <name type="person">Seneca</name> as he was at dinner with his wife, <name type="person">Pompeia 
Paulina</name>, and two friends.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p><name type="person">Seneca</name> 
replied that <name type="person">Natalis</name> had been sent to him and had complained to him in 
<name type="person">Piso</name>'s name because of his refusal to see <name type="person">Piso</name>, upon which he excused 
himself on the ground of failing health and the desire of rest. "He had no 
reason," he said, for "preferring the interest of any private citizen to his 
own safety, and he had no natural aptitude for flattery. No one knew this 
better than <name type="person">Nero</name>, who had oftener experienced <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s freespokenness than 
his servility." When the tribune reported this answer in the presence of 
<name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> and <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, the emperor's most confidential advisers in his 
moments of rage, he asked whether <name type="person">Seneca</name> was meditating suicide. Upon this 
the tribune asserted that he saw no signs of fear, and perceived no sadness 
in his words or in his looks. He was accordingly ordered to go back and to 
announce sentence of death. <name type="person">Fabius Rusticus</name> tells us that he did not return 
the way he came, but went out of his course to <name type="person">F&aelig;nius</name>, the commander 
of the guard, and having explained to him the emperor's orders, and asked 
whether he was to obey them, was by him admonished to carry them out, for a 
fatal spell of cowardice was on them all. For this very <name type="person">Silvanus</name> was one of 
the conspirators, and he was now abetting the crimes which he had united 
with them to avenge. But he spared himself the anguish of a word or of a 
look, and merely sent in to <name type="person">Seneca</name> one of his centurions, who was to 
announce to him his last doom.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p><name type="person">Seneca</name>, 
quite unmoved, asked for tablets on which to inscribe his will, and, on the 
centurion's refusal, turned to his friends, protesting that as he was 
forbidden to requite them, he bequeathed to them the only, but still the 
noblest possession yet remaining to him, the pattern of his life, which, if 
they remembered, they would win a name for moral worth and steadfast 
friendship. At the same time he called

them back from their tears 
to manly resolution, now with friendly talk, and now with the sterner 
language of rebuke. "Where," he asked again and again, "are your maxims of 
philosophy, or the preparation of so many years' study against evils to 
come? Who knew not <name type="person">Nero</name>'s cruelty? After a mother's and a brother's murder, 
nothing remains but to add the destruction of a guardian and a 
tutor."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>Having spoken these and like 
words, meant, so to say, for all, he embraced his wife; then softening 
awhile from the stern resolution of the hour, he begged and implored her to 
spare herself the burden of perpetual sorrow, and, in the contemplation of a 
life virtuously spent, to endure a husband's loss with honourable 
consolations. She declared, in answer, that she too had decided to die, and 
claimed for herself the blow of the executioner. Thereupon <name type="person">Seneca</name>, not to 
thwart her noble ambition, from an affection too which would not leave 
behind him for insult one whom he dearly loved, replied: "I have shown you 
ways of smoothing life; you prefer the glory of dying. I will not grudge you 
such a noble example. Let the fortitude of so courageous an end be alike in 
both of us, but let there be more in your decease to win fame." </p>
<p>Then by 
one and the same stroke they sundered with a dagger the arteries of their 
arms. <name type="person">Seneca</name>, as his aged frame, attenuated by frugal diet, allowed the 
blood to escape but slowly, severed also the veins of his legs and knees. 
Worn out by cruel anguish, afraid too that his sufferings might break his 
wife's spirit, and that, as he looked on her tortures, he might himself sink 
into irresolution, he persuaded her to retire into another chamber. Even at 
the last moment his eloquence failed him not; he summoned his secretaries, 
and dictated much to them which, as it has been published for all readers in 
his own words, I forbear to paraphrase.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> meanwhile, having no personal hatred against <name type="person">Paulina</name> and 
not wishing to heighten the odium of his cruelty, forbade her death. At the 
soldiers' prompting, her slaves and freedmen bound up her arms, and stanched 
the bleeding, whether with her knowledge is doubtful. For as the vulgar are 
ever ready to think the worst, there were persons who believed that, as long 
as she dreaded <name type="person">Nero</name>'s relentlessness,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">SENECA'S 
DEATH</note>
she sought the glory of sharing her husband's death, but that 
after a time, when a more soothing prospect presented itself, she yielded to 
the charms of life. To this she added a few subsequent years, with a most 
praiseworthy remembrance of her husband, and with a countenance and frame 
white to a degree of pallor which denoted a loss of much vital energy. 
</p>
<p><name type="person">Seneca</name> meantime, as the tedious process of death still lingered on, 
begged <name type="person">Statius Ann&aelig;us</name>, whom he had long esteemed for his faithful 
friendship and medical skill, to produce a poison with which he had some 
time before provided himself, the same drug which extinguished the life of 
those who were condemned by a public sentence of the people of <rs type="placename">Athens</rs>. It was brought to him and he drank it in vain, 
chilled as he was throughout his limbs, and his frame closed against the 
efficacy of the poison. At last he entered a pool of heated water, from 
which he sprinkled the nearest of his slaves, adding the exclamation, "I 
offer this liquid as a libation to <name type="person">Jupiter</name> the Deliverer." He was then 
carried into a bath, with the steam of which he was suffocated, and he was 
burnt without any of the usual funeral rites. So he had directed in a 
codicil of his will, when even in the height of his wealth and power he was 
thinking of his life's close.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>There 
was a rumour that <name type="person">Sabrius Flavus</name> had held a secret consultation with the 
centurions, and had planned, not without <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s knowledge, that when <name type="person">Nero</name> 
had been slain by <name type="person">Piso</name>'s instrumentality, <name type="person">Piso</name> also was to be murdered, and 
the empire handed over to <name type="person">Seneca</name>, as a man singled out for his splendid 
virtues by all persons of integrity. Even a saying of <name type="person">Flavus</name> was popularly 
current, "that it mattered not as to the disgrace if a harp-player were 
removed and a tragic actor succeeded him." For as <name type="person">Nero</name> used to sing to the 
harp, so did <name type="person">Piso</name> in the dress of a tragedian.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>The soldiers' part too in the conspiracy no longer escaped 
discovery, some in their rage becoming informers to betray <name type="person">F&aelig;nius 
Rufus</name>, whom they could not endure to be both an accomplice and a judge. 
Accordingly <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name>, in answer to his browbeating and menaces, said 
with a smile that no one knew more than he did, and actually urged him to 
show gratitude to so good a prince. <name type="person">F&aelig;nius</name> could not meet

this with either speech or silence. Halting in his words and visibly 
terror-stricken, while the rest, especially <name type="person">Cervarius Proculus</name>, a Roman 
knight, did their utmost to convict him, he was, at the emperor's bidding, 
seized and bound by <name type="person">Cassius</name>, a soldier, who because of his well-known 
strength of limb was in attendance.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p>Shortly afterwards, the information of the same men proved fatal to <name type="person">Subrius 
Flavus</name>. At first he grounded his defence on his moral contrast to the 
others, implying that an armed soldier, like himself, would never have 
shared such an attempt with unarmed and effeminate associates. Then, when he 
was pressed, he embraced the glory of a full confession. Questioned by <name type="person">Nero</name> 
as to the motives which had led him on to forget his oath of allegiance, "I 
hated you," he replied; "yet not a soldier was more loyal to you while you 
deserved to be loved. I began to hate you when you became the murderer of 
your mother and your wife, a charioteer, an actor, and an incendiary." I 
have given the man's very words, because they were not, like those of 
<name type="person">Seneca</name>, generally published, though the rough and vigorous sentiments of a 
soldier ought to be no less known. </p>
<p>Throughout the conspiracy nothing, it 
was certain, fell with more terror on the ears of <name type="person">Nero</name>, who was as unused to 
be told of the crimes he perpetrated as he was eager in their perpetration. 
The punishment of <name type="person">Flavus</name> was intrusted to <name type="person">Veianius Niger</name>, a tribune. At his 
direction, a pit was dug in a neighbouring field. <name type="person">Flavus</name>, on seeing it, 
censured it as too shallow and confined, saying to the soldiers around him, 
"Even this is not according to military rule." When bidden to offer his neck 
resolutely, "I wish," said he, "that your stroke may be as resolute." The 
tribune trembled greatly, and having only just severed his head at two 
blows, vaunted his brutality to <name type="person">Nero</name>, saying that he had slain him with a 
blow and a half.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p><name type="person">Sulpicius Asper</name>, a 
centurion, exhibited the next example of fortitude. To <name type="person">Nero</name>'s question why 
he had conspired to murder him, he briefly replied that he could not have 
rendered a better service to his infamous career. He then underwent the 
prescribed penalty. Nor did the remaining centurions forget their courage in 
suffering their punish-

ment. But <name type="person">F&aelig;nius Rufus</name> had not equal spirit; he even 
put his laments into his will. </p>
<p><name type="person">Nero</name> waited in the hope that <name type="person">Vestinus</name> 
also, the consul, whom he thought an impetuous and deeply disaffected man, 
would be involved in the charge. None however of the conspirators had shared 
their counsels with him, some from old feuds against him, most because they 
considered him a reckless and dangerous associate. <name type="person">Nero</name>'s hatred of him had 
had its origin in intimate companionship, <name type="person">Vestinus</name> seeing through and 
despising the emperor's cowardice, while <name type="person">Nero</name> feared the high spirit of his 
friend, who often bantered him with that rough humour which, when it draws 
largely on facts, leaves a bitter memory behind it. There was too a recent 
aggravation in the circumstance of <name type="person">Vestinus</name> having married <name type="person">Statilia 
Messalina</name>, without being ignorant that the emperor was one of her 
paramours.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p>As neither crime nor 
accuser appeared, <name type="person">Nero</name>, being thus unable to assume the semblance of a 
judge, had recourse to the sheer might of despotism, and despatched 
<name type="person">Gerellanus</name>, a tribune, with a cohort of soldiers, and with orders to 
forestall the designs of the consul, to seize what he might call his 
fortress, and crush his train of chosen youths. For <name type="person">Vestinus</name> had a house 
towering over the <rs type="placename">Forum</rs>, and a host of handsome slaves of the same age. On 
that day he had performed all his duties as consul, and was entertaining 
some guests, fearless of danger, or perhaps by way of hiding his fears, when 
the soldiers entered and announced to him the tribune's summons. He rose 
without a moment's delay, and every preparation was at once made. He shut 
himself into his chamber; a physician was at his side; his veins were 
opened; with life still strong in him, he was carried into a bath, and 
plunged into warm water, without uttering a word of pity for himself. 
Meanwhile the guards surrounded those who had sat at his table, and it was 
only at a late hour of the night that they were dismissed, when <name type="person">Nero</name>, having 
pictured to himself and laughed over their terror at the expectation of a 
fatal end to their banquet, said that they had suffered enough punishment 
for the consul's entertainment.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p>Next 
he ordered the destruction of <name type="person">Marcus Ann&aelig;us Lucanus</name>. As the blood 
flowed freely from him, and he felt a

chill creeping through his 
feet and hands, and the life gradually ebbing from his extremities, though 
the heart was still warm and he retained his mental power, <name type="person">Lucanus</name> recalled 
some poetry he had composed in which he had told the story of a wounded 
soldier dying a similar kind of death, and he recited the very lines. These 
were his last words. After him, <name type="person">Senecio</name>, <name type="person">Quintianus</name>, and <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name> 
perished, not in the manner expected from the past effeminacy of their life, 
and then the remaining conspirators, without deed or word deserving 
record.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p><rs type="placename">Rome</rs> 
all this time was thronged with funerals, the <rs type="placename">Capitol</rs> with sacrificial 
victims. One after another, on the destruction of a brother, a kinsman, or a 
friend, would return thanks to the gods, deck his house with laurels, 
prostrate himself at the knees of the emperor, and weary his hand with 
kisses. He, in the belief that this was rejoicing, rewarded with impunity 
the prompt informations of <name type="person">Antonius Natalis</name> and <name type="person">Cervarius Proculus</name>. <name type="person">Milichus</name> 
was enriched with gifts and assumed in its Greek equivalent the name of 
Saviour. Of the tribunes, <name type="person">Gavius Silvanus</name>, though acquitted, perished by his 
own hand; <name type="person">Statius Proximus</name> threw away the benefit of the pardon he had 
accepted from the emperor by the folly of his end. <name type="person">Cornelius Martialis</name>, 
<name type="person">Flavius Nepos</name>, <name type="person">Statius Domitius</name> were then deprived of the tribuneship, on 
the ground, not of actually hating the emperor, but of having the credit of 
it. <name type="person">Novius Priscus</name>, as <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s friend, <name type="person">Glitius Gallus</name>, and <name type="person">Annius Pollio</name>, 
as men disgraced rather than convicted, escaped with sentences of 
banishment. <name type="person">Priscus</name> and <name type="person">Gallus</name> were accompanied respectively by their wives, 
<name type="person">Artoria Flaccilla</name> and <name type="person">Egnatia Maximilla</name>. The latter possessed at first a 
great fortune, still unimpaired, and was subsequently deprived of it, both 
which circumstances enhanced her fame. </p>
<p><name type="person">Rufius Crispinus</name> too was 
banished, on the opportune pretext of the conspiracy, but he was in fact 
hated by <name type="person">Nero</name>, because he had once been <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>'s husband. It was the 
splendour of their name which drove <name type="person">Verginius Flavus</name> and <name type="person">Musonius Rufus</name> into 
exile. <name type="person">Verginius</name> encouraged the studies of our youth by his eloquence; <name type="person">Rufus</name> 
by the teachings of philosophy. <name type="person">Cluvidienus Quietus</name>, <name type="person">Julius Agrippa</name>, <name type="person">Blitius

<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>All this having been 
completed, <name type="person">Nero </name>assembled the troops and distributed two thousand sesterces 
to every common soldier, with an addition of as much corn without payment, 
as they had previously the use of at the market price. Then, as if he was 
going to describe successes in war, he summoned the Senate, and awarded 
triumphal honours to <name type="person">Petronius Turpilianus</name>, an ex-consul, to <name type="person">Cocceius Nerva</name>, 
pr&aelig;tor-elect, and to <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, commander of the pr&aelig;torians. 
<name type="person">Tigellinus</name> and <name type="person">Nerva</name> he so distinguished as to place busts of them in the 
palace in addition to triumphal statues in the <rs type="placename">Forum</rs>. He granted a consul's 
decorations to <name type="person">Nymphidius</name>, on whose origin, as he now appears for the first 
time, I will briefly touch. For he too will be a part of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>'s calamities. 
</p>
<p>The son of a freedwoman, who had prostituted a handsome person among the 
slaves and freedmen of the emperors, he gave out that he was the offspring 
of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, for he happened to be of tall stature and to have a 
fierce look, or possibly <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>, who liked even harlots, had also 
amused himself with the man's mother.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> meanwhile summoned the Senate, addressed them in a speech, and further 
added a proclamation to the people, with the evidence which had been entered 
on records, and the confessions of the condemned. He was indeed perpetually 
under the lash of popular talk, which said that he had destroyed men 
perfectly innocent out of jealousy or fear. However, that a conspiracy was 
begun, matured, and conclusively proved was not doubted at the time by those 
who took pains to ascertain the truth, and is admitted by those who after 
<name type="person">Nero</name>'s death returned to the capital. When every one in the Senate, those 
especially who had most cause to mourn, abased himself in flattery, <name type="person">Salienus 
Clemens</name> denounced <name type="person">Junius Gallio</name>, who was terror-stricken at his

brother <name type="person">Seneca</name>'s death and was pleading for his life. He called him 
an enemy and traitor to the State, till the unanimous voice of the senators 
deterred him from perverting public miseries into an occasion for a personal 
resentment, and thus importing fresh bitterness into what by the prince's 
clemency had been hushed up or forgotten.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>Then offerings and thanksgivings to the gods were decreed, with 
special honours to the Sun, who has an ancient temple in the circus where 
the crime was planned, as having revealed by his power the secrets of the 
conspiracy. The games too of <name type="person">Ceres</name> in the circus were to be celebrated with 
more horse-races, and the month of April was to be called after the name of 
<name type="person">Nero</name>. A temple also was to be erected to Safety, on the spot whence 
<name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name> had taken his dagger. The emperor himself dedicated the 
weapon in the temple of the capital, and inscribed on it, "To <name type="person">Jupiter</name> the 
Avenger." This passed without notice at the moment, but after the war of 
<name type="person">Julius Vindex</name> it was construed as an omen and presage of impending 
vengeance. I find in the registers of the Senate that <name type="person">Cerialis Anicius</name>, 
consul-elect, proposed a motion that a temple should as soon as possible be 
built at the public expense to the Divine <name type="person">Nero</name>. He implied indeed by this 
proposal that the prince had transcended all mortal grandeur and deserved 
the adoration of mankind. Some however interpreted it as an omen of his 
death, seeing that divine honours are not paid to an emperor till he has 
ceased to live among men.</p></div2></div1>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>FORTUNE soon afterwards made a dupe of <name type="person">Nero</name> through his own credulity and 
the promises of <name type="person">C&aelig;sellius Bassus</name>, a <name type="ethnic">Carthaginian</name> by birth and a man of 
a crazed imagination, who wrested a vision seen in the slumber of night into 
a confident expectation. He sailed to <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, and 
having purchased admission to the emperor, he explained how he had 
discovered on his land a cave of immense depth, which contained a vast 
quantity of gold, not in the form of coin, but in the shapeless and 
ponderous masses of ancient days. In fact, he said, ingots of great weight 
lay there, with bars standing near them in another part of the cave, a 
treasure hidden for so many ages to increase the wealth of the present. 
Ph&oelig;nician <name type="person">Dido</name>, as he sought to show by inference, after fleeing from 
<rs type="placename">Tyre</rs> and founding <rs type="placename">Carthage</rs>, had concealed these riches in

money, or that the Numidian kings, already for other reasons hostile, might 
by lust of gold be provoked to war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> upon this, without sufficiently examining the credibility of the author 
of the story, or of the matter itself, or sending persons through whom he 
might ascertain whether the intelligence was true, himself actually 
encouraged the report and despatched men to bring the spoil, as if it were 
already acquired. They had triremes assigned them and crews specially 
selected to promote speed. Nothing else at the time was the subject of the 
credulous gossip of the people, and of the very different conversation of 
thinking persons. It happened, too, that the quinquennial games were being 
celebrated for the second time, and the orators took from this same incident 
their chief materials for eulogies on the emperor. "Not only," they said, 
"were there the usual

harvests, and the gold of the mine with its 
alloy, but the earth now teemed with a new abundance, and wealth was thrust 
on them by the bounty of the gods." These and other servile flatteries they 
invented, with consummate eloquence and equal sycophancy, confidently 
counting on the facility of his belief.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>Extravagance meanwhile increased, on the strength of a chimerical hope, and 
ancient wealth was wasted, as apparently the emperor had lighted on 
treasures he might squander for many a year. He even gave away profusely 
from this source, and the expectation of riches was one of the causes of the 
poverty of the State. <name type="person">Bassus</name> indeed dug up his land and extensive plains in 
the neighbourhood, while he persisted that this or that was the place of the 
promised cave, and was followed not only by our soldiers but by the rustic 
population who were engaged to execute the work, till at last he threw off 
his infatuation, and expressing wonder that his dreams had never before been 
false, and that now for the first time he had been deluded, he escaped 
disgrace and danger by a voluntary death. Some have said that he was 
imprisoned and soon released, his property having been taken from him as a 
substitute for the royal treasure.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>Meanwhile the Senate, as they were now on the eve of the quinquennial 
contest, wishing to avert scandal, offered the emperor the "victory in 
song," and added the "crown of eloquence," that thus a veil might be thrown 
over a shameful exposure on the stage. <name type="person">Nero</name>, however, repeatedly declared 
that he wanted neither favour nor the Senate's influence, as he was a match 
for his rivals, and was certain, in the conscientious opinion of the judges, 
to win the honour by merit. First, he recited a poem on the stage; then, at 
the importunate request of the rabble that he would make public property of 
all his accomplishments (these were their words), he entered the theatre, 
and conformed to all the laws of harp-playing, not sitting down when tired, 
nor wiping off the perspiration with anything but the garment he wore, or 
letting himself be seen to spit or clear his nostrils. Last of all, on 
bended knee he saluted the assembly with a motion of the hand, and awaited 
the verdict of the judges with pretended anxiety. And then the 
city-populace, who

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">NERO COMPETES FOR PRIZES</note>
were 
wont to encourage every gesture even of actors, made the place ring with 
measured strains of elaborate applause. One would have thought they were 
rejoicing, and perhaps they did rejoice, in their indifference to the public 
disgrace.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>All, however, who were 
present from remote towns, and still retained the <rs type="placename">Italy</rs> of strict morals and primitive ways; all too who 
had come on embassies or on private business from distant provinces, where 
they had been unused to such wantonness, were unable to endure the spectacle 
or sustain the degrading fatigue, which wearied their unpractised hands, 
while they disturbed those who knew their part, and were often struck by 
soldiers, stationed in the seats, to see that not a moment of time passed 
with less vigorous applause or in the silence of indifference. It was a 
known fact that several knights, in struggling through the narrow approaches 
and the pressure of the crowd, were trampled to death, and that others while 
keeping their seats day and night were seized with some fatal malady. For it 
was a still worse danger to be absent from the show, as many openly and many 
more secretly made it their business to scrutinize names and faces, and to 
note the delight or the disgust of the company. Hence came cruel severities, 
immediately exercised on the humble, and resentments, concealed for the 
moment, but subsequently paid off, towards men of distinction. There was a 
story that <name type="person">Vespasian</name> was insulted by <name type="person">Ph&oelig;bus</name>, a freedman, for closing 
his eyes in a doze, and that having with difficulty been screened by the 
intercessions of the well disposed, he escaped imminent destruction through 
his grander destiny.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>After the 
conclusion of the games <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name> died from a casual outburst of rage in 
her husband, who felled her with a kick when she was pregnant. That there 
was poison I cannot believe, though some writers so relate, from hatred 
rather than from belief, for the emperor was desirous of children, and 
wholly swayed by love of his wife. Her body was not consumed by fire 
according to Roman usage, but after the custom of foreign princes was filled 
with fragrant spices and embalmed, and then consigned to the sepulchre of 
the Julii. She had, however, a public funeral, and <name type="person">Nero</name> himself from the 
<rs type="placename">rostra</rs> eulogized her beauty, her lot in hav-

ing been the mother 
of a deified child, and fortune's other gifts, as though they were 
virtues.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>To the death of <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>, 
which, though a public grief, was a delight to those who recalling the past 
thought of her shamelessness and cruelty, <name type="person">Nero</name> added fresh and greater odium 
by forbidding <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name> to attend the funeral. This was the first token 
of mischief. Nor was it long delayed. <name type="person">Silanus</name> was coupled with <name type="person">Cassius</name>, no 
crime being alleged, but that <name type="person">Cassius</name> was eminent for his ancestral wealth 
and dignity of character, <name type="person">Silanus</name> for the nobility of his birth and the 
quiet demeanour of his youth. The emperor accordingly sent the Senate a 
speech in which he argued that both ought to be removed from the State, and 
made it a reproach against <name type="person">Cassius</name> that among his ancestors' busts he had 
specially revered that of <name type="person">Caius Cassius</name>, which bore the inscription "to the 
Party-Leader." In fact, he had thereby sought to sow the seeds of civil war 
and revolt from the House of the C&aelig;sars. And that he might not merely 
avail himself of the memory of a hated name to stir up strife, he had 
associated with him <name type="person">Lucius Silanus</name>, a youth of noble birth and reckless 
spirit, to whom he might point as an instrument of revolution.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> next denounced <name type="person">Silanus</name> himself in the same terms 
as he had his uncle <name type="person">Torquatus</name>, implying that he was already arranging the 
details of imperial business, and setting freedmen to manage his accounts, 
papers, and correspondence, imputations utterly groundless and false. 
<name type="person">Silanus</name>, in truth, was intensely apprehensive, and had been frightened into 
caution by his uncle's destruction. <name type="person">Nero</name> then procured persons, under the 
name of informers, to invent against <name type="person">Lepida</name>, the wife of <name type="person">Cassius</name> and aunt of 
<name type="person">Silanus</name>, a charge of incest with her brother's son, and of some ghastly 
religious ceremonial. <name type="person">Volcatius Tullinus</name>, and <name type="person">Marcellus Cornelius</name>, senators, 
and <name type="person">Fabatus</name>, a Roman knight, were drawn in as accomplices. By an appeal to 
the emperor these men eluded an impending doom and subsequently, as being 
too insignificant, escaped from <name type="person">Nero</name>, who was busy with crimes on a far 
greater scale.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>The Senate was then 
consulted and sentences of exile were passed on <name type="person">Cassius</name> and <name type="person">Silanus</name>. As to 
<name type="person">Lepida</name>, the em-

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">POPP&AElig;A'S DEATH; 
EXECUTIONS</note>
peror was to decide. <name type="person">Cassius</name> was transported to the island 
of <rs type="placename">Sardinia</rs>, and he was quietly left to old age. 
<name type="person">Silanus</name> was removed to <rs type="placename">Ostia</rs>, whence, it was 
pretended, he was to be conveyed to <rs type="placename">Naxos</rs>. He was afterwards confined in a town of <rs type="placename">Apulia</rs> named <rs type="placename">Barium</rs>. There, as he was wisely enduring a 
most undeserved calamity, he was suddenly seized by a centurion sent to slay 
him. When the man advised him to sever his veins, he replied that, though he 
had resolved in his heart to die, he would not let a cutthroat have the 
glory of the service. The centurion seeing that, unarmed as he was, he was 
very powerful, and more like an enraged than a frightened man, ordered his 
soldiers to overpower him. And <name type="person">Silanus</name> failed not to resist and to strike 
blows, as well as he could with his bare hands, till he was cut down by the 
centurion, as though in battle, with wounds in his breast.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>With equal courage <name type="person">Lucius Vetus</name>, his mother-in-law 
<name type="person">Sextia</name>, and his daughter <name type="person">Pollutia</name> submitted to death. They were hated by the 
emperor because they seemed a living reproach to him for the murder of 
<name type="person">Rubellius Plautus</name>, son-in-law of <name type="person">Lucius Vetus</name>. But the first opportunity of 
unmasking his savage wrath was furnished by <name type="person">Fortunatus</name>, a freedman, who 
having embezzled his patron's property, deserted him to become his accuser. 
He had as his accomplice <name type="person">Claudius Demianus</name>, whom <name type="person">Vetus</name>, when proconsul of 
<rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, had imprisoned for his gross misdeeds, and 
whom <name type="person">Nero</name> now released as a recompense for the accusation. </p>
<p>When the 
accused knew this and saw that he and his freedman were pitted against each 
other on an equal footing, he retired to his estate at <rs type="placename">Formi&aelig;</rs>. There he was put under the secret 
surveillance of soldiers. With him was his daughter, who, to say nothing of 
the now imminent peril, had all the fury of a long grief ever since she had 
seen the murderers of her husband <name type="person">Plautus</name>. She had clasped his bleeding 
neck, and still kept by her the blood-stained apparel, clinging in her 
widowhood to perpetual sorrow, and using only such nourishment as might 
suffice to avert starvation. Then at her father's bidding she went to <rs type="placename">Neapolis</rs>. And as she was forbidden to approach <name type="person">Nero</name>, she 
would haunt his doors and implore him to hear an innocent man, and not 
surrender to a freedman one who had once been his colleague in the con-

sulship, now pleading with the cries of a woman, now again forgetting 
her sex and lifting up her voice in a tone of menace, till the emperor 
showed himself unmoved alike by entreaty and reproach.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>She therefore told her father by message that she 
cast hope aside and yielded to necessity. He was at the same time informed 
that judicial proceedings in the Senate and a dreadful sentence were hanging 
over him. Some there were who advised him to name the emperor as his chief 
heir, and so secure the remainder for his grandchildren. But he spurned the 
notion, and unwilling to disgrace a life which had clung to freedom by a 
final act of servility, he bestowed on his slaves all his ready money, and 
ordered each to convey away for himself whatever he could carry, leaving 
only three couches for the last scene. Then in the same chamber, with the 
same weapon, they sundered their veins, and speedily hurried into a bath, 
covered each, as delicacy required, with a single garment, the father gazing 
intently on his daughter, the grandmother on her grandchild, she again on 
both, while with rival earnestness they prayed that the ebbing life might 
have a quick departure, each wishing to leave a relative still surviving, 
but just on the verge of death. Fortune preserved the due order; the oldest 
died first, then the others according to priority of age. They were 
prosecuted after their burial, and the sentence was that "they should be 
punished in ancient fashion." <name type="person">Nero</name> interposed his veto, allowing them to die 
without his interference. Such were the mockeries added to murders already 
perpetrated.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p><name type="person">Publius Gallus</name>, a Roman 
knight, was outlawed for having been intimate with <name type="person">F&aelig;nius Rufus</name> and 
somewhat acquainted with <name type="person">Vetus</name>. To the freedman who was the accuser, was 
given, as a reward for his service, a seat in the theatre among the 
tribune's officers. The month too following April, or Neroneus, was changed 
from Maius into the name of <name type="person">Claudius</name>, and Junius into that of <name type="person">Germanicus</name>, 
<name type="person">Cornelius Orfitus</name>, the proposer of the motion, publicly declaring that the 
month Junius had been passed over because the execution of the two Torquati 
for their crimes had now rendered its name inauspicious.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>A year of shame and of so many evil deeds 
heaven
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">POLLUTIA'S FORTITUDE; STORM AND PLAGUE</note>
also 
marked by storms and pestilence. <rs type="placename">Campania</rs> was 
devastated by a hurricane, which destroyed everywhere country-houses, 
plantations and crops, and carried its fury to the neighbourhood of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>, where a terrible plague was sweeping away all 
classes of human beings without any such derangement of the atmosphere as to 
be visibly apparent. Yet the houses were filled with lifeless forms and the 
streets with funerals. Neither age nor sex was exempt from peril. Slaves and 
the free-born populace alike were suddenly cut off, amid the wailings of 
wives and children, who were often consumed on the very funeral pile of 
their friends by whom they had been sitting and shedding tears. Knights and 
senators perished indiscriminately, and yet their deaths were less deplored 
because they seemed to forestal the emperor's cruelty by an ordinary death. 
That same year levies of troops were held in <rs type="placename">Narbon 
Gaul</rs>, <rs type="placename">Africa</rs> and <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, 
to fill up the legions of <rs type="placename">Illyricum</rs>, all soldiers in 
which, worn out by age or ill-health, were receiving their discharge. 
<rs type="placename">Lugdunum</rs> was consoled by the prince for a ruinous disaster by a gift of four 
million sesterces, so that what was lost to the city might be replaced. Its 
people had previously offered this same amount for the distresses of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>In the 
consulship of <name type="person">Caius Suetonius</name> and <name type="person">Lucius Telesinus</name>, <name type="person">Antistius Sosianus</name>, who, 
as I have stated, had been punished with exile for repeated satires on <name type="person">Nero</name>, 
having heard that there was such honour for informers and that the emperor 
was so partial to bloodshed, being himself too of a restless temper and 
quick to seize opportunities, made a friend of a man in like condition with 
himself, one Pammenes, an exile in the same place, noted for his skill as an 
astrologer, and consequently bound to many in close intimacy. He thought 
there must be a meaning in the frequent messages and the consultations, and 
he learnt at the same time that an annual payment was furnished him by 
<name type="person">Publius Anteius</name>. He knew too that <name type="person">Anteius</name> was hated by <name type="person">Nero</name> for his love of 
<name type="person">Agrippina</name>, and that his wealth was sufficiently conspicuous to provoke 
cupidity, and that this was the cause of the destruction of many. 
Accordingly he intercepted a letter from Anteius, and having also stolen 
some notes about the day of his nativity and his future career, which 
were

hidden away among <name type="person">Pammenes</name>' secret papers, and having 
further discovered some remarks on the birth and life of <name type="person">Ostorius Scapula</name>, 
he wrote to the emperor that he would communicate important news which would 
contribute to his safety, if he could but obtain a brief reprieve of his 
exile. <name type="person">Anteius</name> and <name type="person">Ostorius</name> were, he hinted, grasping at empire and prying 
into the destinies of themselves and of the prince. Some swift galleys were 
then despatched and <name type="person">Sosianus</name> speedily arrived. On the disclosure of his 
information, <name type="person">Anteius</name> and <name type="person">Ostorius</name> were classed with condemned criminals 
rather than with men on their trial, so completely, indeed, that no one 
would attest the will of <name type="person">Anteius</name>, till <name type="person">Tigellinus</name> interposed to sanction it. 
<name type="person">Anteius</name> had been previously advised by him not to delay this final document. 
Then he drank poison, but disgusted at its slowness, he hastened death by 
severing his veins.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p><name type="person">Ostorius</name> was 
living at the time on a remote estate on the Ligurian frontier. Thither a 
centurion was despatched to hurry on his destruction. There was a motive for 
promptitude arising out of the fact that <name type="person">Ostorius</name>, with his great military 
fame and the civic crown he had won in <rs type="placename">Britain</rs>, 
possessed, too, as he was of huge bodily strength and skill in arms, had 
made <name type="person">Nero</name>, who was always timid and now more frightened than ever by the 
lately discovered conspiracy, fearful of a sudden attack. So the centurion, 
having barred every exit from the house, disclosed the emperor's orders to 
<name type="person">Ostorius</name>. That fortitude which he had often shown in fighting the enemy 
<name type="person">Ostorius</name> now turned against himself. And as his veins, though severed, 
allowed but a scanty flow of blood, he used the help of a slave, simply to 
hold up a dagger firmly, and then pressing the man's hand towards him, he 
met the point with his throat.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>Even 
if I had to relate foreign wars and deaths encountered in the service of the 
State with such a monotony of disaster, I should myself have been overcome 
by disgust, while I should look for weariness in my readers, sickened as 
they would be by the melancholy and continuous destruction of our citizens, 
however glorious to themselves. But now a servile submissiveness and so much 
wanton bloodshed at home fatigue the mind and paralyze it with grief. The 
only

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">GRIM MONOTONY OF EVENTS</note>
indulgence I would ask 
from those who will acquaint themselves with these horrors is that I be not 
thought to hate men who perished so tamely. Such was the wrath of heaven 
against the Roman State that one may not pass over it with a single mention, 
as one might the defeat of armies and the capture of cities. Let us grant 
this privilege to the posterity of illustrious men, that just as in their 
funeral obsequies such men are not confounded in a common burial, so in the 
record of their end they may receive and retain a special memorial.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>Within a few days, in quick succession, 
<name type="person">Ann&aelig;us Mela</name>, <name type="person">Cerialis Anicius</name>, <name type="person">Rufius Crispinus</name>, and <name type="person">Petronius</name> fell, 
<name type="person">Mela</name> and <name type="person">Crispinus</name> being Roman knights with senatorian rank. The latter had 
once commanded the pr&aelig;torians and had been rewarded with the 
decorations of the consulate. He had lately been banished to <rs type="placename">Sardinia</rs> on a charge of conspiracy, and on receiving a 
message that he was doomed to die had destroyed himself. <name type="person">Mela</name>, son of the 
same parents as <name type="person">Gallio</name> and <name type="person">Seneca</name>, had refrained from seeking promotion out 
of a perverse vanity which wished to raise a Roman knight to an equality 
with ex-consuls. He also thought that there was a shorter road to the 
acquisition of wealth through offices connected with the administration of 
the emperor's private business. He had too in his son <name type="person">Ann&aelig;us Lucanus</name> a 
powerful aid in rising to distinction. After the death of <name type="person">Lucanus</name>, he 
rigorously called in the debts due to his estate, and thereby provoked an 
accuser in the person of <name type="person">Fabius Romanus</name>, one of the intimate friends of 
<name type="person">Lucanus</name>. A story was invented that the father and son shared between them a 
knowledge of the conspiracy, and a letter was forged in <name type="person">Lucanus</name>'s name. This 
<name type="person">Nero</name> examined, and ordered it to be conveyed to <name type="person">Mela</name>, whose wealth he 
ravenously desired. <name type="person">Mela</name> meanwhile, adopting the easiest mode of death then 
in fashion, opened his veins, after adding a codicil to his will bequeathing 
an immense amount to <name type="person">Tigellinus</name> and his son-in-law, <name type="person">Cossutianus Capito</name>, in 
order to save the remainder. In this codicil he is also said to have 
written, by way of remonstrance against the injustice of his death, that he 
died without any cause for punishment, while <name type="person">Rufius Crispinus</name> and <name type="person">Anicius 
Cerialis</name> still enjoyed life, though bitter foes to the prince. It was 
thought that he had invented this about <name type="person">Crispinus</name>, because the man

had been already murdered; about <name type="person">Cerialis</name>, with the object of 
procuring his murder. Soon afterwards <name type="person">Cerialis</name> laid violent hands on 
himself, and received less pity than the others, because men remembered that 
he had betrayed a conspiracy to <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>With regard to <name type="person">Caius Petronius</name>, I ought to dwell a 
little on his antecedents. His days he passed in sleep, his nights in the 
business and pleasures of life. Indolence had raised him to fame, as energy 
raises others, and he was reckoned not a debauchee and spendthrift, like 
most of those who squander their substance, but a man of refined luxury. And 
indeed his talk and his doings, the freer they were and the more show of 
carelessness they exhibited, were the better liked, for their look of 
natural simplicity. Yet as proconsul of <rs type="placename">Bithynia</rs> and soon afterwards as consul, he showed himself a man of vigour and equal 
to business. Then falling back into vice or affecting vice, he was chosen by 
<name type="person">Nero</name> to be one of his few intimate associates, as a critic in matters of 
taste, while the emperor thought nothing charming or elegant in luxury 
unless <name type="person">Petronius</name> had expressed to him his approval of it. Hence jealousy on 
the part of <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, who looked on him as a rival and even his superior 
in the science of pleasure. And so he worked on the prince's cruelty, which 
dominated every other passion, charging <name type="person">Petronius</name> with having been the 
friend of <name type="person">Sc&aelig;vinus</name>, bribing a slave to become informer, robbing him of 
the means of defence, and hurrying into prison the greater part of his 
domestics.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>It happened at the time 
that the emperor was on his way to <rs type="placename">Campania</rs> and that 
<name type="person">Petronius</name>, after going as far as <rs type="placename">Cum&aelig;</rs>, was there detained. He bore no 
longer the suspense of fear or of hope. Yet he did not fling away life with 
precipitate haste, but having made an incision in his veins and then, 
according to his humour, bound them up, he again opened them, while he 
conversed with his friends, not in a serious strain or on topics that might 
win for him the glory of courage. And he listened to them as they repeated, 
not thoughts on the immortality of the soul or on the theories of 
philosophers, but light poetry and playful verses. To some of his slaves he 
gave liberal presents, a flogging to others. He dined, indulged himself in 
sleep, that death, though forced

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">END OF PETRONIUS</note>
on 
him, might have a natural appearance. Even in his will he did not, as did 
many in their last moments, flatter <name type="person">Nero</name> or <name type="person">Tigellinus</name> or any other of the 
men in power. On the contrary, he described fully the prince's shameful 
excesses, with the names of his male and female companions and their 
novelties in debauchery, and sent the account under seal to <name type="person">Nero</name>. Then he 
broke his signet-ring, that it might not be subsequently available for 
imperilling others.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>When <name type="person">Nero</name> was in 
doubt how the ingenious varieties of his nightly revels became notorious, 
<name type="person">Silia</name> came into his mind, who, as a senator's wife, was a conspicuous 
person, and who had been his chosen associate in all his profligacy and was 
very intimate with <name type="person">Petronius</name>. She was banished for not having, as was 
suspected, kept secret what she had seen and endured, a sacrifice to his 
personal resentment. <name type="person">Minucius Thermus</name>, an ex-pr&aelig;tor, he surrendered to 
the hate of <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, because a freedman of <name type="person">Thermus</name> had brought criminal 
charges against <name type="person">Tigellinus</name>, such that the man had to atone for them himself 
by the torture of the rack, his patron by an undeserved death.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p><name type="person">Nero</name> after having butchered so many illustrious 
men, at last aspired to extirpate virtue itself by murdering <name type="person">Thrasea 
P&aelig;tus</name> and <name type="person">Barea Soranus</name>. Both men he had hated of old, <name type="person">Thrasea</name> on 
additional grounds, because he had walked out of the Senate when <name type="person">Agrippina</name>'s 
case was under discussion, as I have already related, and had not given the 
Juvenile games any conspicuous encouragement. <name type="person">Nero</name>'s displeasure at this was 
the deeper, since this same <name type="person">Thrasea</name> had sung in a tragedian's dress at 
<rs type="placename">Patavium</rs>, his birth-place, in some games instituted by the Trojan <name type="person">Antenor</name>. 
On the day, too, on which the pr&aelig;tor <name type="person">Antistius</name> was being sentenced to 
death for libels on <name type="person">Nero</name>, <name type="person">Thrasea</name> proposed and carried a more merciful 
decision. Again, when divine honours were decreed to <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>, he was 
purposely absent and did not attend her funeral. All this <name type="person">Capito Cossutianus</name> 
would not allow to be forgotten. He had a heart eager for the worst 
wickedness, and he also bore ill-will to <name type="person">Thrasea</name>, the weight of whose 
influence had crushed him, while envoys from <rs type="placename">Cilicia</rs> supported by <name type="person">Thrasea</name>'s advocacy, were accusing him of extortion.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>He alleged, too, against him the 
following charges:&mdash;"<name type="person">Thrasea</name>," he said, "at the beginning of the year 
always avoided the usual oath of allegiance; he was not present at the 
recital of the public prayers, though he had been promoted to the priesthood 
of the Fifteen; he had never offered a sacrifice for the safety of the 
prince or for his heavenly voice. Though formerly he had been assiduous and 
unwearied in showing himself a supporter or an opponent even of the most 
ordinary motions of senators, he had not entered the <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs> for three 
years, and very lately, when all were rushing thither with rival eagerness 
to put down <name type="person">Silanus</name> and <name type="person">Vetus</name>, he had attended by preference to the private 
business of his clients. This was political schism, and, should many dare to 
do the like, it was actual war." </p>
<p><name type="person">Capito</name> further added, "The country in 
its eagerness for discord is now talking of you, <name type="person">Nero</name>, and of <name type="person">Thrasea</name>, as it 
talked once of <name type="person">Caius C&aelig;sar</name> and <name type="person">Marcus Cato</name>. <name type="person">Thrasea</name> has his followers 
or rather his satellites, who copy, not indeed as yet the audacious tone of 
his sentiments, but only his manners and his looks, a sour and gloomy set, 
bent on making your mirthfulness a reproach to you. He is the only man who 
cares not for your safety, honours not your accomplishments. The prince's 
prosperity he despises. Can it be that he is not satisfied with your sorrows 
and griefs? It shows the same spirit not to believe in <name type="person">Popp&aelig;a</name>'s 
divinity as to refuse to swear obedience to the acts of the Divine Augustus 
and the Divine <name type="person">Julius</name>. He contemns religious rites; he annuls laws. The 
daily records of the Roman people are read attentively in the provinces and 
the armies that they may know what <name type="person">Thrasea</name> has not done. </p>
<p>"Either let us 
go over to his system, if it is better than ours, or let those who desire 
change have their leader and adviser taken from them. That sect of his gave 
birth to the Tuberones and Favonii, names hateful even to the old republic. 
They make a show of freedom, to overturn the empire; should they destroy it, 
they will attack freedom itself. In vain have you banished <name type="person">Cassius</name>, if you 
are going to allow rivals of the Bruti to multiply and flourish. Finally, 
write nothing yourself about <name type="person">Thrasea</name>; leave the Senate to decide for us." 
<name type="person">Nero</name> further stimulated the eager wrath of <name type="person">Cossutianus</name>,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">THRASEA 
ATTACKED</note>
and associated with him the pungent eloquence of 
<name type="person">Marcellus Eprius</name>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>As for the 
impeachment of <name type="person">Barea Soranus</name>, <name type="person">Ostorius Sabinus</name>, a Roman knight, had already 
claimed it for himself. It arose out of his proconsulate of <rs type="placename">Asia</rs>, where he increased the prince's animosity by his uprightness and diligence, 
as well as by having bestowed pains on opening the port of <rs type="placename">Ephesus</rs> and passed over without punishment the violence of the citizens of <rs type="placename">Pergamos</rs> in their efforts to hinder <name type="person">Acratus</name>, one of the emperor's freedmen, from 
carrying off statues and pictures. But the crime imputed to him was 
friendship with <name type="person">Plautus</name> and intrigues to lure the province into thoughts of 
revolt. The time chosen for the fatal sentence was that at which <name type="person">Tiridates</name> 
was on his way to receive the sovereignty of <rs type="placename">Armenia</rs>, so that crime at home might be partially veiled amid rumours on foreign 
affairs, or that <name type="person">Nero</name> might display his imperial grandeur by the murder of 
illustrious men, as though it were a kingly exploit.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>Accordingly when all <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> 
rushed out to welcome the emperor and see the king, <name type="person">Thrasea</name>, though 
forbidden to appear, did not let his spirit be cast down, but wrote a note 
to <name type="person">Nero</name>, in which he demanded to know the charges against him, and asserted 
that he would clear himself, if he were informed of the crimes alleged and 
had an opportunity of refuting them. This note <name type="person">Nero</name> received with eagerness, 
in the hope that <name type="person">Thrasea</name> in dismay had written something to enhance the 
emperor's glory and to tarnish his own honour. When it turned out otherwise, 
and he himself, on the contrary, dreaded the glance and the defiant 
independence of the guiltless man, he ordered the Senate to be 
summoned.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p><name type="person">Thrasea</name> then consulted his 
most intimate friends whether he should attempt or spurn defence. 
Conflicting advice was offered. Those who thought it best for him to enter 
the <rs type="placename">Senate-house</rs> said that they counted confidently on his courage, and were 
sure that he would say nothing but what would heighten his renown. "It was 
for the feeble and timid to invest their last moments with secrecy. Let the 
people behold a man who could meet death. Let the Senate hear words, almost 
of divine inspiration, more than human. It was possible that the very 
miracle might impress even a <name type="person">Nero</name>.

But should he persist in his 
cruelty, posterity would at least distinguish between the memory of an 
honourable death and the cowardice of those who perished in silence."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>Those, on the other hand, who thought that 
he ought to wait at home, though their opinion of him was the same, hinted 
that mockeries and insults were in store for him. "Spare your ears," they 
said, "taunts and revilings. Not only are <name type="person">Cossutianus</name> and <name type="person">Eprius</name> eagerly 
bent on crime; there are numbers more, daring enough, perchance, to raise 
the hand of violence in their brutality. Even good men through fear do the 
like. Better save the Senate which you have adorned to the last the infamy 
of such an outrage, and leave it a matter of doubt what the senators would 
have decided, had they seen <name type="person">Thrasea</name> on his trial. It is with a vain hope we 
are aiming to touch <name type="person">Nero</name> with shame for his abominations, and we have far 
more cause to fear that he will vent his fury on your wife, your household, 
on all others dear to you. And therefore, while you are yet stainless and 
undisgraced, seek to close life with the glory of those in whose track and 
pursuits you have passed it." </p>
<p>Present at this deliberation was <name type="person">Rusticus 
Arulenus</name>, an enthusiastic youth, who, in his ardour for renown, offered, as 
he was tribune of the people, to protest against the sentence of the Senate. 
<name type="person">Thrasea</name> checked his impetuous temper, not wishing him to attempt what would 
be as futile, and useless to the accused, as it would be fatal to the 
protester. "My days," he said, "are ended, and I must not now abandon a 
scheme of life in which for so many years I have persevered. You are at the 
beginning of a career of office, and your future is yet clear. Weigh 
thoroughly with yourself beforehand, at such a crisis as this, the path of 
political life on which you enter." He then reserved for his own 
consideration the question whether it became him to enter the 
Senate.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>Next day, however, two 
pr&aelig;torian cohorts under arms occupied the temple of <name type="person">Venus Genetrix</name>. A 
group of ordinary citizens with swords which they did not conceal, had 
blocked the approach to the Senate. Through the squares and colonnades were 
scattered bodies of soldiers, amid whose looks of menace the senators 
entered their house. A speech from the emperor was read by his 
qu&aelig;stor. Without addressing any
 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">THRASEA'S DEFENDERS 
AND ACCUSERS</note>
one by name, he censured the senators for neglecting 
their public duties, and drawing by their example the Roman knights into 
idleness. "For what wonder is it," he asked, "that men do not come from 
remote provinces when many, after obtaining the consulate or some sacred 
office, give all their thoughts by choice to the beauty of their gardens?" 
Here was, so to say, a weapon for the accusers, on which they 
fastened.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p><name type="person">Cossutianus</name> made a 
beginning, and then <name type="person">Marcellus</name> in more violent tones exclaimed that the whole 
commonwealth was at stake. "It is," he said, "the stubbornness of inferiors 
which lessens the clemency of our ruler. We senators have hitherto been too 
lenient in allowing him to be mocked with impunity by <name type="person">Thrasea</name> throwing off 
allegiance, by his son-in-law <name type="person">Helvidius Priscus</name> indulging similar frenzies, 
by <name type="person">Paconius Agrippinus</name>, the inheritor of his father's hatred towards 
emperors, and by <name type="person">Curtius Montanus</name>, the habitual composer of abominable 
verses. I miss the presence of an ex-consul in the Senate, of a priest when 
we offer our vows, of a citizen when we swear obedience, unless indeed, in 
defiance of the manners and rites of our ancestors, <name type="person">Thrasea</name> has openly 
assumed the part of a traitor and an enemy. In a word, let the man, wont to 
act the senator and to screen those who disparage the prince, come among us; 
let him propose any reform or change he may desire. We shall more readily 
endure his censure of details than we can now bear the silence by which he 
condemns everything. Is it the peace throughout the world or victories won 
without loss to our armies which vex him? A man who grieves at the country's 
prosperity, who treats our public places, theatres and temples as if they 
were a desert, and who is ever threatening us with exile, let us not enable 
such an one to gratify his perverse vanity. To him the decrees of this 
house, the offices of State, the city of <rs type="placename">Rome</rs> seem 
as nothing. Let him sever his life from a country all love for which he has 
long lost and the very sight of which he has now put from him."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>While <name type="person">Marcellus</name>, with the savage and 
menacing look he usually wore, spoke these and like words with rising fury 
in his voice, countenance, and eye, that familiar grief to which a thick 
succession of perils had habituated the Senate

gave way to a new 
and profounder panic, as they saw the soldiers' hands on their weapons. At 
the same moment the venerable form of <name type="person">Thrasea</name> rose before their imagination, 
and some there were who pitied <name type="person">Helvidius</name> too, doomed as he was to suffer for 
an innocent alliance. "What again," they asked, "was the charge against 
<name type="person">Agrippinus</name> except his father's sad fate, since he too, though guiltless as 
his son, fell beneath the cruelty of <name type="person">Tiberius</name>? As for <name type="person">Montanus</name>, a youth 
without a blemish, author of no libellous poem, he was positively driven out 
an exile because he had exhibited genius."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>And meanwhile <name type="person">Ostorius Sabinus</name>, the accuser of <name type="person">Soranus</name>, entered, 
and began by speaking of his friendship with <name type="person">Rubellius Plautus</name> and of his 
proconsulate in <rs type="placename">Asia</rs> which he had, he said, adapted to his own glory rather than to the public 
welfare, by fostering seditious movements in the various states. These were 
bygones, but there was a fresh charge involving the daughter in the peril of 
the father, to the effect that she had lavished money on astrologers. This 
indeed had really occurred through the filial affection of <name type="person">Servilia</name> (that 
was the girl's name), who, out of love for her father and the 
thoughtlessness of youth, had consulted them, only however about the safety 
of her family, whether <name type="person">Nero</name> could be appeased, and the trial before the 
Senate have no dreadful result. </p>
<p>She was accordingly summoned before the 
Senate, and there they stood facing one another before the consuls' 
tribunal, the aged parent, and opposite to him the daughter, in the 
twentieth year of her age, widowed and forlorn, her husband <name type="person">Annius Pollio</name> 
having lately been driven into banishment, without so much as a glance at 
her father, whose peril she seemed to have aggravated.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>Then on the accuser asking her whether she had sold 
her bridal presents or stript her neck of its ornaments to raise money for 
the performance of magical rites, she at first flung herself on the ground 
and wept long in silence. After awhile, clasping the altar steps and altar, 
she exclaimed, "I have invoked no impious deities, no enchantments, nor 
aught else in my unhappy prayers, but only that thou, <name type="person">C&aelig;sar</name>, and you, 
senators, might preserve unharmed this best of fathers. My jewels, my 
apparel, and the signs of my rank I gave up,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">FATE OF 
THRASEA AND HIS FRIENDS</note>
as I would have given up my life-blood had 
they demanded it. They must have seen this, those men before unknown to me, 
both as to the name they bear and the arts they practise. No mention was 
made by me of the emperor, except as one of the divinities. But my most 
unhappy father knows nothing, and, if it is a crime, I alone am 
guilty."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>While she was yet speaking, 
<name type="person">Soranus</name> caught up her words, and exclaimed that she had not gone with him 
into the province; that, from her youth, she could not have been known to 
<name type="person">Plautus</name>, and that she was not involved in the charges against her husband. 
"Treat separately," he said, "the case of one who is guilty only of an 
exaggerated filial piety, and as for myself, let me undergo any fate." He 
was rushing, as he spoke, into the embraces of his daughter who hurried 
towards him, but the lictors interposed and stopped them both. Place was 
then given to the witnesses, and the appearance among them of <name type="person">Publius 
Egnatius</name> provoked as much indignation as the cruelty of the prosecution had 
excited pity. A client of <name type="person">Soranus</name>, and now hired to ruin his friend, he 
professed the dignified character of a Stoic, and had trained himself in 
demeanour and language to exhibit an ideal of virtue. In his heart, however, 
treacherous and cunning, he concealed greed and sensuality. As soon as money 
had brought these vices to light, he became an example, warning us to beware 
just as much of those who under the guise of virtuous tastes are false and 
deceitful in friendship, as of men wholly entangled in falsehoods and 
stained with every infamy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>That same 
day brought with it a noble pattern in <name type="person">Cassius Asclepiodotus</name>, whose vast 
wealth made him a foremost man in <rs type="placename">Bithynia</rs>. He had honoured <name type="person">Soranus</name> in his prosperity with a respect which he did not 
cast off in his fall, and he was now stript of all his property and driven 
into exile; so impartially indifferent is heaven to examples of virtue and 
vice. <name type="person">Thrasea</name>, <name type="person">Soranus</name>, and <name type="person">Servilia</name> were allowed the choice of death. 
<name type="person">Helvidius</name> and <name type="person">Paconius</name> were banished from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. 
<name type="person">Montanus</name> was spared to his father's intercessions on the understanding that 
he was not to be admitted to political life. The prosecutors, <name type="person">Eprius</name> and 
<name type="person">Cossutianus</name>, received

each five million sesterces, <name type="person">Ostorius</name> 
twelve hundred thousand, with the decorations of the 
qu&aelig;storship.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>Then, as evening 
approached, the consul's qu&aelig;stor was sent to <name type="person">Thrasea</name>, who was passing 
his time in his garden. He had had a crowded gathering of distinguished men 
and women, giving special attention to <name type="person">Demetrius</name>, a professor of the Cynic 
philosophy. With him, as might be inferred from his earnest expression of 
face and from words heard when they raised their voices, he was speculating 
on the nature of the soul and on the separation of the spirit from the body, 
till <name type="person">Domitius C&aelig;cilianus</name>, one of his intimate friends, came to him and 
told him in detail what the Senate had decided. When all who were present, 
wept and bitterly complained, <name type="person">Thrasea</name> urged them to hasten their departure 
and not mingle their own perils with the fate of a doomed man. <name type="person">Arria</name>, too, 
who aspired to follow her husband's end and the example of <name type="person">Arria</name>, her 
mother, he counselled to preserve her life, and not rob the daughter of 
their love of her only stay.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>Then he 
went out into a colonnade, where he was found by the qu&aelig;stor, joyful 
rather than otherwise, as he had learnt that <name type="person">Helvidius</name>, his son-in-law, was 
merely excluded from <rs type="placename">Italy</rs>. When he heard the 
Senate's decision, he led <name type="person">Helvidius</name> and <name type="person">Demetrius</name> into a chamber, and having 
laid bare the arteries of each arm, he let the blood flow freely, and, as he 
sprinkled it on the ground, he called the qu&aelig;stor to his side and 
said, "We pour out a libation to <name type="person">Jupiter</name> the Deliverer. Behold, young man, 
and may the gods avert the omen, but you have been born into times in which 
it is well to fortify the spirit with examples of courage." Then as the 
slowness of his end brought with it grievous anguish, turning his eyes on 
<name type="person">Demetrius</name>. . . . 
<note type="ed" anchored="yes">At this point the Annals are broken off. 
Much remained to be told about the last two years of <name type="person">Nero</name>'s 
reign.</note></p></div2></div1>
