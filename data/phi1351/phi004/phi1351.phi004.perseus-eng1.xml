<head>JANUARY&mdash;MARCH, AD <date value="69">69</date></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>I BEGIN my work with the time when Servius Galba was consul for 
the second time with Titus Vinius for his colleague. Of the former period, 
the 820 years dating from the founding of the city, many authors have 
treated; and while they had to record the transactions of the Roman people, 
they wrote with equal eloquence and freedom. After the conflict at <placeName key="perseus,Actium,Acarnania">Actium</placeName>, and when it became essential to peace, that all 
power should be centered in one man, these great intellects passed away. 
Then too the truthfulness of history was impaired in many ways; at first, 
through men's ignorance of public affairs, which were now wholly strange to 
them, then, through their passion for flattery, or, on the other hand, their 
hatred of their masters. And so between the enmity of the one and the 
servility of the other, neither had any regard for posterity. But while we 
instinctively shrink from a writer's adulation, we lend a ready ear to 
detraction and spite, because flattery involves the shameful imputation of 
servility, whereas malignity wears the false appearance of honesty. I myself 
knew nothing of Galba, of <persName>Otho</persName>, or of Vitellius, either from benefits or 
from injuries. I would not deny that my elevation was begun by Vespasian, 
augmented by Titus, and still further advanced by Domitian; but those who 
profess inviolable truthfulness must speak of all without partiality and 
without hatred. I have reserved as an employment for my old age, should my 
life be long enough, a subject at once more fruitful and less anxious in the 
reign of the Divine Nerva and the empire of Trajan, enjoying the rare 
happiness 
 
of times, when we may think what we please, and express what we think.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>I am entering on the history of a period rich in disasters, frightened in its wars, torn by civil strife, and even in peace full of horrors. Four emperors perished by the sword. There were three civil wars; there were more with foreign 
enemies; there were often wars that had both characters at once. There was 
success in the East, and disaster in the West. There were disturbances in 
 <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>; <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> wavered in 
 its allegiance; <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> was thoroughly subdued and 
immediately abandoned; the tribes of the Suevi and the Sarmat&aelig; rose in 
concert against us; the Dacians had the glory of inflicting as well as 
suffering defeat; the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7016768">Parthia</placeName> were all but 
 set in motion by the cheat of a counterfeit Nero. Now too <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was prostrated by disasters either entirely novel, 
or that recurred only after a long succession of ages; cities in <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>'s 
richest plains were swallowed up and overwhelmed; <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was wasted by conflagrations, its oldest temples 
consumed, and the Capitol itself fired by the hands of citizens. Sacred 
rites were profaned; there was profligacy in the highest ranks; the sea was 
crowded with exiles, and its rocks polluted with bloody deeds. In the 
capital there were yet worse horrors. Nobility, wealth, the refusal or the 
acceptance of office, were grounds for accusation, and virtue ensured 
destruction. The rewards of the informers were no less odious than their 
crimes; for while some seized on consulships and priestly offices, as their 
share of the spoil, others on procuratorships, and posts of more 
confidential authority, they robbed and ruined in every direction amid 
universal hatred and terror. Slaves were bribed to turn against their 
masters, and freedmen to betray their patrons; and those who had not an 
enemy were destroyed by friends.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>Yet 
the age was not so barren in noble qualities, as not also to exhibit 
examples of virtue. Mothers accompanied the flight of their sons; wives 
followed their husbands into exile; there were brave kinsmen and faithful 
sons in law; there were slaves whose fidelity defied even torture; there 
were illustrious men driven to the last necessity, and enduring it with 
fortitude; there were closing scenes that equalled the famous deaths of 
antiquity. Besides the manifold vicissitudes

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS</note>
of human affairs, there 
were prodigies in heaven and earth, the warning voices of the thunder, and 
other intimations of the future, auspicious or gloomy, doubtful or not to be 
mistaken. Never surely did more terrible calamities of the Roman People, or 
evidence more conclusive, prove that the Gods take no thought for our 
happiness, but only for our punishment.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>I think it proper, however, before I commence my purposed work, to pass 
under review the condition of the capital, the temper of the armies, the 
attitude of the provinces, and the elements of weakness and strength which 
existed throughout the whole empire, that so we may become acquainted, not 
only with the vicissitudes and the issues of events, which are often matters 
of chance, but also with their relations and their causes. Welcome as the 
death of <persName>Nero</persName> had been in the first burst of joy, yet it had not only roused 
various emotions in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, among the Senators, the 
people, or the soldiery of the capital, it had also excited all the legions 
and their generals; for now had been divulged that secret of the empire, 
that emperors could be made elsewhere than at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. 
The Senators enjoyed the first exercise of freedom with the less restraint, 
because the Emperor was new to power, and absent from the capital. The 
leading men of the Equestrian order sympathised most closely with the joy of 
the Senators. The respectable portion of the people, which was connected 
with the great families, as well as the dependants and freedmen of condemned 
and banished persons, were high in hope. The degraded populace, frequenters 
of the arena and the theatre, the most worthless of the slaves, and those 
who having wasted their property were supported by the infamous excesses of 
<persName>Nero</persName>, caught eagerly in their dejection at every rumour.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>The soldiery of the capital, who were imbued with the 
spirit of an old allegiance to the C&aelig;sars, and who had been led to 
desert <persName>Nero</persName> by intrigues and influences from without rather than by their 
own feelings, were inclined for change, when they found that the donative 
promised in Galba's name was withheld, and reflected that for great services 
and great rewards there was not the same room in peace as in war, and that 
the favour of an emperor created by the legions must be

already 
preoccupied. They were further excited by the treason of Nymphidius Sabinus, 
their prefect, who himself aimed at the throne. Nymphidius indeed perished 
in the attempt, but, though the head of the mutiny was thus removed, there 
yet remained in many of the soldiers the consciousness of guilt. There were 
even men who talked in angry terms of the feebleness and avarice of Galba. 
The strictness once so commended, and celebrated in the praises of the army, 
was galling to troops who rebelled against the old discipline, and who had 
been accustomed by fourteen years' service under Nero to love the vices of 
their emperors, as much as they had once respected their virtues. To all 
this was added Galba's own expression, "I choose my soldiers, I do not buy 
them," noble words for the commonwealth, but fraught with peril for himself. 
His other acts were not after this pattern.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>Titus Vinius and Cornelius Laco, one the most worthless, the other 
the most spiritless of mankind, were ruining the weak old Emperor, who had 
to bear the odium of such crimes and the scorn felt for such cowardice. 
Galba's progress had been slow and blood-stained. Cingonius Varro, consul 
elect, and Petronius Turpilianus, a man of consular rank, were put to death; 
the former as an accomplice of Nymphidius, the latter as one of Nero's 
generals. Both had perished without hearing or defence, like innocent men. 
His entry into the capital, made after the slaughter of thousands of unarmed 
soldiers, was most ill-omened, and was terrible even to the executioners. As 
he brought into the city his Spanish legion, while that which Nero had 
levied from the fleet still remained, <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was full 
 of strange troops. There were also many detachments from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName>, selected by Nero, and sent on by him to the Caspian passes, for service in the expedition which he 
was preparing against the Albani, but afterwards recalled to crush the 
insurrection of <persName><surname>Vindex</surname></persName>. Here there were vast materials for a revolution, 
without indeed a decided bias towards any one man, but ready to a daring 
hand.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>In this conjuncture it happened 
that tidings of the deaths of Fonteius <persName><surname>Capito</surname></persName> and Clodius Macer reached the 
 capital. Macer was executed in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, where he was 
undoubtedly fomenting sedition, by Trebonius Garutianus the

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">ATTITUDES TOWARDS GALBA</note>
procurator, who acted on Galba's 
authority; Capito fell in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, while he was 
making similar attempts, by the hands of Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius 
Valens, legates of legions, who did not wait for an order. There were 
however some who believed that Capito, though foully stained with avarice 
and profligacy, had yet abstained from all thought of revolution, that this 
was a treacherous accusation invented by the commanders themselves, who had 
urged him to take up arms, when they found themselves unable to prevail, and 
that Galba had approved of the deed, either from weakness of character, or 
to avoid investigation into the circumstances of acts which could not be 
altered. Both executions, however, were unfavourably regarded; indeed, when 
a ruler once becomes unpopular, all his acts, be they good or bad, tell 
against him. The freedmen in their excessive power were now putting up 
everything for sale; the slaves caught with greedy hands at immediate gain, 
and, reflecting on their master's age, hastened to be rich. The new court 
had the same abuses as the old, abuses as grievous as ever, but not so 
readily excused. Even the age of Galba caused ridicule and disgust among 
those whose associations were with the youth of <persName>Nero</persName>, and who were 
accustomed, as is the fashion of the vulgar, to value their emperors by the 
beauty and grace of their persons.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>Such, as far as one can speak of so vast a multitude, was the state of 
 feeling at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Among the provinces, <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> was under the government of Cluvius Rufus, an 
eloquent man, who had all the accomplishments of civil life, but who was 
without experience in war. <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, besides remembering 
<persName>Vindex</persName>, was bound to Galba by the recently conceded privileges of 
citizenship, and by the diminution of its future tribute. Those Gallic 
states, however, which were nearest to the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, had not been treated with the same respect, and 
had even in some cases been deprived of their territory; and these were 
reckoning the gains of others and their own losses with equal indignation. 
The armies of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> were at once alarmed and 
angry, a most dangerous temper when allied with such strength; while elated 
by their recent victory, they feared because they might seem to have 
supported an unsuccessful party. They had been slow to re-

volt 
from <persName>Nero</persName>, and Verginius had not immediately declared for Galba; it was 
doubtful whether he had himself wished to be emperor, but all agreed that 
the empire had been offered to him by the soldiery. Again, the execution of 
<persName>Capito</persName> was a subject of indignation, even with those who could not complain 
of its injustice. They had no leader, for Verginius had been withdrawn on 
the pretext of his friendship with the Emperor. That he was not sent back, 
and that he was even impeached, they regarded as an accusation against 
themselves.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>The army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Upper Germany</placeName> despised their legate, Hordeonius Flaccus, 
who, disabled by age and lameness, had no strength of character and no 
authority; even when the soldiery were quiet, he could not control them, 
much more in their fits of frenzy were they irritated by the very feebleness 
of his restraint. The legions of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Lower Germany</placeName> had 
long been without any general of consular rank, until, by the appointment of 
Galba, Aulus Vitellius took the command. He was son of that Vitellius who 
was censor and three times consul; this was thought sufficient 
recommendation. In the army of <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> there was no 
angry feeling; indeed no troops behaved more blamelessly throughout all the 
troubles of these civil wars, either because they were far away and 
separated by the ocean from the rest of the empire, or because continual 
warfare had taught them to concentrate their hatred on the enemy. <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> too was quiet, though the legions drawn from 
  that province by <persName>Nero</persName> had, while lingering in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, 
sent deputations to Verginius. But separated as these armies were by long 
distances, a thing of all others the most favourable for keeping troops to 
their duty, they could neither communicate their vices, nor combine their 
strength.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>In the East there was as 
 yet no movement. <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and its four legions were 
under the command of Licinius Mucianus, a man whose good and bad fortune 
were equally famous. In his youth he had cultivated with many intrigues the 
friendship of the great. His resources soon failed, and his position became 
precarious, and as he also suspected that Claudius had taken some offence, 
he withdrew into a retired part of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and was as 
like an exile, as he was aft-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">POSITION OF 
MUCIANUS AND VESPASIAN</note>
erwards like an emperor. He was a compound of 
dissipation and energy, of arrogance and courtesy, of good and bad 
qualities. His self-indulgence was excessive, when he had leisure, yet 
whenever he had served, he had shown great qualities. In his public capacity 
he might be praised; his private life was in bad repute. Yet over subjects, 
friends, and colleagues, he exercised the influence of many fascinations. He 
was a man who would find it easier to transfer the imperial power to 
another, than to hold it for himself. Flavius Vespasian, a general of <persName>Nero</persName>'s 
 appointment, was carrying on the war in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> 
with three legions, and he had no wish or feeling adverse to Galba. He had 
in fact sent his son Titus to acknowledge his authority and bespeak his 
favour, as in its proper place I shall relate. As for the hidden decrees of 
fate, the omens and the oracles that marked out Vespasian and his sons for 
imperial power, we believed in them only after his success.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>Ever since the time of the Divine Augustus Roman 
 Knights have ruled <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> as kings, and the forces by 
which it has to be kept in subjection. It has been thought expedient thus to 
keep under home control a province so difficult of access, so productive of 
corn, ever distracted, excitable, and restless through the superstition and 
licentiousness of its inhabitants, knowing nothing of laws, and unused to 
civil rule. Its governor was at this time Tiberius Alexander, a native of 
the country. <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> and its legions, now that 
Clodius Macer was dead, were disposed to be content with any emperor, after 
having experienced the rule of a smaller tyrant. The two divisions of <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName>, <placeName>Noricum</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> and the other 
provinces governed by procurators, as they were near this or that army, were 
driven by the presence of such powerful neighbours into friendship or 
hostility. The unarmed provinces with <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> at their 
head were exposed to any kind of slavery, and were ready to become the prize 
of victory. Such was the state of the Roman world, when Servius Galba, 
consul for the second time, with T. Vinius for his colleague, entered upon a 
year, which was to be the last of their lives, and which well nigh brought 
the commonwealth to an end.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>A few 
days after the 1st of January, there arrived

from <placeName>Belgica</placeName> despatches of Pompeius Propinquus, the 
Procurator, to this effect; that the legions of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Upper 
Germany</placeName> had broken through the obligation of their military oath, and 
were demanding another emperor, but conceded the power of choice to the 
Senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in the hope that a more 
lenient view might be taken of their revolt. These tidings hastened the 
plans of Galba, who had been long debating the subject of adoption with 
himself and with his intimate friends. There was indeed no more frequent 
subject of conversation during these months, at first because men had 
liberty and inclination to talk of such matters, afterwards because the 
feebleness of Galba was notorious. Few had any discrimination or patriotism, 
many had foolish hopes for themselves, and spread interested reports, in 
which they named this or that person to whom they might be related as friend 
or dependant. They were also moved by hatred of T. Vinius, who grew daily 
more powerful, and in the same proportion more unpopular. The very easiness 
of Galba's temper stimulated the greedy cupidity which great advancement had 
excited in his friends, because with one so weak and so credulous wrong 
might be done with less risk and greater gain.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>The real power of the Empire was divided between T. Vinius, the 
consul, and Cornelius Laco, prefect of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard. Icelus, a 
freedman of Galba, was in equal favour; he had been presented with the rings 
of knighthood, and bore the Equestrian name of Martianus. These men, being 
at variance, and in smaller matters pursuing their own aims, were divided in 
the affair of choosing a successor, into two opposing factions. T. Vinius 
was for Marcus Otho, Laco and Icelus agreed, not indeed in supporting any 
particular individual, but in striving for some one else. Galba indeed was 
aware of the friendship between Vinius and Otho; the gossip of those who 
allow nothing to pass in silence had named them as father-in-law and 
son-in-law, for Vinius had a widowed daughter, and Otho was unmarried. I 
believe that he had also at heart some care for the commonwealth, in vain, 
he would think, rescued from <persName>Nero</persName>, if it was to be left with Otho. For 
Otho's had been a neglected boyhood and a riotous youth, and he had made 
himself agreeable to

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">MUTINY IN <placeName key="7000084">GERMANY</placeName>; OTHO'S CANDIDACY</note>
Nero by emulating his 
profligacy. For this reason the Emperor had entrusted to him, as being the 
confidant of his amours, Popp&aelig;a Sabina, the imperial favourite, until 
he could rid himself of his wife <persName>Octavia</persName>. Soon suspecting him with regard to 
 this same Popp&aelig;a, he sent him out of the way to the province of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Lusitania</placeName>, ostensibly to be its governor. <persName>Otho</persName> ruled the 
province with mildness, and, as he was the first to join Galba's party, was 
not without energy, and, while the war lasted, was the most conspicuous of 
the Emperor's followers, he was led to cherish more and more passionately 
every day those hopes of adoption which he had entertained from the first. 
Many of the soldiers favoured him, and the court was biassed in his favour, 
because he resembled <persName>Nero</persName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>When Galba 
heard of the mutiny in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, though nothing was 
as yet known about Vitellius, he felt anxious as to the direction which the 
violence of the legions might take, while he could not trust even the 
soldiery of the capital. He therefore resorted to what he supposed to be the 
only remedy, and held a council for the election of an emperor. To this he 
summoned, besides Vinius and <persName>Laco</persName>, Marius Celsus, consul elect, and 
Ducennius Geminus, prefect of the city. Having first said a few words about 
his advanced years, he ordered Piso Licinianus to be summoned. It is 
uncertain whether he acted on his own free choice, or, as believed by some, 
under the influence of <persName>Laco</persName>, who through Rubellius Plautus had cultivated 
the friendship of <persName>Piso</persName>. But, cunningly enough, it was as a stranger that 
Laco supported him, and the high character of <persName>Piso</persName> gave weight to his 
advice. Piso, who was the son of M. Crassus and Scribonia, and thus of noble 
descent on both sides, was in look and manner a man of the old type. Rightly 
judged, he seemed a stern man, morose to those who estimated him less 
favourably. This point in his character pleased his adopted father in 
proportion as it raised the anxious suspicions of others.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>We are told that Galba, taking hold of Piso's hand, 
spoke to this effect: "If I were a private man, and were now adopting you by 
the Act of the Curi&aelig; before the Pontiffs, as our custom is, it would 
be a high honour to me to intro-

duce into my family a descendant 
of Cn. Pompeius and M. Crassus; it would be a distinction to you to add to 
the nobility of your race the honours of the Sulpician and Lutatian houses. 
As it is, I, who have been called to the throne by the unanimous consent of 
gods and men, am moved by your splendid endowments and by my own patriotism 
to offer to you, a man of peace, that power, for which our ancestors fought, 
and which I myself obtained by war. I am following the precedent of the 
Divine Augustus, who placed on an eminence next to his own, first his nephew 
<persName>Marcellus</persName>, then his son-in-law Agrippa, afterwards his grandsons, and 
finally <persName>Tiberius</persName> <persName>Nero</persName>, his step-son. But Augustus looked for a successor in 
his own family, I look for one in the state, not because I have no relatives 
or companions of my campaigns, but because it was not by any private favour 
that I myself received the imperial power. Let the principle of my choice be 
shewn not only by my connections which I have set aside for you, but by your 
own. You have a brother, noble as yourself, and older, who would be well 
worthy of this dignity, were you not worthier. Your age is such as to be now 
free from the passions of youth, and such your life that in the past you 
have nothing to excuse. Hitherto, you have only borne adversity; prosperity 
tries the heart with keener temptations; for hardships may be endured, 
whereas we are spoiled by success. You indeed will cling with the same 
constancy to honour, freedom, friendship, the best possessions of the human 
spirit, but others will seek to weaken them with their servility. You will 
be fiercely assailed by adulation, by flattery, that worst poison of the 
true heart and by the selfish interests of individuals. You and I speak 
together to-day with perfect frankness, but others will be more ready to 
address us as emperors than as men. For to urge his duty upon a prince is 
indeed a hard matter; to flatter him, whatever his character, is a mere 
routine gone through without any heart.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>"Could the vast frame of this empire have stood and preserved 
its balance without a directing spirit, I was not unworthy of inaugurating a 
republic. As it is, we have been long reduced to a position, in which my age 
can confer no greater boon on the Roman people than a good successor,

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">GALBA ADOPTS PISO</note>
your youth no greater than a 
good emperor. Under Tiberius, Caius, and Claudius, we were, so to speak, the 
inheritance of a single family. The choice which begins with us will be a 
substitute for freedom. Now that the family of the Julii and the Claudii has 
come to an end, adoption will discover the worthiest successor. To be 
begotten and born of a princely race is a mere accident, and is only valued 
as such. In adoption there is nothing that need bias the judgment, and if 
you wish to make a choice, an unanimous opinion points out the man. Let Nero 
be ever before your eyes, swollen with the pride of a long line of 
C&aelig;sars; it was not <persName>Vindex</persName> with his unarmed province, it was not myself 
with my single legion, that shook his yoke from our necks. It was his own 
profligacy, his own brutality, and that, though there had been before no 
precedent of an emperor condemned by his own people. We, who have been 
called to power by the issues of war, and by the deliberate judgment of 
others, shall incur unpopularity, however illustrious our character. Do not 
however be alarmed, if, after a movement which has shaken the world, two 
legions are not yet quiet. I did not myself succeed to a throne without 
anxiety; and when men shall hear of your adoption I shall no longer be 
thought old, and this is the only objection which is now made against me. 
<persName>Nero</persName> will always be regretted by the thoroughly depraved; it is for you and 
me to take care, that he be not regretted also by the good. To prolong such 
advice, suits not this occasion, and all my purpose is fulfilled if I have 
made a good choice in you. The most practical and the shortest method of 
distinguishing between good and bad measures, is to think what you yourself 
would or would not like under another emperor. It is not here, as it is 
among nations despotically ruled, that there is a distinct governing family, 
while all the rest are slaves. You have to reign over men who cannot bear 
either absolute slavery or absolute freedom." This, with more to the same 
effect, was said by Galba; he spoke to <persName>Piso</persName> as if he were creating an 
emperor; the others addressed him as if he were an emperor already.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>It is said of <persName>Piso</persName> that he betrayed no 
discomposure or excessive joy, either to the gaze to which he was 
immediately subjected, or afterwards when all eyes were turned

upon him. His language to the Emperor, his father, was reverential; 
his language about himself was modest. He shewed no change in look or 
manner; he seemed like one who had the power rather than the wish to rule. 
It was next discussed whether the adoption should be publicly pronounced in 
front of the Rostra, in the Senate, or in the camp. It was thought best to 
go to the camp. This would be a compliment to the soldiery, and their 
favour, base as it was to purchase it by bribery or intrigue, was not to be 
despised if it could be obtained by honourable means. Meanwhile the 
expectant people had surrounded the palace, impatient to learn the great 
secret, and those who sought to stifle the ill-concealed rumour did but 
spread it the more.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>The 10th of 
January was a gloomy, stormy day, unusually disturbed by thunder, lightning, 
and all bad omens from heaven. Though this had from ancient time been made a 
reason for dissolving an assembly, it did not deter Galba from proceeding to 
the camp; either because he despised such things as being mere matters of 
chance, or because the decrees of fate, though they be foreshewn, are not 
escaped. Addressing a crowded assembly of the soldiers he announced, with 
imperial brevity, that he adopted <persName>Piso</persName>, following the precedent of the 
Divine Augustus, and the military custom by which a soldier chooses his 
comrade. Fearing that to conceal the mutiny would be to make them think it 
greater than it really was, he spontaneously declared that the 4th and 18th 
legions, led by a few factious persons, had been insubordinate, but had not 
gone beyond certain words and cries, and that they would soon return to 
their duty. To this speech he added no word of flattery, no hint of a bribe. 
Yet the tribunes, the centurions, and such of the soldiers as stood near, 
made an encouraging response. A gloomy silence prevailed among the rest, who 
seemed to think that they had lost by war that right to a donative which 
they had made good even in peace. It is certain that their feelings might 
have been conciliated by the very smallest liberality on the part of the 
parsimonious old man. He was ruined by his old-fashioned inflexibility, and 
by an excessive sternness which we are no longer able to endure.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>Then followed Galba's speech in the Senate, 
which

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">ADOPTION PROCLAIMED; FINANCES</note>
was as plain and brief as his speech to the soldiery. <persName>Piso</persName> delivered a gracefuloration and was supported by the feeling of the Senate. Many who wished him 
well, spoke with enthusiasm; those who had opposed him, in moderate terms; 
the majority met him with an officious homage, having aims of their own and 
no thought for the state. <persName>Piso</persName> neither said nor did anything else in public 
in the following four days which intervened between his adoption and his 
death. As tidings of the mutiny in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> were 
arriving with daily increasing frequency, while the country was ready to 
receive and to credit all intelligence that had an unfavourable character, 
the Senate came to a resolution to send deputies to the German armies. It 
was privately discussed whether <persName>Piso</persName> should go with them to give them a more 
imposing appearance; they, it was said, would bring with them the authority 
of the Senate, he the majesty of the C&aelig;sar. It was thought expedient 
to send with them Cornelius Laco, prefect of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard, but 
he thwarted the design. In nominating, excusing, and changing the deputies, 
the Senate having entrusted the selection to Galba, the Emperor shewed a 
disgraceful want of firmness, yielding to individuals, who made interest to 
stay or to go, as their fears or their hopes prompted.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>Next came the question of money. On a general 
inquiry it seemed the fairest course to demand restitution from those who 
had caused the public poverty. <persName>Nero</persName> had squandered in presents two thousand 
two hundred million sesterces. It was ordered that each recipient should be 
sued, but should be permitted to retain a tenth part of the bounty. They had 
however barely a tenth part left, having wasted the property of others in 
the same extravagances in which they had squandered their own, till the most 
rapacious and profligate among them had neither capital nor land remaining, 
nothing in fact but the appliances of their vices. Thirty Roman Knights were 
appointed to conduct the process of recovery, a novel office, and made 
burdensome by the number and intriguing practices of those with whom it had 
to deal. Everywhere were sales and brokers, and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> 
was in an uproar with auctions. Yet great was the joy to think that the men 
whom <persName>Nero</persName> had enriched would be as poor as those

whom he had 
robbed. About this time were cashiered two tribunes of the Pr&aelig;torian 
Guard, Antonius Taurus and Antonius Naso, an officer of the City cohorts, 
&AElig;milius Pacensis, and one of the watch, Julius Fronto. This led to no 
amendment with the rest, but only started the apprehension, that a crafty 
and timid policy was getting rid of individuals, while all were 
suspected.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p><persName>Otho</persName>, meanwhile, who had 
nothing to hope while the State was tranquil, and whose whole plans depended 
on revolution, was being roused to action by a combination of many motives, 
by a luxury that would have embarrassed even an emperor, by a poverty that a 
subject could hardly endure, by his rage against Galba, by his envy of <persName>Piso</persName>. 
He even pretended to fear to make himself keener in desire. "I was," said 
he, "too formidable to <persName>Nero</persName>, and I must not look for another <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Lusitania</placeName>, another honourable exile. Rulers always 
suspect and hate the man who has been named for the succession. This has 
injured me with the aged Emperor, and will injure me yet more with a young 
man whose temper, naturally savage, has been rendered ferocious by prolonged 
exile. How easy to put <persName>Otho</persName> to death! I must therefore do and dare now while 
Galba's authority is still unsettled, and before that of <persName>Piso</persName> is 
consolidated. Periods of transition suit great attempts, and delay is 
useless where inaction is more hurtful than temerity. Death, which nature 
ordains for all alike, yet admits of the distinction of being either 
forgotten, or remembered with honour by posterity; and, if the same lot 
awaits the innocent and the guilty, the man of spirit will at least deserve 
his fate."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>The soul of <persName>Otho</persName> was not 
effeminate like his person. His confidential freedmen and slaves, who 
enjoyed a license unknown in private families, brought the debaucheries of 
<persName>Nero</persName>'s court, its intrigues, its easy marriages, and the other indulgences 
of despotic power, before a mind passionately fond of such things, dwelt 
upon them as his if he dared to seize them, and reproached the inaction that 
would leave them to others. The astrologers also urged him to action, 
predicting from their observation of the heavens revolutions, and a year of 
glory for <persName>Otho</persName>. This is a class of men, whom the powerful cannot trust, and 
who deceive the aspiring, a

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHO'S 
INTRIGUES</note>
class which will always be proscribed in this country, and 
yet always retained. Many of these men were attached to the secret councils 
of Popp&aelig;a and were the vilest tools in the employ of the imperial 
household. One of them, Ptolem&aelig;us, had attended <persName>Otho</persName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and had there foretold that his patron would 
survive <persName>Nero</persName>. Gaining credit by the result, and arguing from his own 
conjectures and from the common talk of those who compared Galba's age with 
<persName>Otho</persName>'s youth, he had persuaded the latter that he would be called to the 
throne. <persName>Otho</persName> however received the prediction as the words of wisdom and the 
intimation of destiny, with that inclination so natural to the human mind 
readily to believe in the mysterious.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>Nor did Ptolem&aelig;us fail to play his part; he now even prompted to 
crime, to which from such wishes it is easy to pass. Whether indeed these 
thoughts of crime were suddenly conceived, is doubtful. Otho had long been 
courting the affections of the soldiery, either in the hope of succeeding to 
the throne, or in preparation for some desperate act. On the march, on 
parade, and in their quarters, he would address all the oldest soldiers by 
name, and in allusion to the progresses of <persName>Nero</persName> would call them his 
messmates. Some he would recognise, he would inquire after others, and would 
help them with his money and interest. He would often intersperse his 
conversation with complaints and insinuations against Galba and anything 
else that might excite the vulgar mind. Laborious marches, a scanty 
commissariat, and the rigour of military discipline, were especially 
distasteful, when men, accustomed to sail to the lakes of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName> and the cities of <placeName key="1000074">Greece</placeName>, had painfully to struggle under the weight of 
 their arms over the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName>, the Alps, and vast distances of road.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>The minds of the soldiery were already on fire, 
when M&aelig;vius Pudens, a near relative of Tigellinus, added, so to speak, 
fuel to the flames. In his endeavour to win over all who were particularly 
weak in character, or who wanted money and were ready to plunge into 
revolution, he gradually went so far as to distribute, whenever Galba dined 
with <persName>Otho</persName>, one hundred sesterces to each soldier of the cohort on duty, 
under pretext of treating them. This, which
 
we may almost call a 
public bounty, <persName>Otho</persName> followed up by presents more privately bestowed on 
individuals; nay he bribed with such spirit, that, finding there was a 
dispute between Cocceius Proculus, a soldier of the bodyguard, and one of 
his neighbours, about some part of their boundaries, he purchased with his 
own money the neighbour's entire estate, and made a present of it to the 
soldier. He took advantage of the lazy indifference of the Prefect, who over 
looked alike notorious facts and secret practices.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>He then entrusted the conduct of his meditated 
treason to Onomastus, one of his freedmen, who brought over to his views 
Barbius Proculus, officer of the watchword to the bodyguard, and Veturius, a 
deputy centurion in the same force. Having assured himself by various 
conversations with these men that they were cunning and bold, he loaded them 
with presents and promises, and furnished them with money with which to 
tempt the cupidity of others. Thus two soldiers from the ranks undertook to 
transfer the Empire of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and actually 
transferred it. Only a few were admitted to be accomplices in the plot, but 
they worked by various devices on the wavering minds of the remainder; on 
the more distinguished soldiers, by hinting that the favours of Nymphidius 
had subjected them to suspicion; on the vulgar herd, by the anger and 
despair with which the repeated postponement of the donative had inspired 
them. Some were fired by their recollections of <persName>Nero</persName> and their longing 
regrets for their old license. All felt a common alarm at the idea of having 
to serve elsewhere.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>The contagion 
spread to the legions and the auxiliary troops, already excited by the news 
of the wavering loyalty of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. So 
ripe were the disaffected for mutiny and so close the secresy preserved by 
the loyal, that they would actually have seized <persName>Otho</persName> on the 14th of January, 
as he was returning from dinner, had they not been deterred by the risks of 
darkness, the inconvenient dispersion of the troops over the whole city, and 
the difficulty of concerted action among a half-intoxicated crowd. It was no 
care for the state, which they deliberately meditated polluting with the 
blood of their Emperor; it was a fear lest in the darkness of night any one 
who presented himself to the

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DISAFFECTION OF 
SOLDIERY</note>
soldiers of the Pannonian or German army might be fixed on 
instead of Otho, whom few of them knew. Many symptoms of the approaching 
outburst were repressed by those who were in the secret. Some hints, which 
had reached Galba's ears, were turned into ridicule by <persName>Laco</persName> the prefect, who 
knew nothing of the temper of the soldiery, and who, inimical to all 
measures, however excellent, which he did not originate, obstinately 
thwarted men wiser than himself.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>On 
the 15th of January, as Galba was sacrificing in front of the temple of 
Apollo, the Haruspex Umbricius announced to him that the entrails had a 
sinister aspect, that treachery threatened him, that he had an enemy at 
home. <persName>Otho</persName> heard, for he had taken his place close by, and interpreted it by 
contraries in a favourable sense, as promising success to his designs. Not 
long after his freedman Onomastus informed him that the architect and the 
contractors were waiting for him. It had been arranged thus to indicate that 
the soldiers were assembling, and that the preparations of the conspiracy 
were complete. To those who inquired the reason of his departure, <persName>Otho</persName> 
pretended that he was purchasing certain farm-buildings, which from their 
age he suspected to be unsound, and which had therefore to be first 
surveyed. Leaning on his freedman's arm, he proceeded through the palace of 
<persName>Tiberius</persName> to the Velabrum, and thence to the golden 
milestone near the temple of <persName>Saturn</persName>. There three and twenty soldiers of the 
body-guard saluted him as Emperor, and, while he trembled at their scanty 
number, put him hastily into a chair, drew their swords, and hurried him 
onwards. About as many more soldiers joined them on their way, some because 
they were in the plot, many from mere surprise; some shouted and brandished 
their swords, others proceeded in silence, intending to let the issue 
determine their sentiments.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>Julius 
Martialis was the tribune on guard in the camp. Appalled by the enormity and 
suddenness of the crime, or perhaps fearing that the troops were very 
extensively corrupted and that it would be destruction to oppose them, he 
made many suspect him of complicity. The rest of the tribunes and centurions 
preferred immediate safety to danger and duty. Such was the temper of men's 
minds, that,

while there were few to venture on so atrocious a 
treason, many wished it done, and all were ready to acquiesce.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>Meanwhile the unconscious Galba, busy with his 
sacrifice, was importuning the gods of an empire that was now another's. A 
rumour reached him, that some senator unknown was being hurried into the 
camp; before long it was affirmed that this senator was <persName>Otho</persName>. At the same 
time came messengers from all parts of the city, where they had chanced to 
meet the procession, some exaggerating the danger, some, who could not even 
then forget to flatter, representing it as less than the reality. On 
deliberation it was determined to sound the feeling of the cohort on guard 
in the palace, but not through Galba in person, whose authority was to be 
kept unimpaired to meet greater emergencies. They were accordingly collected 
before the steps of the palace, and <persName>Piso</persName> addressed them as 
follows:&mdash;"Comrades, this is the sixth day since I became a C&aelig;sar 
by adoption, not knowing what was to happen, whether this title was to be 
desired, or dreaded. It rests with you to determine what will be the result 
to my family and to the state. It is not that I dread on my own account the 
gloomier issue; for I have known adversity, and I am learning at this very 
moment that prosperity is fully as dangerous. It is the lot of my father, of 
the Senate, of the Empire itself, that I deplore, if we have either to fall 
this day, or to do what is equally abhorrent to the good, to put others to 
death. In the late troubles we had this consolation, a capital unstained by 
bloodshed, and power transferred without strife. It was thought that by my 
adoption provision was made against the possibility of war, even after 
Galba's death.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>"I will lay no claim 
to nobleness, or moderation, for indeed, to count up virtues in comparing 
oneself with <persName>Otho</persName> is needless. The vices, of which alone he boasts, 
overthrew the Empire, even when he was but the Emperor's friend. Shall he 
earn that Empire now by his manner and his gait, or by those womanish 
adornments? They are deceived, on whom luxury imposes by its false show of 
liberality; he will know how to squander, he will not know how to give. 
Already he is thinking of debaucheries, of revels, of tribes of mistresses. 
These things he holds to be the prizes of princely

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">TROOPS FAVOR OTHO</note>
power, things, in which the wanton 
enjoyment will be for him alone, the shame and the disgrace for all. Never 
yet has any one exercised for good ends the power obtained by crime. The 
unanimous will of mankind gave to Galba the title of C&aelig;sar, and you 
consented when he gave it to me. Were the Senate, the Country, the People, 
but empty names, yet, comrades, it is your interest that the most worthless 
of men should not create an Emperor. We have occasionally heard of legions 
mutinying against their generals, but your loyalty, your character, stand 
unimpeached up to this time. Even with <persName>Nero</persName>, it was he that deserted you, 
not you that deserted him. Shall less than thirty runaways and deserters 
whom no one would allow to choose a tribune or centurion for themselves, 
assign the Empire at their pleasure? Do you tolerate the precedent? Do you 
by your inaction make the crime your own? This lawless spirit will pass into 
the provinces, and though we shall suffer from this treason, you will suffer 
from the wars that will follow. Again, no more is offered you for murdering 
your Prince, than you will have if you shun such guilt. We shall give you a 
donative for your loyalty, as surely as others can give it for your 
treason."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>The soldiers of the 
body-guard dispersed, but the rest of the cohort, who shewed no disrespect 
to the speaker, displayed their standards, acting, as often happens in a 
disturbance, on mere impulse and without any settled plan, rather than, as 
was afterwards believed, with treachery and an intention to deceive. Celsus 
Marius was sent to the picked troops from the army of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, then encamped in the Portico of Vipsanius. 
Instructions were also given to Amulius Serenus and Quintius Sabinus, 
centurions of the first rank, to bring up the German soldiers from the Hall 
of Liberty. No confidence was placed in the legion levied from the fleet, 
which had been enraged by the massacre of their comrades, whom Galba had 
slaughtered immediately on his entry into the capital. Meanwhile Cetrius 
Severus, Subrius Dexter, and Pompeius Longinus, all three military tribunes, 
proceeded to the Pr&aelig;torian camp, in the hope that a sedition, which 
was but just commencing, and not yet fully matured, might be swayed by 
better counsels. Two of these tribunes, Subrius and Cetrius, the soldiers 
assailed with men-

aces; Longinus they seized and disarmed; it 
was not his rank as an officer, but his friendship with Galba, that bound 
him to that Prince, and roused a stronger suspicion in the mutineers. The 
legion levied from the fleet joined the Pr&aelig;torians without any 
hesitation. The Illyrian detachments drove Celsus away with a shower of 
javelins. The German veterans wavered long. Their frames were still 
enfeebled by sickness, and their minds were favourably disposed towards 
Galba, who, finding them exhausted by their long return voyage from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, whither they had been sent on by <persName>Nero</persName>, had 
supplied their wants with a most unsparing attention.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>The whole populace and the slaves with them were 
now crowding the palace, clamouring with discordant shouts for the death of 
<persName>Otho</persName> and the destruction of the conspirators, just as if they were demanding 
some spectacle in the circus or amphitheatre. They had not indeed any 
discrimination or sincerity, for on that same day they would raise with 
equal zeal a wholly different cry. It was their traditional custom to 
flatter any ruler with reckless applause and meaningless zeal. Meanwhile two 
suggestions were keeping Galba in doubt. T. Vinius thought that he should 
remain within the palace, array the slaves against the foe, secure the 
approaches, and not go out to the enraged soldiers. "You should," he said, 
"give the disaffected time to repent, the loyal time to unite. Crimes gain 
by hasty action, better counsels by delay. At all events, you will still 
have the same facilities of going out, if need be, whereas, your retreat, 
should you repent of having gone, will be in the power of another."</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>The rest were for speedy action, "before," 
they said, "the yet feeble treason of this handful of men can gather 
strength. <persName>Otho</persName> himself will be alarmed, <persName>Otho</persName>, who stole away to be 
introduced to a few strangers, but who now, thanks to the hesitation and 
inaction in which we waste our time, is learning how to play the Prince. We 
must not wait till, having arranged matters in the camp, he bursts into the 
Forum, and under Galba's very eyes makes his way to the Capitol, while our 
noble Emperor with his brave friends barricades the doors of his palace. We 
are to stand a siege

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">GALBA'S 
FECKLESSNESS</note>
forsooth, and truly we shall have an admirable resource 
in the slaves, if the unanimous feeling of this vast multitude, and that 
which can do so much, the first burst of indignation, be suffered to 
subside. Moreover that cannot be safe which is not honourable. If we must 
fall, let us go to meet the danger. This will bring more odium upon Otho, 
and will be more becoming to ourselves." Vinius opposing this advice, <persName>Laco</persName> 
assailed him with threats, encouraged by Icelus, who persisted in his 
private animosities to the public ruin.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>Without further delay Galba sided with these more plausible 
advisers. <persName>Piso</persName> was sent on into the camp, as being a young man of noble 
name, whose popularity was of recent date, and who was a bitter enemy to T. 
Vinius, that is, either he was so in reality, or these angry partisans would 
have it so, and belief in hatred is but too ready. <persName>Piso</persName> had hardly gone 
forth when there came a rumour, at first vague and wanting confirmation, 
that <persName>Otho</persName> had been slain in the camp; soon, as happens with these great 
fictions, men asserted that they had been present, and had seen the deed: 
and, between the delight of some and the indifference of others, the report 
was easily believed. Many thought the rumour had been invented and 
circulated by the Othonianists, who were now mingling with the crowd, and 
who disseminated these false tidings of success to draw Galba out of the 
palace.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>Upon this not only did the 
people and the ignorant rabble break out into applause and vehement 
expressions of zeal, but many of the Knights and Senators, losing their 
caution as they laid aside their fear, burst open the doors of the palace, 
rushed in, and displayed themselves to Galba, complaining that their revenge 
had been snatched from them. The most arrant coward, the man, who, as the 
event proved, would dare nothing in the moment of danger, was the most 
voluble and fierce of speech. No one knew anything, yet all were confident 
in assertion, till at length Galba in the dearth of all true intelligence, 
and overborne by the universal delusion, assumed his cuirass, and as, from 
age and bodily weakness, he could not stand up against the crowd that was 
still rushing in, he was elevated on a chair. He was met in the palace by 
Julius Atticus, a soldier of the

body-guard, who, displaying a 
bloody sword, cried "I have slain <persName>Otho</persName>." "Comrade," replied Galba, "who gave 
the order? So singularly resolute was his spirit in curbing the license of 
the soldiery; threats did not dismay him, nor flatteries seduce.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>There was now no doubt about the feeling of 
all the troops in the camp. So great was their zeal, that, not content with 
surrounding <persName>Otho</persName> with their persons in close array, they elevated him to the 
pedestal, on which a short time before had stood the gilt statue of Galba, 
and there, amid the standards, encircled him with their colours. Neither 
tribunes nor centurions could approach. The common soldiers even insisted 
that all the officers should be watched. Everything was in an uproar with 
their tumultuous cries and their appeals to each other, which were not, like 
those of a popular assembly or a mob, the discordant expressions of an idle 
flattery; on the contrary, as soon as they caught sight of any of the 
soldiers who were flocking in, they seized him gave him the military 
embrace, placed him close to <persName>Otho</persName>, dictated to him the oath of allegiance, 
commending sometimes the Emperor to his soldiers, sometimes the soldiers to 
their Emperor. <persName>Otho</persName> did not fail to play his part; he stretched out his 
arms, and bowed to the crowd, and kissed his hands, and altogether acted the 
slave, to make himself the master. It was when the whole legion from the 
fleet had taken the oath to him, that feeling confidence in his strength, 
and thinking that the men, on whose individual feeling he had been working, 
should be roused by a general appeal, he stood before the rampart of the 
camp, and spoke as follows:</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>"Comrades, I cannot say in what character I have presented myself to you; I 
refuse to call myself a subject, now that you have named me Prince, or 
Prince, while another reigns. Your title also will be equally uncertain, so 
long as it shall be a question, whether it is the Emperor of the Roman 
people, or a public enemy, whom you have in your camp. Mark you, how in one 
breath they cry for my punishment and for your execution. So evident it is, 
that we can neither perish, nor be saved, except together. Perhaps, with his 
usual clemency, Galba has already promised that

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHO'S POPULARITY</note>
we should die, like the man, who, though 
no one demanded it, massacred so many thousands of perfectly guiltless 
soldiers. A shudder comes over my soul, whenever I call to mind that ghastly 
entry, Galba's solitary victory, when, before the eyes of the capital he 
gave orders to decimate the prisoners, the suppliants, whom he had admitted 
to surrender. These were the auspices with which he entered the city. What 
is the glory that he has brought to the throne? None but that he has 
murdered Obultronius Sabinus and Cornelius Marcellus in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, Betuus Chilo in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Gaul</placeName>, 
 Fonteius Capito in <placeName key="7000084">Germany</placeName>, Clodius Macer in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, Cingonius on the high road, Turpilianus in the 
city, Nymphidius in the camp. What province, what camp in the world, but is 
stained with blood and foul with crime, or, as he expresses it himself, 
purified and chastened? For what others call crimes he calls reforms, and, 
by similar misnomers, he speaks of strictness instead of barbarity, of 
economy instead of avarice, while the cruelties and affronts inflicted upon 
you he calls discipline. Seven months only have passed since <persName>Nero</persName> fell, and 
already Icelus has seized more than the Polycleti, the Vatinii, and the Elii 
amassed. Vinius would not have gone so far with his rapacity and lawlessness 
had he been Emperor himself; as it is, he has lorded it over us as if we had 
been his own subjects, has held us as cheap as if we had been another's. 
That one house would furnish the donative, which is never given you, but 
with which you are daily upbraided.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>"Again, that we might have nothing to hope even from his successor, Galba 
fetches out of exile the man in whose ill-humour and avarice he considers 
that he has found the best resemblance to himself. You witnessed, comrades, 
how by a remarkable storm even the Gods discountenanced that ill-starred 
adoption; and the feeling of the Senate, of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, is the same. It is to your valour that they look, 
in you these better counsels find all their support, without you, noble as 
they may be, they are powerless. It is not to war or to danger that I invite 
you; the swords of all Roman soldiers are with us. At this moment Galba has 
but one half-armed cohort, which is detaining, not defending him. Let it 
once behold you, let it receive my sig-

nal, and the only strife 
will be, who shall oblige me most. There is no room for delay in a business 
which can only be approved when it is done." He then ordered the armoury to 
be opened. The soldiers immediately seized the arms without regard to rule 
or military order, no distinction being observed between Pr&aelig;torians 
and legionaries, both of whom again indiscriminately assumed the shields and 
helmets of the auxiliary troops. No tribune or centurion encouraged them, 
every man acted on his own impulse and guidance, and the vilest found their 
chief incitement in the dejection of the good.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>Meanwhile, appalled by the roar of the increasing sedition and 
by the shouts which reached the city, <persName>Piso</persName> had overtaken Galba, who in the 
interval had quitted the palace, and was approaching the Forum. Already 
Marius Celsus had brought back discouraging tidings. And now some advised 
that the Emperor should return to the palace, others that he should make for 
the Capitol, many again that he should occupy the Rostra, though most did 
but oppose the opinions of others, while, as ever happens in these 
ill-starred counsels, plans for which the opportunity had slipped away 
seemed the best. It is said that <persName>Laco</persName>, without Galba's knowledge, meditated 
the death of Vinius, either hoping by this execution to appease the fury of 
the soldiers, or believing him to be an accomplice of <persName>Otho</persName>, or, it may be, 
out of mere hatred. The time and the place however made him hesitate; he 
knew that a massacre once begun is not easily checked. His plan too was 
disconcerted by a succession of alarming tidings, and the desertion of 
immediate adherents. So languid was now the zeal of those who had at first 
been eager to display their fidelity and courage.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>Galba was hurried to and fro with every movement of the surging 
crowd; the halls and temples all around were thronged with spectators of 
this mournful sight. Not a voice was heard from the people or even from the 
rabble. Everywhere were terror-stricken countenances, and ears turned to 
catch every sound. It was a scene neither of agitation nor of repose, but 
there reigned the silence of profound alarm and profound indignation. <persName>Otho</persName> 
however was told that they were arming the mob. He ordered his men

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DEATH OF GALBA</note>
to hurry on at full speed, and 
to anticipate the danger. Then did Roman soldiers rush forward like men who 
had to drive a Vologeses or Pacorus from the ancestral throne of the 
Arsacid&aelig;, not as though they were hastening to murder their aged and 
defenceless Emperor. In all the terror of their arms, and at the full speed 
of their horses, they burst into the Forum, thrusting aside the crowd and 
trampling on the Senate. Neither the sight of the Capitol, nor the sanctity 
of the overhanging temples, nor the thought of rulers past or future, could 
deter them from committing a crime, which any one succeeding to power must 
avenge.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>When this armed array was 
seen to approach, the standard-bearer of the cohort that escorted Galba (he 
is said to have been one Atilius Vergilio) tore off and dashed upon the 
ground Galba's effigy. At this signal the feeling of all the troops declared 
itself plainly for <persName>Otho</persName>. The Forum was deserted by the flying populace. 
Weapons were pointed against all who hesitated. Near the lake of Curtius, Galba was thrown out of his litter and fell to 
the ground, through the alarm of his bearers. His last words have been 
variously reported according as men hated or admired him. Some have said 
that he asked in a tone of entreaty what wrong he had done, and begged a few 
days for the payment of the donative. The more general account is, that he 
voluntarily offered his neck to the murderers, and bade them haste and 
strike, if it seemed to be for the good of the Commonwealth. To those who 
slew him it mattered not what he said. About the actual murderer nothing is 
clearly known. Some have recorded the name of Terentius, an enrolled 
pensioner, others that of Lecanius; but it is the current report that one 
Camurius, a soldier of the 15th legion, completely severed his throat by 
treading his sword down upon it. The rest of the soldiers foully mutilated 
his arms and legs, for his breast was protected, and in their savage 
ferocity inflicted many wounds even on the headless trunk.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>They next fell on T. Vinius; and in his case also 
it is not known whether the fear of instant death choked his utterance, or 
whether he cried out that <persName>Otho</persName> had not given orders to slay him. Either he 
invented this in his terror, or he thus confessed his share in the 
conspiracy. His life and

character incline us rather to believe 
that he was an accomplice in the crime which he certainly caused. He fell in 
front of the temple of the Divine Julius, and at the first blow, which 
struck him on the back of the knee; immediately afterwards Julius Carus, a 
legionary, ran him through the body.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>A noble example of manhood was on that day witnessed by our age in 
Sempronius Densus. He was a centurion in a cohort of the Pr&aelig;torian 
Guard, and had been appointed by Galba to escort <persName>Piso</persName>. Rushing, dagger in 
hand, to meet the armed men, and upbraiding them with their crime, he drew 
the attention of the murderers on himself by his exclamations and gestures, 
and thus gave <persName>Piso</persName>, wounded as he was, an opportunity of escape. <persName>Piso</persName> made 
his way to the temple of <persName>Vesta</persName>, where he was admitted by the compassion of 
one of the public slaves, who concealed him in his chamber. There, not 
indeed through the sanctity of the place or its worship, but through the 
obscurity of his hiding-place, he obtained a respite from instant 
destruction, till there came, by <persName>Otho</persName>'s direction and specially eager to 
slay him, Sulpicius Florus, of the British auxiliary infantry, to whom Galba 
had lately given the citizenship, and Statius Murcus, one of the body-guard. 
<persName>Piso</persName> was dragged out by these men and slaughtered in the entrance of the 
temple.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>There was, we are told, no 
death of which <persName>Otho</persName> heard with greater joy, no head which he surveyed with 
so insatiable a gaze. Perhaps it was, that his mind was then for the first 
time relieved from all anxiety, and so had leisure to rejoice; perhaps there 
was with Galba something to recall departed majesty, with Vinius some 
thought of old friendship, which troubled with mournful images even that 
ruthless heart; <persName>Piso</persName>'s death, as that of an enemy and a rival, he felt to be 
a right and lawful subject of rejoicing. The heads were fixed upon poles and 
carried about among the standards of the cohorts, close to the eagle of the 
legion, while those who had struck the blow, those who had been present, 
those who whether truly or falsely boasted of the act, as of some great and 
memorable achievement, vied in displaying their bloodstained hands. 
Vitellius afterwards

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">PISO'S DEATH; SOLDIERS IN 
SADDLE</note>
found more than 120 memorials from persons who claimed a 
reward for some notable service on that day. All these persons he ordered to 
be sought out and slain, not to honour Galba, but to comply with the 
traditional policy of rulers, who thus provide protection for the present 
and vengeance for the future.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>One 
would have thought it a different Senate, a different people. All rushed to 
the camp, outran those who were close to them, and struggled with those who 
were before, inveighed against Galba, praised the wisdom of the soldiers, 
covered the hand of <persName>Otho</persName> with kisses; the more insincere their 
demonstrations, the more they multiplied them. Nor did <persName>Otho</persName> repulse the 
advances of individuals, while he checked the greed and ferocity of the 
soldiers by word and look. They demanded that Marius Celsus, consul elect, 
Galba's faithful friend to the very last moment, should be led to execution, 
loathing his energy and integrity as if they were vices. It was evident that 
they were seeking to begin massacre and plunder, and the proscription of all 
the most virtuous citizens, and <persName>Otho</persName> had not yet sufficient authority to 
prevent crime, though he could command it. He feigned anger, and ordered him 
to be loaded with chains, declaring that he was to suffer more signal 
punishment, and thus he rescued him from immediate destruction.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>Every thing was then ordered according to 
the will of the soldiery. The Pr&aelig;torians chose their own prefects. One 
was Plotius Firmus, who had once been in the ranks, had afterwards commanded 
the watch, and who, while Galba was yet alive, had embraced the cause of 
<persName>Otho</persName>. With him was associated Licinius Proculus, <persName>Otho</persName>'s intimate friend, and 
consequently suspected of having encouraged his schemes. Flavius Sabinus 
they appointed prefect of the city, thus adopting <persName>Nero</persName>'s choice, in whose 
reign he had held the same office, though many in choosing him had an eye to 
his brother Vespasian. A demand was then made, that the fees for furloughs 
usually paid to the centurions should be abolished. These the common 
soldiers paid as a kind of annual tribute. A fourth part of every company 
might be scattered on furlough, or even loiter about the camp, provided that 
they paid the fees to the centurions.

No one cared about the 
amount of the tax, or the way in which it was raised. It was by robbery, 
plunder, or the most servile occupations that the soldiers' holiday was 
purchased. The man with the fullest purse was worn out with toil and cruel 
usage till he bought his furlough. His means exhausted by this outlay, and 
his energies utterly relaxed by idleness, the once rich and vigorous soldier 
returned to his company a poor and spiritless man. One after another was 
ruined by the same poverty and license, and rushed into mutiny and 
dissension, and finally into civil war. <persName>Otho</persName>, however, not to alienate the 
affections of the centurions by an act of bounty to the ranks, promised that 
his own purse should pay these annual sums. It was undoubtedly a salutary 
reform, and was afterwards under good emperors established as a permanent 
rule of the service. <persName>Laco</persName>, prefect of the city, who had been ostensibly 
banished to an island, was assassinated by an enrolled pensioner, sent on by 
<persName>Otho</persName> to do the deed. Martianus Icelus, being but a freedman, was publicly 
executed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>A day spent in crime found 
its last horror in the rejoicings that concluded it. The Pr&aelig;tor of the 
city summoned the Senate; the rest of the Magistrates vied with each other 
in their flatteries. The Senators hastily assembled and conferred by decree 
upon <persName>Otho</persName> the tribunitial office, the name of Augustus, and every imperial 
honour. All strove to extinguish the remembrance of those taunts and 
invectives, which had been thrown out at random, and which no one supposed 
were rankling in his heart. Whether he had forgotten, or only postponed his 
resentment, the shortness of his reign left undecided. The Forum yet 
streamed with blood, when he was borne in a litter over heaps of dead to the 
Capitol, and thence to the palace. He suffered the bodies to be given up for 
burial, and to be burnt. For <persName>Piso</persName>, the last rites were performed by his wife 
Verania and his brother Scribonianus; for Vinius, by his daughter Crispina, 
their heads having been discovered and purchased from the murderers, who had 
reserved them for sale.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>Piso, who was 
then completing his thirty-first year, had enjoyed more fame than good 
fortune. His brothers, Magnus and Crassus, had been put to death by 
Claudius

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">BEGINNINGS OF OTHO'S REIGN</note>
and 
<persName>Nero</persName> respectively. He was himself for many years an exile, for four days a 
C&aelig;sar, and Galba's hurried adoption of him only gave him this 
privilege over his elder brother, that he perished first. Vinius had lived 
to the age of fifty-seven, with many changes of character. His father was of 
a pr&aelig;torian family, his maternal grandfather was one of the 
proscribed. He had disgraced himself in his first campaign when he served 
under the legate Calvisius Sabinus. That officer's wife, urged by a perverse 
curiosity to view the camp, entered it by night in the disguise of a 
soldier, and after extending the insulting frolic to the watches and the 
general arrangements of the army, actually dared to commit the act of 
adultery in the head-quarters. Vinius was charged with having participated 
in her guilt, and by order of Caius was loaded with irons. The altered times 
soon restored him to liberty. He then enjoyed an uninterrupted succession of 
honours, first filling the pr&aelig;torship, and then commanding a legion 
with general satisfaction, but he subsequently incurred the degrading 
imputation of having pilfered a gold cup at the table of Claudius, who the 
next day directed that he alone should be served on earthenware. Yet as 
pro-consul of <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName> he administered the government with strict 
integrity. When forced by his friendship with Galba to a dangerous 
elevation, he shewed himself bold, crafty, and enterprising; and whether he 
applied his powers to vice or virtue, was always equally energetic. His will 
was made void by his vast wealth; that of Piso owed its validity to his 
poverty.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>The body of Galba lay for a 
long time neglected, and subjected, through the license which the darkness 
permitted, to a thousand indignities, till Argius his steward, who had been 
one of his slaves, gave it a humble burial in his master's private gardens. 
His head, which the sutlers and camp-followers had fixed on a pole and 
mangled, was found only the next day in front of the tomb of Patrobius, a 
freedman of Nero's, whom Galba had executed. It was put with the body, which 
had by that time been reduced to ashes. Such was the end of Servius Galba, 
who in his seventy-three years had lived prosperously through the reigns of 
five Emperors, and had been more fortunate under the rule of others

than he was in his own. His family could boast an ancient nobility, 
his wealth was great. His character was of an average kind, rather free from 
vices, than distinguished by virtues. He was not regardless of fame, nor yet 
vainly fond of it. Other men's money he did not covet, with his own he was 
parsimonious, with that of the State avaricious. To his freedmen and friends 
he shewed a forbearance, which, when he had fallen into worthy hands, could 
not be blamed; when, however, these persons were worthless, he was even 
culpably blind. The nobility of his birth and the perils of the times made 
what was really indolence pass for wisdom. While in the vigour of life, he 
enjoyed a high military reputation in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; as 
 proconsul he ruled <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> with moderation, and when 
advanced in years shewed the same integrity in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Eastern 
Spain</placeName>. He seemed greater than a subject while he was yet in a subject's 
rank, and by common consent would have been pronounced equal to empire, had 
he never been emperor.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>The alarm of 
the capital, which trembled to see the atrocity of these recent crimes, and 
to think of the old character of Otho, was heightened into terror by fresh 
news about Vitellius, news which had been suppressed before the murder of 
Galba, in order to make it appear that only the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Upper Germany</placeName> had revolted. That two men, who for 
shamelessness, indolence, and profligacy, were the most worthless of 
mortals, had been selected, it would seem, by some fatality to ruin the 
Empire, became the open complaint, not only of the Senate and the Knights, 
who had some stake and interest in the country, but even of the common 
people. It was no longer to the late horrors of a dreadful peace, but to the 
recollections of the civil wars, that men recurred, speaking of how the 
capital had been taken by Roman armies, how <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> 
 had been wasted and the provinces spoiled, of <placeName key="perseus,Pharsalos">Pharsalia</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Perusia">Perusia</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Mutina">Mutina</placeName>, and all the 
familiar names of great public disasters. "The world," they said, "was 
well-nigh turned upside down when the struggle for empire was between worthy 
competitors, yet the Empire continued to exist after the victories of Caius 
Julius and C&aelig;sar Augustus; the Republic would have continued to exist 
under Pompey and <persName>Brutus</persName>. And is
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">NEW 
RIVALRIES</note>
it for <persName>Otho</persName> or for Vitellius that we are now to repair to 
the temples? Prayers for either would be impious, vows for either a 
blasphemy, when from their conflict you can only learn that the conqueror 
must be the worse of the two." Some were speculating on Vespasian and the 
armies of the East. Vespasian was indeed preferable to either, yet they
shuddered at the idea of another war, of other massacres. Even about 
Vespasian there were doubtful rumours, and he, unlike any of his 
predecessors, was changed for the better by power.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>I will now describe the origin and occasion of the 
revolt of Vitellius. After the destruction of Julius <persName>Vindex</persName> and his whole 
force, the army, flushed with the delights of plunder and glory, as men 
might well be who had been fortunate enough to triumph without toil or 
danger in a most lucrative war, began to hanker after campaigns and battles, 
and to prefer prize money to pay. They had long endured a service which the 
character of the country and of the climate and the rigours of military 
discipline rendered at once unprofitable and severe. But that discipline, 
inexorable as it is in times of peace, is relaxed by civil strife, when on 
both sides are found the agents of corruption, and treachery goes 
unpunished. They had men, arms and horses, more than enough for all purposes 
of utility and show, but before the war they had been acquainted only with 
the companies and squadrons of their own force as the various armies were 
separated from each other by the limits of their respective provinces. But 
the legions, having been concentrated to act against <persName>Vindex</persName>, and having thus 
learnt to measure their own strength against the strength of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, were now on the look out for another war and for 
new conflicts. They called their neighbours, not "allies" as of old, but 
"the enemy" and "the vanquished." Nor did that part of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> which borders on the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> 
fail to espouse the same cause, and to shew the bitterest hostility in 
inflaming the army against the Galbianists, that being the name, which in 
their contempt for Vindex they had given to the party. The rage first 
excited against the Sequani and &AElig;dui extended to other states in 
proportion to their wealth, and they revelled in imagination on the

storm of cities, the plunder of estates, the sack of dwelling-houses. 
But, besides the rapacity and arrogance which are the special faults of 
superior strength, they were exasperated by the bravadoes of the Gallic 
people, who in a spirit of insult to the army boasted of how they had been 
relieved by Galba from a fourth part of their tribute, and had received 
grants from the State. There was also a report, ingeniously spread and 
recklessly believed, to the effect that the legions were being decimated, 
and all the most energetic centurions dismissed. From all quarters arrived 
the most alarming tidings. The reports from the capital were unfavourable, 
while the disaffection of the colony of <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName>, 
which obstinately adhered to <persName>Nero</persName>, gave rise to a multitude of rumours. But 
it was in the army itself, in its hatreds, its fears, and even in the 
security with which a review of its own strength inspired it, that there was 
the most abundant material for the exercise of imagination and 
credulity.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>Just before December 1 in 
the preceding year, Aulus Vitellius had visited <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Lower 
Germany</placeName>, and had carefully inspected the winter quarters of the 
legions. Many had their rank restored to them, sentences of degradation were 
cancelled, and marks of disgrace partially removed. In most cases he did but 
court popularity, in some he exercised a sound discretion, making a salutary 
change from the meanness and rapacity which Fonteius <persName>Capito</persName> had shown in 
bestowing and withdrawing promotion. But he seemed a greater personage than 
a simple consular legate, and all his acts were invested with an unusual 
importance. Though sterner judges pronounced Vitellius to be a man of low 
tastes, those who were partial to him attributed to geniality and good 
nature the immoderate and indiscriminate prodigality, with which he gave 
away what was his own, and squandered what did not belong to him. Besides 
this, men themselves eager for power were ready to represent his very vices 
as virtues. As there were in both armies many of obedient and quiet habits, 
so there were many who were as unprincipled as they were energetic; but 
distinguished above all for boundless ambition and singular daring were the 
legates of the legions, Fabius Valens and Alienus C&aelig;cina.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">RISE OF VITELLIUS IN <placeName key="tgn,7000084">GERMANY</placeName></note>
One of these men, Valens, had taken 
offence against Galba, under the notion that he had not shewn proper 
gratitude for his services in discovering to him the hesitation of Verginius 
and crushing the plans of Capito. He now began to urge Vitellius to action. 
He enlarged on the zeal of the soldiery. "You have," he said, "everywhere a 
great reputation; you will find nothing to stop you in Hordeonius Flaccus; 
 <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> will be with you; the German auxiliaries 
will follow your standard. All the provinces waver in their allegiance. The 
Empire is held on the precarious tenure of an aged life, and must shortly 
pass into other hands. You have only to open your arms, and to meet the 
advances of fortune. It was well for Verginius to hesitate, the scion of a 
mere Equestrian family, and son of a father unknown to fame: he would have 
been unequal to empire, had he accepted it, and yet been safe though he 
refused it. But from the honours of a father who was thrice consul, was 
censor and colleague of C&aelig;sar, Vitellius has long since derived an 
imperial rank, while he has lost the security that belongs to a 
subject."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>These arguments roused the 
indolent temper of the man, yet roused him rather to wish than to hope for 
the throne. Meanwhile however in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Upper Germany</placeName> 
C&aelig;cina, young and handsome, of commanding stature, and of boundless 
ambition, had attracted the favour of the soldiery by his skilful oratory 
and his dignified mien. This man had, when qu&aelig;stor in <placeName key="tgn,7002758">B&aelig;tica</placeName>, attached himself with zeal to the party of 
Galba, who had appointed him, young as he was, to the command of a legion, 
but, it being afterwards discovered that he had embezzled the public money, 
Galba directed that he should be prosecuted for peculation. C&aelig;cina, 
grievously offended, determined to throw everything into confusion, and 
under the disasters of his country to conceal his private dishonour. There 
were not wanting in the army itself the elements of civil strife. The whole 
of it had taken part in the war against Vindex; it had not passed over to 
Galba till Nero fell; even then in this transference of its allegiance it 
had been anticipated by the armies of <placeName key="7000084">Lower Germany</placeName>. 
Besides this, the Treveri, the <placeName key="tgn,7008343">Lingones</placeName>, and the other states which Galba 
had most seriously in-

jured by his severe edicts and by the 
confiscation of their territory, were particularly close to the 
winter-quarters of the legions. Thence arose seditious conferences, a 
soldiery demoralized by intercourse with the inhabitants of the country, and 
tendencies in favour of Verginius, which could easily be turned to the 
profit of any other person.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>The 
<placeName key="tgn,7008343">Lingones</placeName>, following an old custom, had sent presents to the legions, right 
hands clasped together, an emblem of friendship. Their envoys, who had 
assumed a studied appearance of misery and distress, passed through the 
headquarters and the men's tents, and complaining, now of their own wrongs, 
now of the rewards bestowed on the neighbouring states, and, when they found 
the soldiers' ears open to their words, of the perils and insults to which 
the army itself was exposed, inflamed the passions of the troops. The 
legions were on the verge of mutiny, when Hordeonius Flaccus ordered the 
envoys to depart, and to make their departure more secret, directed them to 
leave the camp by night. Hence arose a frightful rumour, many asserting that 
the envoys had been killed, and that, unless the soldiers provided for their 
own safety, the next thing would be, that the most energetic of their 
number, and those who had complained of their present condition, would be 
slaughtered under cover of night, when the rest of the army would know 
nothing of their fate. The legions then bound themselves by a secret 
agreement. Into this the auxiliary troops were admitted. At first objects of 
suspicion, from the idea that their infantry and cavalry were being 
concentrated in preparation for an attack on the legions, these troops soon 
became especially zealous in the scheme. The bad find it easier to agree for 
purposes of war than to live in harmony during peace.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>Yet it was to Galba that the legions of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Lower Germany</placeName> took the oath of fidelity annually 
administered on the first of January. It was done, however, after long 
delay, and then only by a few voices from the foremost ranks, while the rest 
preserved an absolute silence, every one waiting for some bold demonstration 
from his neighbour, in obedience to that innate tendency of men, which makes 
them quick to follow where they are slow to lead. And

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">ARMY IN <placeName key="tgn,7000084">GERMANY</placeName> DISAFFECTED</note>
even in 
the various legions there was a difference of feeling. The soldiers of the 
1st and of the 5th were so mutinous, that some of them threw stones at the 
images of Galba. The 15th and 16th legions ventured on nothing beyond uproar 
and threatening expressions. They were on the watch for something that might 
lead to an outbreak. In the Upper army, however, the 4th and 13th legions, 
which were stationed in the same winter-quarters, proceeded on this same 
first of January to break in pieces the images of Galba, the 4th legion 
being foremost, the 18th shewing some reluctance, but soon joining with the 
rest. Not however to seem to throw off all their reverence for the Empire, 
they sought to dignify their oath with the now obsolete names of the Senate 
and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Not a single legate or tribune 
exerted himself for Galba; some, as is usual in a tumult were even 
conspicuously active in mutiny, though no one delivered anything like a 
formal harangue or spoke from a tribunal. Indeed there was as yet no one to 
be obliged by such services.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p>Hordeonius Flaccus, the consular legate, was present and witnessed this 
outrage, but he dared neither check the furious mutineers, nor keep the 
wavering to their duty, nor encourage the well affected. Indolent and timid, 
he was preserved from guilt only by his sloth. Four Centurions of the 18th 
legion, Nonius Receptus, Donatius Valens, Romilius Marcellus, Calpurnius 
Repentinus, striving to protect the images of Galba, were swept away by a 
rush of the soldiers and put in irons. After this no one retained any sense 
of duty, any recollection of his late allegiance, but, as usually happens in 
mutinies, the side of the majority became the side of all. In the course of 
the night of the 1st of January, the standard-bearer of the 4th legion, 
coming to the <placeName key="tgn,1003171">Colonia Agrippinensis</placeName>, announced to 
Vitellius, who was then at dinner, the news that the 4th and 18th legions 
had thrown down the images of Galba, and had sworn allegiance to the Senate 
and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Such a form of oath appeared 
meaningless. It was determined to seize the doubtful fortune of the hour, 
and to offer an Emperor to their choice, Vitellius sent envoys to the 
legions and their legates, who were to say that the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Upper Germany</placeName> had revolted
from Galba, that 
it was consequently necessary for them, either to make war on the revolters, 
or, if they preferred peace and harmony, to create an Emperor, and who were 
to suggest, that it would be less perilous to accept than to look for a 
chief.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>The nearest winter-quarters 
were those of the first legion, and Fabius Valens was the most energetic of 
the legates. This officer in the course of the following day entered the <placeName key="tgn,1003171">Colonia Agrippinensis</placeName> with the cavalry of the legion and 
of the auxiliaries, and together with them saluted Vitellius as Emperor. All 
the legions belonging to the same province followed his example with 
prodigious zeal, and the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Upper Germany</placeName> 
abandoned the specious names of the Senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and on the 3rd of January declared for Vitellius. 
One could be sure that during those previous two days it had not really been 
the army of the State. The inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1003171">Colonia 
Agrippinensis</placeName>, the Treveri, and the <placeName key="tgn,7008343">Lingones</placeName>, shewed as much zeal as 
the army, making offers of personal service, of horses, of arms and of 
money, according as each felt himself able to assist the cause by his own 
exertions, by his wealth, or by his talents. Nor was this done only by the 
leading men in the colonies or the camps, who had abundant means at hand, 
and might indulge great expectations in the event of victory, but whole 
companies down to the very ranks offered instead of money their rations, 
their belts, and the bosses, which, richly decorated with silver, adorned 
their arms; so strong were the promptings from without, their own 
enthusiasm, and even the suggestions of avarice.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>Vitellius, after bestowing high commendation on the zeal of the 
soldiers, proceeded to distribute among Roman Knights the offices of the 
Imperial court usually held by freedmen. He paid the furlough fees to the 
centurions out of the Imperial treasury. While in most instances he 
acquiesced in the fury of the soldiers, who clamoured for numerous 
executions, in some few he eluded it under the pretence of imprisoning the 
accused. Pompeius Propinquus, procurator of <placeName>Belgica</placeName>, 
was immediately put to death. Julius Burdo, prefect of the German fleet, he 
contrived to withdraw from the scene of danger. The resentment of the 
army

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIUS SALUTED AS EMPEROR</note>
had been 
inflamed against this officer by the belief, that it was he who had invented 
the charges and planned the treachery which had destroyed Capito. The memory 
of Capito was held in high favour, and with that enraged soldiery it was 
possible to slaughter in open day, but to pardon only by stealth. He was 
kept in prison, and only set at liberty after the victory of Vitellius, when 
the resentment of the soldiery had subsided. Meanwhile, by way of a victim, 
the centurion Crispinus was given up to them; this man had actually imbued 
his hands in the blood of Capito. Consequently he was to those who cried for 
vengeance a more notorious criminal, and to him who punished a cheaper 
sacrifice.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>Julius Civilis, a man of 
commanding influence among the Batavi, was next rescued from like 
circumstances of peril, lest that high-spirited nation should be alienated 
by his execution. There were indeed in the territory of the <placeName key="tgn,7008343">Lingones</placeName> eight 
Batavian cohorts, which formed the auxiliary force of the 14th legion, but 
which had, among the many dissensions of the time, withdrawn from it; a body 
of troops which, to whatever side they might incline, would, whether as 
allies or enemies, throw a vast weight into the scale. Vitellius ordered the 
centurions Nonnius, Donatius, Romilius, and Calpurnius, of whom I have 
before spoken, to be executed. They had been convicted of the crime of 
fidelity, among rebels the worst of crimes. New adherents soon declared 
themselves in Valerius Asiaticus, legate of the Province of <placeName>Belgica</placeName>, whom Vitellius soon after made his son-in-law, 
and Junius Bl&aelig;sus, governor of Gallia Lugdunensis, who brought with 
him the Italian Legion and the Taurine Horse, which was stationed at <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName>. The armies of <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName> made no delay in at once joining Vitellius, 
 and even in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> there was no hesitation.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p>Of that province Trebellius Maximus was 
governor, a man whose sordid avarice made him an object of contempt and 
hatred to the army. His unpopularity was heightened by the efforts of 
Roscius C&aelig;lius, the legate of the 20th legion, who had long been on 
bad terms with him, and who now seized the opportunity of a civil war to 
break out into greater violence. Trebellius charged him with mutinous 
de-

signs, and with disturbing the regularity of military 
discipline; C&aelig;lius retorted on Trebellius the accusation of having 
plundered and impoverished the legions. Meanwhile all obedience in the army 
was destroyed by these disgraceful quarrels between its commanders, and the 
feud rose to such a height that Trebellius was insulted even by the 
auxiliaries, and finding himself altogether isolated, as the infantry and 
cavalry sided with C&aelig;lius, he fled for safety to Vitellius. Yet the 
province still enjoyed tranquility, though its consular governor had been 
driven from it. It was now ruled by the legates of the legions, who were 
equal as to lawful authority, though the audacity of C&aelig;lius made him 
the more powerful.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>After the army of 
 <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> had joined him, Vitellius, who had now a 
prodigious force and vast resources, determined that there should be two 
generals and two lines of march for the contemplated war. Fabius Valens was 
ordered to win over, if possible, or, if they refused his overtures, to 
ravage the provinces of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and to invade <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by way of the <placeName>Cottian 
Alps</placeName>; C&aelig;cina to take the nearer route, and to march down from 
the
Penine range. To Valens were entrusted the picked troops of the army of 
<placeName key="tgn,7000084">Lower Germany</placeName> with the eagle of the 5th legion and 
the auxiliary infantry and cavalry, to the number of 40,000 armed men; 
C&aelig;cina commanded 30,000 from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Upper Germany</placeName>, 
the strength of his force being one legion, the 21st. Both had also some 
German auxiliaries, and from this source Vitellius, who was to follow with 
his whole military strength, completed his own forces.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>Wonderful was the contrast between the army and the 
Emperor. The army was all eagerness; they cried out war, while <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> yet wavered, and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> 
hesitated. "The winter," they said, "the delays of a cowardly inaction must 
not stop us. We must invade <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, we must seize the 
capital; in civil strife, where action is more needed than deliberation, 
nothing is safer than haste." Vitellius, on the contrary, was sunk in sloth, 
and anticipated the enjoyment of supreme power in indolent luxury and 
prodigal festivities. By mid-day he was half-intoxicated, and heavy with 
food; yet the ardour and vigour of the soldiers themselves dis-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">PLANS TO INVADE <placeName key="tgn,1000080">ITALY</placeName></note>
charged all the duties of a general as well 
as if the Emperor had been present to stimulate the energetic by hope and 
the indolent by fear. Ready to march and eager for action, they loudly 
demanded the signal for starting; the title of Germanicus was at once 
bestowed on Vitellius, that of C&aelig;sar he refused to accept, even after 
his victory. It was observed as a happy omen for Fabius Valens and the 
forces which he was conducting to the campaign, that on the very day on 
which they set out an eagle moved with a gentle flight before the army as it 
advanced, as if to guide it on its way. And for a long distance so loudly 
did the soldiers shout in their joy, so calm and unterrified was the bird, 
that it was taken as no doubtful omen of great and successful 
achievements.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>The territory of the 
Treveri they entered with all the security naturally felt among allies. But 
at <placeName key="tgn,7008418">Divodurum</placeName>, a town of the Mediomatrici, though 
they had been received with the most courteous hospitality, a sudden panic 
mastered them. In a moment they took up arms to massacre an innocent people, 
not for the sake of plunder, or fired by the lust of spoil, but in a wild 
frenzy arising from causes so vague that it was very difficult to apply a 
remedy. Soothed at length by the entreaties of their general, they refrained 
from utterly destroying the town; yet as many as four thousand human beings 
were slaughtered. Such an alarm was spread through <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, that as the army advanced, whole states, headed by 
their magistrates and with prayers on their lips, came forth to meet it, 
while the women and children lay prostrate along the roads, and all else 
that might appease an enemy's fury was offered, though war there was none, 
to secure the boon of peace.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>Valens 
received the tidings of the murder of Galba and the accession of <persName>Otho</persName> while 
he was in the country of the Leuci. The feelings of the soldiers were not 
seriously affected either with joy or alarm; they were intent on war. <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> however ceased to hesitate; <persName>Otho</persName> and Vitellius it 
hated equally, Vitellius it also feared. The next territory was that of the 
Lingones, who were loyal to Vitellius. The troops were kindly received, and 
they vied with each other in good behaviour. This happy state of things, 
however, was of short

duration owing to the violence of the 
auxiliary infantry, which had detached itself, as before related, from the 
14th legion, and had been incorporated by Valens with his army. First came 
angry words, then a brawl between the Batavi and the legionaries, which as 
the partialities of the soldiers espoused one or another of the parties was 
almost kindled into a battle, and would have been so, had not Valens by 
punishing a few, reminded the Batavi of the authority which they had now 
forgotten. Against the &AElig;dui a pretext for war was sought in vain. That 
people, when ordered to furnish arms and money, voluntarily added a supply 
of provisions. What the &AElig;dui did from fear, the people of <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName> did with delight. Yet the Italian legion and 
the Taurine Horse were withdrawn. It was resolved that the 18th cohort 
should be left there, as it was their usual winter-quarters. Manlius Valens, 
legate of the Italian legion, though he had served the party well, was held 
in no honour by Vitellius. Fabius Valens had defamed him by secret charges 
of which he knew nothing, publicly praising him all the while, that he might 
the less suspect the treachery.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>The 
 old feud between <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName> had been kindled afresh by the late war. They had 
inflicted many losses on each other so continuously and so savagely that 
they could not have been fighting only for <persName>Nero</persName> or Galba. Galba had made his 
displeasure the occasion for diverting into the Imperial treasury the 
revenues of <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName>, while he had treated <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName> with marked respect. Thence came rivalry and 
dislike, and the two states, separated only by a river, were linked together 
by perpetual feud. Accordingly the people of <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName> began to work on the passions of individual 
 soldiers, and to goad them into destroying <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName>, 
by reminding them, how that people had besieged their colony, had abetted 
the attempts of <persName>Vindex</persName>, and had recently raised legions for Galba. After 
parading these pretexts for quarrel, they pointed out how vast would be the 
plunder. From secret encouragement they passed to open entreaty. "Go," they 
said, "to avenge us and utterly destroy this home of Gallic rebellion. There 
all are foreigners and enemies; we are a Roman colony, a part of the Roman 
army, sharers in your successes and reverses.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="tgn,1000070">GAUL</placeName> FOR VITELLIUS</note>
Fortune may declare against 
us. Do not abandon us to an angry foe."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>By these and many similar arguments they so wrought upon the 
troops, that even the legates and the leaders of the party did not think it 
possible to check their fury; but the people of <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName>, aware of their danger, assumed the veils and 
chaplets of suppliants, and, as the army approached, clasped the weapons, 
knees and feet of the soldiers, and so turned them from their purpose. 
Valens also made each soldier a present of 300 sesterces. After that the 
antiquity and rank of the colony prevailed, and the intercession of Valens, 
who charged them to respect the life and welfare of the inhabitants, 
received a favourable hearing. They were however publicly mulcted of their 
arms, and furnished the soldiers with all kinds of supplies from their 
private means. Report, however, has uniformly asserted, that Valens himself 
was bought with a vast sum. Poor for many years and suddenly growing rich, 
he could but ill conceal the change in his fortunes, indulging without 
moderation the appetites which a protracted poverty had inflamed, and, after 
a youth of indigence, becoming prodigal in old age. The army then proceeded 
by slow marches through the territory of the Allobroges and Vocontii, the 
very length of each day's march and the changes of encampment being made a 
matter of traffic by the general, who concluded disgraceful bargains to the 
injury of the holders of land and the magistrates of the different states, 
and used such menaces, that at <placeName key="tgn,1034134">Lucus</placeName>, a municipal 
town of the Vocontii, he was on the point of setting fire to the place, when 
a present of money soothed his rage. When money was not forthcoming he was 
bought off by sacrifices to his lust. Thus he made his way to the <placeName>Alps</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p>C&aelig;cina 
revelled more freely in plunder and blood shed. His restless spirit had been 
provoked by the Helvetii a Gallic race famous once for its warlike 
population, afterwards for the associations of its name. Of the murder of 
Galba they knew nothing, and they rejected the authority of Vitellius. The 
war originated in the rapacity and impatience of the 21st legion, who had 
seized some money sent to pay the garrison of a fortress, which the 
Helvetii

had long held with their own troops and at their own 
expense. The Helvetii in their indignation intercepted some letters written 
in the name of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, which were on 
 their way to the legions of <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, and detained 
the centurion and some of his soldiers in custody. C&aelig;cina, eager for 
war, hastened to punish every delinquency, as it occurred, before the 
offender could repent. Suddenly moving his camp he ravaged a place, which 
during a long period of peace had grown up into something like a town, and 
which was much resorted to as an agreeable watering-place. Despatches were 
sent to the Rh&aelig;tian auxiliaries, instructing them to attack the 
Helvetii in the rear while the legion was engaging them in front.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>Bold before the danger came and timid in the 
moment of peril, the Helvetii, though at the commencement of the movement 
they had chosen Claudius Severus for their leader, knew not how to use their 
arms, to keep their ranks, or to act in concert. A pitched battle with 
veteran troops would be destruction, a siege would be perilous with 
fortifications old and ruinous. On the one side was C&aelig;cina at the head 
of a powerful army, on the other were the auxiliary infantry and cavalry of 
 <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName> and the youth of that province, inured 
to arms and exercised in habits of warfare. All around were slaughter and 
devastation. Wandering to and fro between the two armies, the Helvetii threw 
aside their arms, and with a large proportion of wounded and stragglers fled 
for refuge to <placeName>Mount Vocetius</placeName>. They were immediately 
dislodged by the attack of some Thracian infantry. Closely pursued by the 
Germans and Rh&aelig;tians they were cut down in their forests and even in 
their hiding places. Thousands were put to the sword, thousands more were 
sold into slavery. Every place having been completely destroyed, the army 
was marching in regular order on <placeName key="tgn,7007298">Aventicum</placeName>, the 
capital town, when a deputation was sent to surrender the city. This 
surrender was accepted. Julius Alpinus, one of the principal men, was 
executed by C&aelig;cina, as having been the promoter of the war. All the 
rest he left to the mercy or severity of Vitellius.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p>It is hard to say whether the envoys from <placeName key="tgn,7011731">Helvetia</placeName> found the Emperor or his army less merciful. 
"Exterminate

HELVETIANS</note>
the race," was the cry of the soldiers as they brandished 
their weapons, or shook their fists in the faces of the envoys. Even 
Vitellius himself did not refrain from threatening words and gestures, till 
at length Claudius Cossus, one of the Helvetian envoys, a man of well-known 
eloquence, but who then concealed the art of the orator under an assumption 
of alarm, and was therefore more effective, soothed the rage of the 
soldiers, who, like all multitudes, were liable to sudden impulses, and were 
now as inclined to pity as they had been extravagant in fury. Bursting into 
tears and praying with increasing earnestness for a milder sentence, they 
procured pardon and protection for the state.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p>C&aelig;cina while halting for a few days in the Helvetian 
territory, till he could learn the decision of Vitellius, and at the same 
time making preparations for the passage of the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, received from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> the 
good news, that Silius' Horse, which was quartered in the neighbourhood of 
 <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, had sworn allegiance to Vitellius. They had 
 served under him when he was Proconsul in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, 
from which place <persName>Nero</persName> had soon afterwards brought them, intending to send 
 them on before himself into <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, but had recalled 
them in consequence of the rebellion of <persName>Vindex</persName>. They were still in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and now at the instigation of their decurions, 
who knew nothing of <persName>Otho</persName>, but were bound to Vitellius, and who magnified the 
strength of the advancing legions and the fame of the German army, they 
joined the Vitellianists, and by way of a present to their new Prince they 
secured for him the strongest towns of the country north of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Mediolanum">Mediolanum</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Novaria">Novaria</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Eporedia">Eporedia</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Vercellae">Vercell&aelig;</placeName>. This C&aelig;cina had learnt from 
themselves. Aware that the widest part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> 
could not be held by such a force as a single squadron of cavalry, he sent 
on in advance the auxiliary infantry from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, <placeName>Lusitania</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName>, 
with the veteran troops from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and Petra's 
Horse, while he made a brief halt to consider whether he should pass over 
the Rh&aelig;tian range into <placeName>Noricum</placeName>, to attack 
Petronius, the procurator, who had collected some auxiliaries, and broken 
down the bridges over the rivers, and was thought to be faithful to <persName>Otho</persName>. 
Fearing however that he might lose the infantry and cavalry which he had 
sent on in advance, and at the same

time reflecting that more 
honour was to be gained by holding possession of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and that, wherever the decisive conflict might 
take place, <placeName>Noricum</placeName> would be included among the 
other prizes of victory, he marched the reserves and the heavy infantry 
through the Penine passes while the <placeName>Alps</placeName> were still 
covered with the snows of winter.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>Meanwhile <persName>Otho</persName>, to the surprise of all, was not sinking down into luxury and 
sloth. He deferred his pleasures, concealed his profligacy, and moulded his 
whole life to suit the dignity of empire. Men dreaded all the more virtues 
so false, and vices so certain to return. Marius Celsus, consul elect, whom 
he had rescued from the fury of the soldiers by pretending to imprison him, 
he now ordered to be summoned to the Capitol. He sought to acquire a 
reputation for clemency by sparing a distinguished man opposed to his own 
party. Celsus pleaded guilty to the charge of faithful adherence to Galba, 
and even made a merit of such an example of fidelity. <persName>Otho</persName> did not treat him 
as a man to be pardoned, and, unwilling to blend with the grace of 
reconciliation the memory of past hostility, at once admitted him to his 
intimate friendship, and soon afterwards appointed him to be one of his 
generals. By some fatality, as it seemed, Celsus maintained also to <persName>Otho</persName> a 
fidelity as irreproachable as it was unfortunate. The escape of Celsus 
gratified the leading men in the State, was generally praised by the people, 
and did not displease even the soldiers, who could not but admire the virtue 
which provoked their anger.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>Then 
followed as great a burst of joy, though from a less worthy cause, when the 
destruction of Tigellinus was achieved. Sophonius Tigellinus, a man of 
obscure birth, steeped in infamy from his boyhood, and shamelessly 
profligate in his old age, finding vice to be his quickest road to such 
offices as the command of the watch and of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard, and to 
other distinctions due to merit, went on to practise cruelty, rapacity, and 
all the crimes of maturer years. He perverted <persName>Nero</persName> to every kind of 
atrocity; he even ventured on some acts without the Emperor's knowledge, and 
ended by deserting and betraying him. Hence there was no criminal, whose 
doom was from opposite motives more importunately demanded, as well by 
those

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHO'S CONDUCT; DEATH OF 
TIGELLINUS</note>
who hated <persName>Nero</persName>, as by those who regretted him. During the 
reign of Galba Tigellinus had been screened by the influence of Vinius, who 
alleged that he had saved his daughter. And doubtless he had preserved her 
life, not indeed out of mercy, when he had murdered so many, but to secure 
for himself a refuge for the future. For all the greatest villains, 
distrusting the present, and dreading change, look for private friendship to 
shelter them from public detestation, caring not to be free from guilt, but 
only to ensure their turn in impunity. This enraged the people more than 
ever, the recent unpopularity of Vinius being superadded to their old hatred 
against Tigellinus. They rushed from every part of the city into the palace 
and forum, and bursting into the circus and theatre, where the mob enjoy a 
special license, broke out into seditious clamours. At length Tigellinus, 
having received at the springs of <placeName key="tgn,7009927">Sinuessa</placeName> a message 
that his last hour was come, amid the embraces and caresses of his 
mistresses and other unseemly delays, cut his throat with a razor, and 
aggravated the disgrace of an infamous life by a tardy and ignominious 
death.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>About the same time a demand 
was made for the execution of Galvia Crispinilla. Various artifices on the 
part of the Emperor, who incurred much obloquy by his duplicity, rescued her 
from the danger. She had instructed Nero in profligacy, had passed over into 
 <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, that she might urge Macer into rebellion, 
and had openly attempted to bring a famine upon <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Yet she afterwards gained universal popularity on 
the strength of her alliance with a man of consular rank, and lived unharmed 
through the reigns of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius. Soon she became powerful 
as a rich and childless woman, circumstances which have as great weight in 
good as in evil times.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>Meanwhile 
frequent letters, disfigured by unmanly flatteries, were addressed by Otho 
to Vitellius, with offers of wealth and favour and any retreat he might 
select for a life of prodigal indulgence. Vitellius made similar overtures. 
Their tone was at first pacific; and both exhibited a foolish and 
undignified hypocrisy. Then they seemed to quarrel, charging each other with 
debaucheries and the grossest crimes, and both spoke truth. Otho, having 
recalled the en-

voys whom Galba had sent, dispatched others, 
nominally from the Senate, to both the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, to the Italian legion, and to the troops 
quartered at <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName>. The envoys remained with 
Vitellius too readily to let it be supposed that they were detained. Some 
Pr&aelig;torians, whom Otho had attached to the embassy, ostensibly as a 
mark of distinction, were sent back before they could mix with the legions. 
Letters were also addressed by Fabius Valens in the name of the German army 
to the Pr&aelig;torian and city cohorts, extolling the strength of his 
party, and offering terms of peace. Valens even reproached them with having 
transferred the Imperial power to Otho, though it had so long before been 
entrusted to Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p>Thus they 
were assailed by promises as well as by threats, were told that they were 
not strong enough for war, but would lose nothing by peace. Yet all this did 
not shake the loyalty of the Pr&aelig;torians. Nevertheless secret 
emissaries were dispatched by Otho to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and 
by Vitellius to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Both failed in their object. 
Those of Vitellius escaped without injury, unnoticed in the vast multitude, 
knowing none, and themselves unknown. Those of Otho were betrayed by their 
strange faces in a place where all knew each other. Vitellius wrote to 
Titianus, Otho's brother, threatening him and his son with death, unless the 
lives of his mother and his children were spared. Both families remained 
uninjured. This in Otho's reign was perhaps due to fear; Vitellius was 
victorious, and gained all the credit of mercy.</p></div2>
 <div2 type="chapter" n="76"><p>The first encouraging tidings came to Otho from <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>. He heard that the legions of <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> had sworn allegiance to him. Similar 
intelligence was received from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and Cluvius 
Rufus was commended in an edict. Immediately afterwards it became known that 
  <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> had gone over to Vitellius. Even <placeName key="tgn,7002878">Aquitania</placeName>, bound though it was by the oath of allegiance 
to Otho which Julius Cordus had administered, did not long remain firm. 
Nowhere was there any loyalty or affection; men changed from one side to the 
other under the pressure of fear or necessity. It was this influence of fear 
that drew over to Vitellius the province of <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia 
Narbonensis</placeName>, which

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">PRAETORIANS LOYAL; 
PROVINCES WAVER</note>
turned readily to the side that was at once the 
nearer and the stronger. The distant provinces, and all the armies beyond 
the sea, still adhered to Otho, not from any attachment to his party, but 
because there was vast weight in the name of the capital and the prestige of 
the Senate, and also because the claims which they had first heard had 
prepossessed their minds. The army of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> 
   under Vespasian, and the legions of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> under 
   Mucianus, swore allegiance to Otho. <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and the 
   Eastern provinces were also governed in his name. <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> displayed the same obedience, <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> taking the lead. In that city Crescens, one of 
Nero's freedmen (for in evil times even this class makes itself a power in 
the State), without waiting for the sanction of the proconsul, Vipstanus 
Apronianus, had given an entertainment to the populace by way of rejoicings 
for the new reign, and the people, with extravagant zeal, hastened to make 
the usual demonstrations of joy. The example of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> was followed by the other cities of <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="77"><p>As the 
armies and provinces were thus divided, Vitellius, in order to secure the 
sovereign power, was compelled to fight. Otho continued to discharge his 
imperial duties as though it were a time of profound peace. Sometimes he 
consulted the dignity of the Commonwealth, but often in hasty acts, dictated 
by the expediency of the moment, he disregarded its honour. He was himself to be consul with his brother Titianus till the 1st of March; the two 
following months he assigned to Verginius as a compliment to the army of <placeName key="7000084">Germany</placeName>. With Verginius was to be associated Pompeius 
Vopiscus, avowedly on the ground of their being old friends, though many 
regarded the appointment as meant to do honour to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName>. The other consulships still remained as Nero or 
Galba had arranged them. C&aelig;lius Sabinus and his brother Flavius were 
to be consuls till the 1st of July; Arrius Antoninus and Marius Celsus from 
that time to the 1st of September. Even Vitellius, after his victory, did 
not interfere with these appointments. On aged citizens, who had already 
held high office, Otho bestowed, as a crowning dignity, pontificates and 
augurships, while he consoled the young nobles, who had lately returned from 
exile, by reviving the sacerdotal offices, held by their fathers

and ancestors. Cadius Rufus, Pedius Bl&aelig;sus, S&aelig;vinius 
Pomptinius, who in the reigns of Claudius and Nero had been convicted under 
indictments for extortion, were restored to their rank as Senators. Those 
who wished to pardon them resolved by a change of names to make, what had 
really been rapacity, seem to have been treason, a charge then so odious 
that it made even good laws a dead letter.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="78"><p>By similar bounty Otho sought to win the affections of the 
 cities and provinces. He bestowed on the colonies of <placeName key="tgn,7008676">Hispalis</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7007664">Emerita</placeName> some 
additional families, on the entire people of the <placeName key="tgn,7008343">Lingones</placeName> the privileges of 
  Roman citizenship; to the province of <placeName key="tgn,7002758">B&aelig;tica 
  </placeName>he joined the states of <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName>, and granted 
  to <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> new 
rights, more for display than for permanent utility. In the midst of these 
measures, which may find an excuse in the urgency of the crisis and the 
anxieties which pressed upon him, he still did not forget his old amours, 
and by a decree of the Senate restored the statues of Popp&aelig;a. It is 
even believed that he thought of celebrating the memory of Nero in the hope 
of winning the populace, and persons were found to exhibit statues of that 
Prince. There were days on which the people and the soldiers greeted him 
with shouts of Nero Otho, as if they were heaping on him new distinction and 
honour. Otho himself wavered in suspense, afraid to forbid or ashamed to 
acknowledge the title.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="79"><p>Men's minds 
were so intent on the civil war, that foreign affairs were disregarded. This 
emboldened the Roxolani, a Sarmatian tribe, who had destroyed two cohorts in 
the previous winter, to invade <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> with 
great hopes of success. They had 9000 cavalry, flushed with victory and 
intent on plunder rather than on fighting. They were dispersed and off their 
guard, when the third legion together with some auxiliaries attacked them. 
The Romans had everything ready for battle, the Sarmatians were scattered, 
and in their eagerness for plunder had encumbered themselves with heavy 
baggage, while the superior speed of their horses was lost on the slippery 
roads. Thus they were cut down as if their hands were tied. It is wonderful 
how entirely the courage of this people is, so to speak, external to 
themselves. No troops could shew so little spirit when fight-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">UPRISING OF SARMATIANS</note>
ing on foot; when they 
charge in squadrons, hardly any line can stand against them. But as on this 
occasion the day was damp and the ice thawed, what with the continual 
slipping of their horses, and the weight of their coats of mail, they could 
make no use of their pikes or their swords, which being of an excessive 
length they wield with both hands. These coats are worn as defensive armour 
by the princes and most distinguished persons of the tribe. They are formed 
of plates of iron or very tough hides, and though they are absolutely 
impenetrable to blows, yet they make it difficult for such as have been 
overthrown by the charge of the enemy to regain their feet. Besides, the 
Sarmatians were perpetually sinking in the deep and soft snow. The Roman 
soldier, moving easily in his cuirass, continued to harass them with 
javelins and lances, and whenever the occasion required, closed with them 
with his short sword, and stabbed the defenceless enemy; for it is not their 
custom to defend themselves with a shield. A few who survived the battle 
concealed themselves in the marshes. There they perished from the inclemency 
of the season and the severity of their wounds. When this success was known, 
Marcus Aponius, governor of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, was 
rewarded with a triumphal statue, while Fulvius Aurelius, Julianus Titius, 
and Numisius Lupus, the legates of the legions, received the ensigns of 
consular rank. Otho was delighted, and claimed the glory for himself, as if 
it were he that commanded success in war, and that had aggrandised the State 
by his generals and his armies.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="80"><p>Meanwhile, from a trifling cause, whence nothing was apprehended, there 
arose a tumult, which had nearly proved fatal to the capital. Otho had 
ordered the 17th cohort to be brought up to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> 
from <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName>, and the charge of arming it was 
entrusted to Varius Crispinus, one of the tribunes of the Pr&aelig;torian 
Guard. This officer, thinking that he could carry out the order more at his 
leisure, when the camp was quiet, opened the armoury, and ordered the 
waggons of the cohort to be laden at night-fall. The time provoked 
suspicion, the motive challenged accusation, the elaborate attempt at quiet 
ended in a disturbance, and the sight of arms among a drunken crowd excited 
the desire to use 

them. The soldiers murmured, and charged the 
tribunes and centurions with treachery, alleging that the households of the 
Senators were being armed to destroy Otho; many acted in ignorance and were 
stupefied by wine, the worst among them were seeking an opportunity for 
plunder, the mass was as usual ready for any new movement, and the military 
obedience of the better disposed was neutralised by the darkness. The 
tribune, who sought to check the movement, and the strictest disciplinarians 
among the centurions, were cut down. The soldiers seized their arms, bared 
their swords, and, mounted on their horses, made for the city and the 
palace.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="81"><p>Otho was giving a crowded 
entertainment to the most distinguished men and women of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. In their alarm they doubted whether this was a 
casual outbreak of the soldiers, or an act of treachery in the Emperor, and 
whether to remain and be arrested was a more perilous alternative than to 
disperse and fly. At one time making a show of courage, at another betrayed 
by their terror, they still watched the countenance of Otho. And, as it 
happened, so ready were all to suspect, Otho felt as much alarm as he 
inspired. Terrified no less by the Senate's critical position than by his 
own, he had forthwith despatched the prefects of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard 
to allay the fury of the soldiery, and he now ordered all to leave the 
banquet without delay. Then on all sides officers of state cast aside the 
insignia of office, and shunned the retinues of their friends and domestics; 
aged men and women wandered in the darkness of night about the various 
streets of the city; few went to their homes, most sought the houses of 
friends, or some obscure hiding-place in the dwelling of their humblest 
dependents.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="82"><p>The rush of the soldiers 
was not even checked by the doors of the palace. They burst in upon the 
banquet with loud demands that Otho should shew himself. They wounded the 
tribune, Julius Martialis, and the prefect, Vitellius Saturninus, who sought 
to stem the torrent. On every side they brandished their swords, and menaced 
the centurions and tribunes at one moment, the whole Senate at another. 
Their minds were maddened by a blind panic, and, unable to single out any 
one object for their fury, they

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">SOLDIERS RIOT AT 
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName></note>
sought for indiscriminate vengeance. At 
last Otho, regardless of his imperial dignity, stood up on a couch, and by 
dint of prayers and tears contrived to restrain them. Reluctant and guilty, 
they returned to the camp. The next day the houses were closed as they might 
be in a captured city. Few of the citizens could be seen in the streets, the 
populace were dejected, the soldiers walked with downcast looks, and seemed 
gloomy rather than penitent. Licinius Proculus and Plotius Firmus, the 
prefects, addressed the companies in the gentler or harsher terms that 
suited their respective characters. The end of these harangues was that 5000 
sesterces were paid to each soldier. Then did Otho venture to enter the 
camp; the tribunes and centurions surrounded him. They had thrown aside the 
insignia of their rank, and they demanded release from the toils and perils 
of service. The soldiers felt the reproach; returning to their duty, they 
even demanded the execution of the ringleaders in the riot.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="83"><p>Otho was aware how disturbed was the country, and 
how conflicting the feelings of the soldiery, the most respectable of whom 
cried out for some remedy for the existing licence, while the great mass 
delighted in riot and in an empire resting on popularity, and could be most 
easily urged to civil war by indulgence in tumult and rapine. At the same 
time he reflected that power acquired by crime could not be retained by a 
sudden assumption of the moderation and of the dignity of former times, yet 
he was alarmed by the critical position of the capital and by the perils of 
the Senate. Finally, he addressed the troops in these terms: "Comrades, I am 
not come that I may move your hearts to love me, or that I may rouse your 
courage; love and courage you have in superfluous abundance. I am come to 
pray you to put some restraint on your valour, some check on your affection 
for me. The origin of the late tumult is to be traced not to rapacity or 
disaffection, feelings which have driven many armies into civil strife, much 
less to any shrinking from, or fear of danger. It was your excessive 
affection for me that roused you to act with more zeal than discretion. For 
even honourable motives of action, unless directed by judgment, are followed 
by disastrous results. 

We are now starting for a campaign. Does 
the nature of things, does the rapid flight of opportunities, admit of all 
intelligence being publicly announced, of every plan being discussed in the 
presence of all? It is as needful that the soldiers should be ignorant of 
some things as that they should know others. The general's authority, the 
stern laws of discipline, require that in many matters even the centurions 
and tribunes shall only receive orders. If, whenever orders are given, 
individuals may ask questions, obedience ceases, and all command is at an 
end. Will you in the field too snatch up your arms in the dead of night? 
Shall one or two worthless and drunken fellows, for I cannot believe that 
more were carried away by the frenzy of the late outbreak, imbrue their 
hands in the blood of centurions and tribunes, and burst into the tent of 
their Emperor?</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="84"><p>"You indeed did this to 
serve me, but in the tumult, the darkness, and the general confusion, an 
opportunity may well occur that may be used against me. If Vitellius and his 
satellites were allowed to choose, what would be the temper and what the 
thoughts with which they would curse us? What would they wish for us but 
mutiny and strife, that the private should not obey the centurion, nor the 
centurion the tribune, that thus we should rush, horse and foot together, on 
our own destruction? Comrades, it is by obeying, not by questioning the 
orders of commanders, that military power is kept together. And that army is 
the most courageous in the moment of peril, which is the most orderly before 
the peril comes. Keep you your arms and your courage, leave it to me to 
plan, and to guide your valour. A few were in fault, two will be punished. 
Let all the rest blot out the remembrance of that night of infamy. Never let 
any army hear those cries against the Senate. To clamour for the destruction 
of what is the head of the Empire, and contains all that is distinguished in 
the provinces, good God! it is a thing which not even those Germans, whom 
Vitellius at this very moment is rousing against us, would dare to do. Shall 
any sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the true youth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, cry out for the massacre of an order, by whose 
splendid distinctions we throw into the shade the mean and obscure faction 
of Vitellius? Vitellius is the master of a few tribes,

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHO'S HARANGUE</note>
and has some semblance of an army. We have 
the Senate. The country is with us; with them, the country's enemies. What! 
do you imagine that this fairest of cities is made up of dwellings and 
edifices and piles of stones? These dumb and inanimate things may be 
indifferently destroyed and rebuilt. The eternal duration of empire, the 
peace of nations, my safety and yours, rest on the security of the Senate. 
This order which was instituted under due auspices by the Father and Founder 
of the city, and which has lasted without interruption and without decay 
from the Kings down to the Emperors, we will bequeath to our descendants, as 
we have inherited it from our ancestors. For you give the state its 
Senators, and the Senate gives it its Princes."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="85"><p>This speech, which was meant to touch and to calm the feelings 
of the soldiers, and the moderate amount of severity exercised (for Otho had 
ordered two and no more to be punished), met with a grateful acceptance, and 
for the moment reduced to order men who could not be coerced. Yet 
tranquillity was not restored to the capital; there was still the din of 
arms and all the sights of war, and the soldiers, though they made no 
concerted disturbance, had dispersed themselves in disguise about private 
houses, and exercised a malignant surveillance over all whom exalted rank, 
or distinction of any kind, exposed to injurious reports. Many too believed 
that some of the soldiers of Vitellius had come to the capital to learn the 
feelings of the different parties. Hence everything was rife with suspicion, 
and even the privacy of the family was hardly exempt from fear. It was 
however in public that most alarm was felt; with every piece of intelligence 
that rumour brought men changed their looks and spirits, anxious not to 
appear discouraged by unfavourable omens, or too little delighted by 
success. When the Senate was summoned to the Chamber, it was hard for them 
to maintain in all things a safe moderation. Silence might seem 
contumacious, and frankness might provoke suspicion, and Otho, who had 
lately been a subject, and had used the same language, was familiar with 
flattery. Accordingly, they discussed various motions on which they had put 
many constructions. Vitellius they called a public enemy and a traitor to 
his country, the more

prudent contenting themselves with 
hackneyed terms of abuse, though some threw out reproaches founded in truth, 
yet only did so in the midst of clamour, and when many voices were heard at 
once, drowning their own speech in a tumult of words.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="86"><p>Prodigies which were now noised abroad from various 
sources increased men's terror. It was said that in the porch of the Capitol 
the reins of the chariot, on which stood the goddess of Victory, had dropped 
from her hand, that from the chapel of Juno there had rushed forth a form 
greater than the form of man, that the statue of the Divine Julius, which 
stands on the island in the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, had turned from 
the West to the East on a calm and tranquil day, that an ox had spoken aloud 
in <placeName>Etruria</placeName>, that strange births of animals had taken 
place, besides many other things, such as in barbarous ages are observed 
even during seasons of peace, but are now heard of only in times of terror. 
But an alarm greater than all, because it connected immediate loss with 
fears for the future, arose from a sudden inundation of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>. The river became vastly swollen, broke down the 
wooden bridge, was checked by the heap of ruins across the current, and 
overflowed not only the low and level districts of the capital, but also 
much that had been thought safe from such casualties. Many were swept away 
in the streets, many more were cut off in their shops and chambers. The want 
of employment and the scarcity of provisions caused a famine among the 
populace. The poorer class of houses had their foundations sapped by the 
stagnant waters, and fell when the river returned to its channel. When men's 
minds were no longer occupied by their fears, the fact, that while Otho was 
preparing for his campaign, the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,6006327">Via Flaminia</placeName>, his 
route to the war, were obstructed by causes either fortuitous or natural, 
was regarded as a prodigy and an omen of impending disasters.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="87"><p><persName>Otho</persName>, after publicly purifying the city and 
 weighing various plans for the campaign, determined to march upon <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName>, as the passes of the Penine and <placeName>Cottian Alps</placeName> and all the other approaches to <placeName key="1000070">Gaul</placeName> were held by the armies of Vitellius. His fleet was 
strong and loyal to his

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">PRODIGIES; OTHO PREPARES 
FORCES</note>
cause, for he had enrolled in the ranks of the legion the 
survivors of the slaughter at the Milvian bridge, whom the stern policy of 
Galba had retained in custody, while to the rest he had held out hopes of a 
more honourable service for the future. To the fleet he had added some city 
cohorts, and many of the Pr&aelig;torians, the stay and strength of his 
army, who might at once advise and watch the generals. The command of the 
expedition was entrusted to Antonius Novellus and Suedius Clemens, 
centurions of the first rank, and &AElig;milius Pacensis, to whom <persName>Otho</persName> had 
restored the rank of tribune, taken from him by Galba. Oscus, a freedman, 
retained the charge of the fleet, and went to watch the fidelity of men more 
honourable than himself. Suetonius Paullinus, Marius Celsus, and Annius 
Gallus, were appointed to command the infantry and cavalry. The Emperor, 
however, placed most confidence in Licinius Proculus, prefect of the 
Pr&aelig;torian Guard; an active officer at home, without experience in war, 
he founded perpetual accusations on the high influence of Paullinus, on the 
energy of Celsus, on the mature judgment of Gallus, in fact, on each man's 
special excellence, a thing most easy to do; and thus the unscrupulous and 
the cunning were preferred before the modest and the good.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="88"><p>About this time Cornelius Dolabella was banished to 
the <placeName>Colonia Aquinas</placeName>, but he was not kept in strict 
or secret custody; it was not for any crime that he suffered; he was marked 
out for suspicion by his ancient name and by his relationship to Galba. Many 
of the officers of state and a large proportion of the men of consular rank 
<persName>Otho</persName> ordered to accompany him to the field, not indeed to share or serve in 
the campaign, but to form a retinue. Among them was Lucius Vitellius, whom 
Otho treated as he treated the rest, and not as though he were the brother 
either of an Emperor, or of an enemy. This roused the anxieties of the 
capital; no rank was free from apprehension or peril. The leading men of the 
Senate either suffered from the infirmities of age, or were enervated by a 
prolonged peace; the nobility were indolent and had forgotten how to fight; 
the Equestrian order knew nothing of service; and the more they endeavoured 
to hide and repress their alarm the more

evident was their 
terror. On the other hand, there were some who with senseless ostentation 
purchased splendid arms and magnificent horses, and some who procured by way 
of equipments for the war the luxurious furniture of the banquet and other 
incentives to profligacy. The wise looked to the interests of peace and of 
the Commonwealth, while the giddy and those who were thoughtless of the 
future were inflated with idle hopes. Many whose credit had been shaken in 
the years of peace regained their spirits amidst the confusions of the time, 
and found their best safety in revolution.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="89"><p>The mob and the people generally, whose vast numbers cut them 
off from all interest in the state, began by degrees to feel the evils of 
war, now that all the currency had been diverted to the purposes of the 
army, and the prices of provisions were raised. These evils had not equally 
distressed the common people during the insurrection of <persName>Vindex</persName>; the capital 
was safe, and the war was in the provinces, and, fought as it was between 
the legions and <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, it seemed but a foreign 
campaign. Indeed from the time that the Divine Augustus consolidated the 
power of the C&aelig;sars, the wars of the Roman people had been in remote 
places, and had caused anxiety or brought honour to but one man. Under 
<persName>Tiberius</persName> and Caius men dreaded for the Commonwealth only the miseries of 
peace. The rising of Scribonianus against Claudius was crushed as soon as 
heard of. <persName>Nero</persName> was driven from power by evil tidings and rumours rather than 
by the sword. Now the legions and the fleets were brought into action, and 
with them a force used but on few other occasions, the Pr&aelig;torian and 
city soldiery. In their rear were the provinces of the East and of the West 
with all their forces; had they fought under other generals there was all 
the material for a protracted war. Many suggested to <persName>Otho</persName>, as he was setting 
out, a religious obstacle in the fact that the sacred shields had not been 
restored to their place. He spurned all delay, as having been <persName>Nero</persName>'s fatal 
mistake; and the fact that C&aelig;cina had now crossed the Alps urged him to action.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="90"><p>On the 14th of March, after commending the State to the care of 
the Senate, he presented to those who had

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DISTRESS IN <placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName>; OTHO DEPARTS</note>
been 
recalled from exile what was left of the Neronian confiscations, or had not 
yet been paid into the Imperial treasury, a most equitable and apparently 
most splendid piece of liberality, but practically worthless, as the 
property had been hastily realized long before. Soon afterwards he summoned 
an assembly, and enlarged on the dignity of the capital and the unanimity of 
the Senate and people in his favour. Of the party of Vitellius he spoke with 
moderation, charging the legions with ignorance rather than with crime, and 
making no mention of Vitellius himself. This moderation was either his own, 
or was due to the writer of the speech, who, fearing for himself, abstained 
from invectives against Vitellius. For <persName>Otho</persName> was believed to avail himself of 
the abilities of Galerius Trachalus in civil matters, just as he employed 
those of Celsus and Paullinus in war. There were some who recognized the 
very style of speaking, which was well known from his constant pleading at 
the bar, and which sought to fill the popular ear with a copious and 
sonorous diction. The acclamations and cries which habitual flattery 
prompted in the people were at once extravagant and false. As if they were 
applauding a Dictator like C&aelig;sar, or an Emperor like Augustus, they 
vied with each other in their zeal and good wishes. They acted not from fear 
or affection, but from the mere love of servitude; as it might be in some 
private household, each had his own motives, and the public honour now went 
for nothing. <persName>Otho</persName> set out, leaving the peace of the city and the cares of 
empire in the charge of his brother Salvius Titianus.</p></div2></div1>

line. <persName>Titus</persName> Vespasian had been sent from <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> 
by his father while Galba still lived, and alleged as a reason for his 
journey the homage due to the Emperor, and his age, which now qualified him 
to compete for office. But the vulgar, ever eager to invent, had spread the 
report that he was sent for to be adopted. The advanced years and childless 
condition of the Emperor furnished matter for such gossip, and the country 
never can refrain from naming many persons until one be chosen. The report 
gained the more credit from the genius of Titus himself, equal as it was to 
the most exalted fortune, from the mingled beauty and majesty of his 
countenance, from the prosperous fortunes of Vespasian, from the prophetic 
responses of oracles, and even from accidental occurrences which, in the 
general disposition to belief, were accepted as omens. At <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, the capital of <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, 
he received positive information of the death of Galba, and found men who 
spoke confidently of the revolt of Vitellius and of the fact of war. In the 
anxiety of his mind, he sent for a few of his friends, and carefully 
surveyed his position from both points of view. He considered that if he 
should proceed to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he should get no thanks for 
a civility intended for another, while his person would be a hostage in the 
hands either of Vitellius or of <persName>Otho</persName>; that should he turn back, the 
conqueror would certainly be offended, but with the issue of the struggle 
still doubtful, and the father joining the party, the son would be excused; 
on the other hand, if Vespasian should assume the direc-

tion of the 
state, men who had to think of war would have to forget such causes of 
offence.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>These and like thoughts made 
him waver between hope and fear; but hope triumphed. Some supposed that he 
retraced his steps for love of Queen Berenice, nor was his young heart 
averse to her charms, but this affection occasioned no hindrance to action. 
He passed, it is true, a youth enlivened by pleasure, and practised more 
self-restraint in his own than in his father's reign. So, after coasting <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, leaving the 
 land on his left, he made for the islands of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> 
 and <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, and then by a bolder course for <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. Here he conceived a desire to visit and inspect 
the temple of the Paphian Venus, a place of celebrity both among natives and 
foreigners. It will not be a tedious digression to record briefly the origin 
of the worship, the ceremonial of the temple, and the form under which the 
goddess is adored, a form found in no other place.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>The founder of the temple, according to old 
tradition, was king Aerias, though some represent this as the name of the 
goddess herself. Later accounts tell us that the temple was consecrated by 
Cinyras, and that the goddess herself after her birth from the sea was 
wafted to this spot, but that the wisdom and craft of the diviners was a 
foreign importation introduced by Tamiras of <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>; and that it was agreed that the descendants of 
both families should preside over the worship. Afterwards, that the royal 
family might not be without some superiority over the foreign stock, the 
strangers relinquished the craft which they had themselves introduced. The 
priest of the line of Cinyras is alone consulted. The victims are such as 
each worshipper has vowed, but males are selected; the surest prognostics 
are seen in the entrails of kids. It is forbidden to pour blood on the 
altar; the place of sacrifice is served only with prayers and pure flame, 
and though it stands in the open air, it is never wet with rain. The image 
of the goddess does not bear the human shape; it is a rounded mass rising 
like a cone from a broad base to a small circumference. The meaning of this 
is doubtful.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p><persName>Titus</persName>, after surveying the 
treasures, the royal presents, and the other objects which the antiquarian 
tendencies of

the Greek arbitrarily connect with some uncertain 
past, first consulted the oracle about his voyage. Receiving an answer that 
the way was open and the sea propitious, he then, after sacrificing a number 
of victims, asked some questions in ambiguous phrase concerning himself. 
Sostratus (that was the name of the priest) seeing that the entrails 
presented an uniformly favourable appearance, and that the goddess signified 
her favour to some great enterprise, returned at the moment a brief and 
ordinary answer, but afterwards soliciting a private interview, disclosed 
the future. His spirits raised, <persName>Titus</persName> rejoined his father, and was received 
as a mighty pledge of success by the wavering minds of the provincials and 
the troops. Vespasian had all but completed the Jewish war, and only the 
siege of <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Jerusalem</placeName> now remained, an operation, the 
difficulty and arduousness of which was due, rather to the character of its 
mountain citadel and the perverse obstinacy of the national superstition, 
than to any sufficient means of enduring extremities left to the besieged. 
As we have mentioned above, Vespasian himself had three legions inured to 
war. Mucianus had four under his command in his peaceful province. 
Emulation, however, and the glory won by the neighbouring army had banished 
all tendency to sloth, and unbroken rest and exemption from the hardships of 
war had given them a vigour equivalent to the hardihood which the others had 
gained by their perils and their toils. Each had auxiliary forces of 
infantry and cavalry, each had fleets and tributary kings, and each, though 
their renown was of a different kind, had a celebrated name.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>Vespasian was an energetic soldier; he could march at 
the head of his army, choose the place for his camp, and bring by night and 
day his skill, or, if the occasion required, his personal courage to oppose 
the foe. His food was such as chance offered; his dress and appearance 
hardly distinguished him from the common soldier; in short, but for his 
avarice, he was equal to the generals of old. Mucianus, on the contrary, was 
eminent for his magnificence, for his wealth, and for a greatness that 
transcended in all respects the condition of a subject; readier of speech 
than the other, he thoroughly understood the arrangement and

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VESPASIAN'S POSITION</note>
direction of civil 
business. It would have been a rare combination of princely qualities, if, 
with their respective faults removed, their virtues only could have been 
united in one man. Mucianus was governor of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, 
 Vespasian of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>. In the administration of 
these neighbouring provinces jealousy had produced discord between them, but 
on <persName>Nero</persName>'s fall they had dropped their animosities and associated their 
counsels. At first they communicated through friends, till <persName>Titus</persName>, who was 
the great bond of union between them, by representing their common interests 
had terminated their mischievous feud. He was indeed a man formed both by 
nature and by education to attract even such a character as that of 
Mucianus. The tribunes, the centurions, and the common soldiers, were 
brought over to the cause by appeals to their energy or their love of 
license, to their virtues or to their vices, according to their different 
dispositions.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>Long before the arrival 
of Titus, both armies had taken the oath of allegiance to <persName>Otho</persName>. The news had 
come, as is usual, with great speed, while there was much to delay the 
gigantic undertaking of a civil war, for which the East after a long period 
of repose was then for the first time preparing. In former times the 
mightiest civil conflicts had been begun in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> or 
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with the resources of the West. Pompey, 
<persName>Brutus</persName>, Cassius, and Antony, all of whom had been followed across the sea by 
civil war, had met with a disastrous end, and the Emperors had been oftener 
heard of than seen in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>. There had been no mutiny among the legions, 
nothing indeed but some demonstrations against the Parthians, attended with 
various success. In the last civil war, though other provinces had been 
disturbed, peace had been here unshaken. Then had followed a loyal adherence 
to Galba. But when it became notorious that <persName>Otho</persName> and Vitellius, opposed in 
impious strife, were ready to make a spoil of the Empire, the thought that 
others would engross the rewards of power, while they would have nothing 
left for themselves but a compulsory submission, made the soldiers murmur 
and take a survey of their own strength. There were close at hand seven 
legions; there were <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>, with a vast number of auxiliaries. Then, 
 without any interval of separation, there was <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> 
and its

 two legions, and on the other side <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, and all the 
  garrisons along the frontier of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>. There was 
  <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName>; there were the other provinces, not 
without a military population, and well furnished with money. There were all 
the islands of the <placeName key="tgn,7016735">Mediterranean</placeName>. And there was the 
sea itself, which during the interval of preparation for war would be both a 
convenience and a protection.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>The 
ardour of the troops was not unknown to their generals; but it was judged 
advisable to wait for the issue of the struggle which others were carrying 
on. The conquerors and the conquered, it was said, never unite with a 
genuine good faith. It matters not whether fortune make <persName>Otho</persName> or Vitellius to 
be the victor. Even great generals grow insolent in prosperity; these men 
are quarrelsome, indolent and profligate, and their own faults will make war 
fatal to the one, and success to the other. They therefore postponed the war 
until a more fitting opportunity, and though Vespasian and Mucianus had but 
lately resolved on concerted action, the others had done so long before. The 
worthiest among them were moved by patriotism; many were wrought upon by the 
attractions of plunder; some by their private embarrassments. And so, good 
and bad, from different motives, but with equal zeal, were all eager for 
war.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>About this time <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> were 
terrified by a false report that <persName>Nero</persName> was at hand. Various rumours were 
current about his death; and so there were many who pretended and believed 
that he was still alive. The adventures and enterprises of the other 
pretenders I shall relate in the regular course of my work. The pretender in 
this case was a slave from <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, or, according to 
some accounts, a freedman from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, a skilful 
harp-player and singer, accomplishments, which, added to a resemblance in 
the face, gave a very deceptive plausibility to his pretensions. After 
attaching to himself some deserters, needy vagrants whom he bribed with 
great offers, he put to sea. Driven by stress of weather to the island of 
  <placeName key="tgn,1042044">Cythnus</placeName>, he induced certain soldiers, who were on 
their way from the East, to join him, and ordered others, who refused, to be 
executed. He also robbed the traders and armed all the most able-bodied of 
the slaves. The centurion Sisenna, who was the bearer of the

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">THE FALSE NERO</note>
clasped right hands, the usual 
emblems of friendship, from the armies of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> to 
the Pr&aelig;torians, was assailed by him with various artifices, till he 
left the island secretly, and, fearing actual violence, made his escape with 
all haste. Thence the alarm spread far and wide, and many roused themselves 
at the well-known name, eager for change, and detesting the present state of 
things. The report was daily gaining credit when an accident put an end to 
it.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Galba had entrusted the government 
 of <placeName key="tgn,7016662">Galatia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName> to 
Calpurnius Asprenas. Two triremes from the fleet of <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName> were given him to pursue the adventurer: with 
  these he reached the island of <placeName key="tgn,1042044">Cythnus</placeName>. Persons were 
found to summon the captains in the name of <persName>Nero</persName>. The pretender himself, 
assuming a studied appearance of sorrow, and appealing to their fidelity as 
old soldiers of his own, besought them to land him in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. The captains, 
perhaps wavering, perhaps intending to deceive, declared that they must 
address their soldiers, and that they would return when the minds of all had 
been prepared. Every thing, however, was faithfully reported to Asprenas, 
and at his bidding the ship was boarded and taken, and the man, whoever he 
was, killed. The body, in which the eyes, the hair, and the savage 
countenance, were remarkable features, was conveyed to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and thence to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>In a state that was distracted by strife, 
and that from frequent changes in its rulers trembled on the verge between 
liberty and licence, even little matters were attended with great 
excitement. Vibius Crispus, whose wealth, power, and ability, made him rank 
among men of distinction, rather than among men of worth, demanded that 
Annius Faustus, of the Equestrian order, who in the days of <persName>Nero</persName> had 
practised the trade of the informer, should be brought to trial before the 
Senate. The Senators indeed had recently, during the reign of Galba, passed 
a resolution, that cognizance should be taken of the cases of the informers. 
This decree was variously carried out, and, while retained as law, was 
powerless or effectual, according as the person, who happened to be accused, 
was influential or helpless. Besides the terror of the law, Crispus had 
exerted his own power to the utmost to destroy the man who had informed 
against his

brother. He had prevailed upon a great part of the 
Senate to demand that he should be consigned to destruction, undefended and 
unheard. But, on the other hand, there were some with whom nothing helped 
the accused person so much as the excessive power of the accuser. They gave 
it as their opinion, that time ought to be allowed, that the charges ought 
to be specified, that, odious and guilty as the man might be, he yet ought 
to be heard, as precedent required. At first they carried their point, and 
the trial was postponed for a few days, but before long Faustus was 
condemned, but by no means with that unanimity on the part of the people 
which his detestable character had deserved. Men remembered that Crispus had 
followed the same profession with profit; nor was it the penalty but the 
prosecutor that they disliked.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>Meanwhile the campaign had opened favourably for <persName>Otho</persName>, at whose bidding the 
 armies of <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName> had begun to move. These comprised four legions 
from each of which two thousand troops were sent on in advance. The 7th had 
been raised by Galba, the 11th, 13th, and 14th were veteran soldiers, the 
14th having particularly distinguished itself by quelling the revolt in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. <persName>Nero</persName> had added to their reputation by selecting 
them as his most effective troops. This had made them long faithful to <persName>Nero</persName>, 
and kindled their zeal for <persName>Otho</persName>. But their self-confidence induced a 
tardiness of movement proportionate to their strength and solidity. The 
auxiliary infantry and cavalry moved in advance of the main body of the 
legions. The capital itself contributed no contemptible force, namely five 
Pr&aelig;torian cohorts, some troops of cavalry, and the first legion, and 
together with these, 2000 gladiators, a disreputable kind of auxiliaries, 
but employed throughout the civil wars even by strict disciplinarians. 
Annius Gallus was put at the head of this force, and was sent on with 
Vestricius Spurinna to occupy the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus,</placeName> the original plan of the campaign having fallen 
to the ground, now that C&aelig;cina, who they had hoped might have been 
kept within the limits of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, had crossed the <placeName>Alps</placeName>. <persName>Otho</persName> himself was accompanied by some picked men of 
the body-guard, with whom were the rest of the Pr&aelig;torian cohorts, the 
veteran 

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHO'S VIGOROUS ACTION</note>
troops 
from the Pr&aelig;torian camp, and a vast number of the levies raised from 
the fleet. No indolence or riot disgraced his march. He wore a cuirass of 
iron, and was to be seen in front of the standards, on foot, rough and 
negligent in dress, and utterly unlike what common report had pictured 
him.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>Fortune seemed to smile on his 
efforts. Through his fleets, which commanded the sea, he held the greater 
part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, even as far as where the chain of the 
 <placeName key="tgn,1109327">Maritime Alps</placeName> begins. The task of attempting the 
 passage of this chain, and of advancing into the <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Provincia Narbonensis</placeName>, he had entrusted to three 
generals, Suedius Clemens, Antonius Novellus, and &AElig;milius Pacensis. 
Pacensis, however, was put in irons by his insubordinate troops, Antonius 
possessed no kind of authority, and Clemens commanded only for popularity, 
and was as reckless in transgressing the good order of military discipline 
as he was eager to fight. One would not have thought that it was <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the fields, and the habitations of their native 
country, that they were passing through. They burnt, spoiled, and plundered, 
as if they were among the lands of the foreigner and the cities of a hostile 
people, and all with the more frightful effect as nowhere had there been 
made any provision against the danger. The fields were full of rural wealth, 
the houses stood with open doors; and the owners, as with their wives and 
children they came forth to meet the army, found themselves surrounded, in 
the midst of the security of peace, with all the horrors of war. Marius 
Maturus was then governing as procurator the province of the <placeName key="tgn,1109327">Maritime Alps</placeName>. Raising the population, in which is no 
lack of able-bodied men, he resolved to drive back the Othonianists from the 
borders of his province; but the mountaineers were cut down and broken by 
the first charge, as might be expected of men who had been hastily 
collected, who were not familiar with camps or with regular command, who saw 
no glory in victory, no infamy in flight.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>Exasperated by this conflict, the troops of <persName>Otho</persName> vented their 
 rage on the town of <placeName key="tgn,7005355">Albintemilium</placeName>. In the field 
indeed they had secured no plunder; their rustic adversaries were poor, and 
their arms worthless; nor could they

be taken prisoners, for they 
were swift of foot, and knew the country well. But the rapacity of the 
troops glutted itself in the ruin of an innocent population. The horror of 
these acts was aggravated by a noble display of fortitude in a Ligurian 
woman; she had concealed her son, and when the soldiers, who believed that 
some money had been hidden with him, questioned her with torture as to where 
she was hiding him, she pointed to her bosom, and replied, "It is here that 
he is concealed;" nor could any subsequent threats or even death itself make 
her falter in this courageous and noble answer.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>Messengers now came in haste and alarm to inform Fabius Valens, 
 how <persName>Otho</persName>'s fleet was threatening the province of <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia 
Narbonensis</placeName>, which had sworn allegiance to Vitellius. Envoys from the 
colonies were already on the spot praying for aid. He despatched two cohorts 
of Tungrian infantry, four squadrons of horse, and all the cavalry of the 
Treviri under the command of Julius Classicus. Part of these troops were 
retained for the defence of the colony of <placeName key="perseus,Forum Julii">Forum 
Julii</placeName>, for it was feared, that if the whole army were sent by the route 
through the interior, the enemy's fleet might make a rapid movement on the 
unprotected coast. Twelve squadrons of cavalry and some picked infantry 
advanced against the enemy; they were reinforced by a cohort of Ligurians, 
an auxiliary local force of long standing, and five hundred Pannonians, not 
yet regularly enrolled. The conflict commenced without delay, the enemy's 
line of battle being so arranged, that part of the levies from the fleet, 
who had a number of rustics among their ranks, were posted on the slope of 
the hills which border on the coast, the Pr&aelig;torians fully occupying 
the level ground between the hills and the shore, while on the sea was the 
fleet, moored to the land and ready for action, drawn up in line so as to 
present a formidable front. The Vitellianists whose infantry was inferior, 
but who were strong in cavalry, stationed the mountaineers on the 
neighbouring heights, and their infantry in close ranks behind the cavalry. 
The squadrons of the Treveri charged the enemy incautiously, and found 
themselves encountered in front by the veteran troops, while on the flanks 
they were also an-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIANISTS 
DEFEATED</note>
noyed by showers of stones from the rustic band, who were 
skilful throwers, and who, mixed up as they were among the regular soldiers, 
whether cowardly or brave, were all equally bold in the moment of victory. 
The general consternation of the Vitellianists was increased by a new alarm 
as the fleet attacked the rear of the combatants. By this movement they were 
hemmed in on all sides, and the whole force would have perished, had not the 
shades of night checked the advance of the victorious army, and covered the 
retreat of the vanquished.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>The 
Vitellianists, however, though beaten, did not remain inactive. They brought 
up reinforcements and attacked the enemy, who felt themselves secure, and 
whose vigilance was relaxed by success. The sentinels were cut down, the 
camp stormed, and the panic reached the ships, till, as the alarm gradually 
subsided, they again assumed the offensive under the protection of some 
neighbouring heights which they had occupied. A terrible slaughter ensued, 
and the prefects of the Tungrian cohorts, after having long maintained their 
line unbroken, fell beneath a shower of missiles. The Othonianists, however, 
did not achieve a bloodless victory, as the enemy's cavalry wheeled round, 
and cut off some who had imprudently prolonged the pursuit. And then, as if 
a sort of armistice had been concluded to provide against any sudden panic 
that the cavalry of the one party or the fleet of the other might cause, the 
Vitellianists retreated to <placeName key="tgn,7012323">Antipolis</placeName>, a town of <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName>, the Othonianists to <placeName key="tgn,7005379">Albigaunum</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7003236">Upper

islands of the neighbouring seas, were retained in the interests of <persName>Otho</persName> by 
  the fame of these naval successes. <placeName key="tgn,7001093">Corsica</placeName>, however, 
all but suffered fatal injury from the rash proceedings of Decumus Pacarius, 
the procurator, proceedings which in so gigantic a war could contribute 
nothing to the general result, and which only brought destruction upon their 
author. In his hatred of <persName>Otho</persName> he resolved to support Vitellius with the 
  whole strength of <placeName key="tgn,7001093">Corsica</placeName>, an insignificant 
assistance even had the design succeeded. He collected the chief men of the 
island, and explained his plans. Claudius Pyrrhicus, captain of the 
Liburnian ships stationed in the place, and Quintius

Certus, a 
Roman knight, who ventured to offer opposition, he ordered to execution. All 
who were present were terrified at their death, and, with the ignorant 
populace, which ever blindly shares in the fears of others, took the oath of 
allegiance to Vitellius. But when Pacarius began to enlist troops, and to 
weary with military duties an undisciplined population, disgusted with the 
unusual toil, they began to reflect upon their own weakness. "The country 
which we inhabit," they said to themselves, "is an island: <placeName key="7000084">Germany</placeName> and its mighty legions are far from us, and we 
know that even countries protected by infantry and cavalry have been 
plundered and ravaged by the fleet." Their feelings underwent a sudden 
change; they did not, however, resort to open violence, but chose an 
opportunity for a treacherous attack. When the persons who usually 
surrounded Pacarius had left him, and he was naked and helpless in the bath 
they slew him. His associates were slaughtered with him. The perpetrators of 
the deed carried the heads of the slain to <persName>Otho</persName>, as being the heads of 
public enemies; but, lost among the crowd of greater criminals, in the vast 
confusion of events, they were neither rewarded by <persName>Otho</persName> nor punished by 
Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>Silius' Horse had now, as 
I have already related, opened the way into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, 
and transferred the war across the borders. No one entertained any 
attachment to <persName>Otho</persName>, yet it was not because they preferred Vitellius: long 
years of peace had subdued them to any kind of servitude, had made them 
ready to submit to the first comer and careless about the better cause. The

 cities which lie between the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> and the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, was now held by the troops of Vitellius; for by

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIANIST 
SUCCESSES</note>
and seizing some reconnoiterers so terrified the rest, 
that, deceived by their alarm, they announced that the whole army of 
C&aelig;cina was at hand.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>Spurinna, 
who now held <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>, was sure that C&aelig;cina 
had not yet arrived, and that, even were he approaching, he ought to keep 
his men within their fortifications, and not confront a veteran army with 
three Pr&aelig;torian cohorts, a thousand veterans, and a handful of 
cavalry. But the undisciplined and inexperienced soldiery seized their 
standards and colours, and rushed to the attack, brandishing their weapons 
in the face of their general when he sought to restrain them, and spurning 
from them the tribunes and centurions, and even crying out that <persName>Otho</persName> was 
betrayed and that C&aelig;cina had come by invitation. Spurinna associated 
himself with the rash movement which others had originated, at first acting 
under compulsion, but afterwards pretending to consent, in the hope that his 
counsels might have more influence should the mutinous spirit abate.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>When the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> was 
in sight and night began to fall they judged it expedient to entrench a 
camp. The labour, new as it was to the soldiery of the capital, broke their 
spirits. All the oldest among them began to inveigh against their own 
credulity, and to point out the difficulty and danger of their position, if 
on those open plains C&aelig;cina and his army were to surround their scanty 
forces. By this time more temperate language was heard throughout the camp, 
and the tribunes and centurions, mixing with the troops, suggested 
commendations of the prudence of their general in selecting for the rallying 
point and basis of his operations a colony rich in military strength and 
resources. Finally, Spurinna himself, not so much reproaching them with 
their error as exposing it by his arguments, conducted them all back to <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>, except some scouts whom he left, in a less 
turbulent temper and more amenable to command. The walls were strengthened, 
battlements were added, and the towers were raised in height. It was not 
only of the implements of war that provision and preparation were made, but 
of the spirit of subordination and the love of obedience. This was all that 
was wanting to the party, for they had no reason to be dissatisfied with 
their courage.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>C&aelig;cina, who seemed to have left his cruelty and profligacy on the 
other side of the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, advanced through <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with his army under excellent discipline. The 
towns and colonies, however, found indications of a haughty spirit in the 
general's dress, when they saw the cloak of various colours, and the trews, 
a garment of foreign fashion, clothed in which he was wont to speak to their 
toga-clad citizens. And they resented, as if with a sense of personal wrong, 
the conduct of his wife Salonina, though it injured no one that she 
presented a conspicuous figure as she rode through their towns on horseback 
in a purple habit. They were acting on the instincts of human nature, which 
prompt men to scrutinize with keen eyes the recent elevation of their 
fellows, and to demand a temperate use of prosperity from none more 
rigorously than from those whom they have seen on a level with themselves. 
C&aelig;cina, after crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, sought to 
tamper with the loyalty of the Othonianists at a conference in which he held 
out hopes of reward, and he was himself assailed with the same arts. After 
the specious but meaningless names of peace and concord had been thus 
bandied to and fro, C&aelig;cina turned all his thoughts and plans on the 
capture of <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>, making a formidable show of 
preparation, as he knew that according to the success of his opening 
operations would be the subsequent prestige of his arms.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>The first day, however, was spent in a furious 
onset rather than in the skilful approaches of a veteran army. Exposed and 
reckless, the troops came close under the walls stupefied by excess in food 
and wine. In this struggle the amphitheatre, a most beautiful building, 
situated outside the Walls, was burnt to the ground, possibly set on fire by 
the assailants, while they showered brands, fireballs, and ignited missiles, 
on the besieged, possibly by the besieged themselves, while they discharged 
incessant volleys in return. The populace of the town, always inclined to be 
suspicious, believed that combustibles had been purposely introduced into 
the building by certain persons from the neighbouring colonies, who viewed 
it with envious and jealous eyes, because there was not in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> another building so capacious. Whatever the cause 
of the accident, it was thought of but

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">C&AElig;CINA FAILS AT <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">PLACENTIA</placeName></note>
little moment as long as more terrible 
disasters were apprehended; but as soon as they again felt secure, they 
lamented it as though they could not have endured a heavier calamity. In the 
end C&aelig;cina was repulsed with great slaughter among his troops, and the 
night was spent in the preparation of siege-works. The Vitellianists 
constructed mantlets, hurdles, and sheds, for undermining the walls and 
screening the assailants; the Othonianists busied themselves in preparing 
stakes and huge masses of stone and of lead and brass, with which to break 
and overwhelm the hostile ranks. The shame of failure, the hope of renown, 
wrought on both armies; both were appealed to by different arguments; on the 
one side they extolled the strength of the legions and of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; on the other, the distinctions of the soldiery 
of the capital and the Pr&aelig;torian cohorts; the one reviled their foes 
as slothful and indolent soldiers, demoralized by the circus and the 
theatres; the others retorted with the names of foreigner and barbarian. At 
the same time they lauded or vituperated <persName>Otho</persName> and Vitellius, but found 
indeed a more fruitful source of mutual provocation in invective than in 
praise.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>Almost before dawn of day the 
walls were crowded with combatants, and the plains glittered with masses of 
armed men. The close array of the legions, and the skirmishing parties of 
auxiliaries assailed with showers of arrows and stones the loftier parts of 
the walls, attacking them at close quarters, where they were undefended, or 
old and decayed. The Othonianists, who could take a more deliberate and 
certain aim, poured down their javelins on the German cohorts as they 
recklessly advanced to the attack with fierce war-cries, brandishing their 
shields above their shoulders after the manner of their country, and leaving 
their bodies unprotected. The soldiers of the legions, working under cover 
of mantlets and hurdles, undermined the walls, threw up earth-works, and 
endeavoured to burst open the gates. The Pr&aelig;torians opposed them by 
rolling down with a tremendous crash ponderous masses of rock, placed for 
the purpose. Beneath these many of the assailants were buried, and many, as 
the slaughter increased with the confusion, and the attack from the walls 
became fiercer, re-

treated wounded, fainting, and mangled, with 
serious damage to the prestige of the party. C&aelig;cina, ashamed of the 
assault on which he had so rashly ventured, and unwilling, ridiculed and 
baffled as he was, to remain in the same position, again crossed the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, and resolved on marching to <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. As he was going, Turullius Cerialis with a 
great number of the levies from the fleet, and Julius Briganticus with a few 
troopers, gave themselves up to him. Julius commanded a squadron of horse; 
he was a Batavian. Turullius was a centurion of the first rank, not 
unfriendly to C&aelig;cina, as he had commanded a company in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>Spurinna, on discovering the enemy's route, informed Annius Gallus by letter 
of the successful defence of <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>, of what had 
happened, and of what C&aelig;cina intended to do. Gallus was then bringing 
up the first legion to the relief of <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>; he 
hardly dared trust so few cohorts, fearing that they could not sustain a 
prolonged siege or the formidable attack of the German army. On hearing that 
C&aelig;cina had been repulsed, and was making his way to <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, though the legion could hardly be restrained, 
and in its eagerness for action, even went to the length of open mutiny, he 
halted at <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>. This is a village situated 
between <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, 
and has now acquired an ill-omened celebrity by two great days of disaster 
to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. About the same time Martius Macer fought a 
successful battle not far from <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. Martius, who 
 was a man of energy, conveyed his gladiators in boats across the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, and suddenly threw them upon the opposite bank. 
The Vitellianist auxiliaries on the spot were routed; those who made a stand 
were cut to pieces, the rest directing their flight to <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. But the impetuosity of the victors was checked; 
for it was feared that the enemy might be strengthened by reinforcements, 
and change the fortune of the day. This policy excited the suspicions of the 
Othonianists, who put a sinister construction on all the acts of their 
generals. Vying with each other in an insolence of language proportioned to 
their cowardice of heart, they assailed with various accusations Annius 
Gallus, Suetonius Paullinus, and Marius Celsus. The murderers of Galba were 
the most ardent promoters of mutiny and discord. Frenzied 

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHONIASTS VICTORS AT <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">CREMONA</placeName></note>
with 
fear and guilt, they sought to plunge everything into confusion, resorting, 
now to openly seditious language, now to secret letters to <persName>Otho</persName>; and he, 
ever ready to believe the meanest of men and suspicious of the good, 
irresolute in prosperity, but rising higher under reverses, was in perpetual 
alarm. The end of it was that he sent for his brother Titianus, and 
intrusted him with the direction of the campaign.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>Meanwhile, brilliant successes were gained under the command of 
Celsus and Paullinus. C&aelig;cina was greatly annoyed by the fruitlessness 
of all his undertakings, and by the waning reputation of his army. He had 
been repulsed from <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>; his auxiliaries had 
been recently cut up, and even when the skirmishers had met in a series of 
actions, frequent indeed, but not worth relating, he had been worsted; and 
now that Valens was coming up, fearful that all the distinctions of the 
campaign would centre in that general, he made a hasty attempt to retrieve 
his credit, but with more impetuosity than prudence. Twelve miles from <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> (at a place called the Castors) he posted some 
of the bravest of his auxiliaries, concealed in the woods that there 
overhang the road. The cavalry were ordered to move forward, and, after 
provoking a battle, voluntarily to retreat, and draw on the enemy in hasty 
pursuit, till the ambuscade could make a simultaneous attack. The scheme was 
betrayed to the Othonianist generals, and Paullinus assumed the command of 
the infantry, Celsus of the cavalry. The veterans of the 13th legion, four 
cohorts of auxiliaries, and 500 cavalry, were drawn up on the left side of 
the road; the raised causeway was occupied by three Pr&aelig;torian cohorts, 
ranged in deep columns; on the right front stood the first legion with two 
cohorts of auxiliaries and 500 cavalry. Besides these, a thousand cavalry, 
belonging to the Pr&aelig;torian guard and to the auxiliaries, were brought 
up to complete a victory or to retrieve a repulse.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>Before the hostile lines engaged, the Vitellianists 
began to retreat, but Celsus, aware of the stratagem, kept his men back. The 
Vitellianists rashly left their position, and seeing Celsus gradually give 
way, followed too far in pursuit, and themselves fell into an ambuscade. The 
auxiliaries

assailed them on either flank, the legions were 
opposed to them in front, and the cavalry, by a sudden movement, had 
surrounded their rear. Suetonius Paullinus did not at once give the infantry 
the signal to engage. He was a man naturally tardy in action, and one who 
preferred a cautious and scientific plan of operations to any success which 
was the result of accident. He ordered the trenches to be filled up, the 
plain to be cleared, and the line to be extended, holding that it would be 
time enough to begin his victory when he had provided against being 
vanquished. This delay gave the Vitellianists time to retreat into some 
vineyards, which were obstructed by the interlacing layers of the vines, and 
close to which was a small wood. From this place they again ventured to 
emerge, slaughtering the foremost of the Pr&aelig;torian cavalry. King 
Epiphanes was wounded, while he was zealously cheering on the troops for 
<persName>Otho</persName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>Then the Othonianist infantry 
charged. The enemy's line was completely crushed, and the reinforcements who 
were coming up to their aid were also put to flight. C&aelig;cina indeed had 
not brought up his cohorts in a body, but one by one; as this was done 
during the battle, it increased the general confusion, because the troops 
who were thus divided, not being strong at any one point, were borne away by 
the panic of the fugitives. Besides this, a mutiny broke out in the camp 
because the whole army was not led into action. Julius Gratus, prefect of 
the camp, was put in irons, on a suspicion of a treacherous understanding 
with his brother who was serving with <persName>Otho</persName>'s army, at the very time that the 
Othonianists had done the same thing and on the same grounds to that brother 
Julius Fronto, a tribune. In fact such was the panic everywhere, among the 
fugitives and among the troops coming up, in the lines and in front of the 
entrenchments, that it was very commonly said on both sides, that 
C&aelig;cina and his whole army might have been destroyed, had not Suetonius 
Paullinus given the signal of recall. Paullinus alleged that he feared the 
effects of so much additional toil and so long a march, apprehending that 
the Vitellianists might issue fresh from their camp, and attack his wearied 
troops, who, once thrown into confusion, would have no reserves to fall back 
upon. A few ap-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">SALUTARY VITELLIANIST 
DEFEAT</note>
proved the general's policy, but it was unfavourably canvassed 
by the army at large.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>The effect of 
this disaster on the Vitellianists was not so much to drive them to fear as 
to draw them to obedience. Nor was this the case only among the troops of 
C&aelig;cina, who indeed laid all the blame upon his soldiers, more ready, 
as he said, for mutiny than for battle. The forces also of Fabius Valens, 
who had now reached <placeName key="tgn,7006026">Ticinum</placeName>, laid aside their 
contempt for the enemy, and anxious to retrieve their credit began to yield 
a more respectful and uniform obedience to their general. A serious mutiny, 
however, had raged among them, of which, as it was not convenient to 
interrupt the orderly narrative of C&aelig;cina's operations, I shall take 
up the history at an earlier period. I have already described how the 
Batavian cohorts who separated from the 14th legion during the Neronian war, 
hearing on their way to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> of the rising of 
Vitellius, joined Fabius Valens in the country of the <placeName key="tgn,7008343">Lingones</placeName>. They behaved 
themselves insolently, boasting, as they visited the quarters of the several 
legions, that they had mastered the men of the 14th, that they had taken <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> from <persName>Nero</persName>, that the whole destiny of the war lay 
in their hands. Such language was insulting to the soldiers, and offensive 
to the general. The discipline of the army was relaxed by the brawls and 
quarrels which ensued. At last Valens began to suspect that insolence would 
end in actual treachery.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>When, 
therefore, intelligence reached him that the cavalry of the Treveri and the 
Tungrian infantry had been defeated by <persName>Otho</persName>'s fleet, and that <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName> was blockaded, anxious at once to 
protect a friendly population, and, like a skilful soldier, to separate 
cohorts so turbulent and, while they remained united, so inconveniently 
strong, he directed a detachment of the Batavians to proceed to the relief 
of the province. This having been heard and become generally known, the 
allies were discontented and the legions murmured. "We are being deprived," 
they said, "of the help of our bravest men. Those veteran troops victorious 
in so many campaigns, now that the enemy is in sight, are withdrawn, so to 
speak, from the very field of battle. If indeed a province be of more 
importance than the capital

and the safety of the Empire, let us 
all follow them thither, but if the reality, the support, the mainstay of 
success, centre in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, you must not tear, as it 
were, from a body its very strongest limbs."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>In the midst of these fierce exclamations, Valens, sending his 
lictors into the crowd, attempted to quell the mutiny. On this they attacked 
the general himself, hurled stones at him, and, when he fled, pursued him. 
Crying out that he was concealing the spoil of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, 
 the gold of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName>, the hire of their own 
toils, they ransacked his baggage, and probed with javelins and lances the 
walls of the general's tent and the very ground beneath. Valens, disguised 
in the garb of a slave, found concealment with a subaltern officer of 
cavalry. After this, Alfenius Varus, prefect of the camp, seeing that the 
mutiny was gradually subsiding, promoted the reaction by the following 
device. He forbade the centurions to visit the sentinels, and discontinued 
the trumpet calls by which the troops are summoned to their usual military 
duties. Thereupon all stood paralysed, and gazed at each other in amazement, 
panic-stricken by the very fact that there was no one to direct them. By 
their silence, by their submission, finally by their tears and entreaties, 
they craved forgiveness. But when Valens, thus unexpectedly preserved, came 
forward in sad plight, shedding tears, they were moved to joy, to pity, even 
to affection. Their revulsion to delight was just that of a mob always 
extreme in either emotion. They greeted him with praises and 
congratulations, and surrounding him with the eagles and standards, carried 
him to the tribunal. With a politic prudence he refrained from demanding 
capital punishment in any case; yet, fearing that he might lay himself more 
open to suspicion by concealment of his feelings, he censured a few persons, 
well aware that in civil wars the soldiers have more license than the 
generals.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>While they were fortifying a 
 camp at <placeName key="tgn,7006026">Ticinum</placeName>, the news of C&aelig;cina's defeat 
reached them, and the mutiny nearly broke out afresh from an impression that 
underhand dealing and delay on the part of Valens had kept them away from 
the battle. They refused all rest; they would not wait for their general: 
they advanced in front of the standards,

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">JUNCTURE 
OF VITELLIANIST ARMIES</note>
and hurried on the standard-bearers. After a 
rapid march they joined C&aelig;cina. The character of Valens did not stand 
well with C&aelig;cina's army. They complained that, though so much weaker 
in numbers, they had been exposed to the whole force of the enemy, thus at 
once excusing themselves, and extolling, in the implied flattery, the 
strength of the new arrivals, who might, they feared, despise them as beaten 
and spiritless soldiers. Though Valens had the stronger army, nearly double 
the number of legions and auxiliaries, yet the partialities of the soldiers 
inclined to C&aelig;cina, not only from the geniality of heart, which he was 
thought more ready to display, but even from his vigorous age, his 
commanding person, and a certain superficial attractiveness which he 
possessed. The result was a jealousy between the two generals. C&aelig;cina 
ridiculed his colleague as a man of foul and infamous character; Valens 
retorted with charges of emptiness and vanity. But concealing their enmity, 
they devoted themselves to their common interest, and in frequent letters, 
without any thought of pardon, heaped all manner of charges upon <persName>Otho</persName>, while 
the Othonianist generals, though they had the most abundant materials for 
invective against Vitellius, refrained from employing them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>In fact, before the death of these two men (and it 
was by his death that <persName>Otho</persName> gained high renown, as Vitellius incurred by his 
the foulest infamy), Vitellius with his indolent luxury was less dreaded 
than <persName>Otho</persName> with his ardent passions. The murder of Galba had made the one 
terrible and odious, while no one reckoned against the other the guilt of 
having begun the war. Vitellius with his sensuality and gluttony was his own 
enemy; <persName>Otho</persName>, with his profligacy, his cruelty, and his recklessness, was 
held to be more dangerous to the Commonwealth. When C&aelig;cina and Valens 
had united their forces, the Vitellianists had no longer any reason to delay 
giving battle with their whole strength. <persName>Otho</persName> deliberated as to whether 
protracting the war or risking an engagement were the better course. Then 
Suetonius Paullinus, thinking that it befitted his reputation, which was 
such that no one at that period was looked upon as a more skilful soldier, 
to give an opinion on the whole conduct of the war, contended

that impatience would benefit the enemy, while delay would serve 
their own cause.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>"The entire army of 
Vitellius," he said, "has already arrived. Nor have they much strength in 
their rear, since <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> is ready to rise, and to 
 abandon the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, when such hostile 
tribes are ready to burst in, would not answer his purpose. A hostile people 
and an intervening sea keep from him the army of <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>; <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> is not over full 
 of troops; <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName> has been cowed by the 
attack of our ships and by a defeat; <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> beyond 
 the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> is shut in by the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, cannot be relieved from the sea, and has been 
exhausted by the passage of his army. For that army there is nowhere any 
corn, and without supplies an army cannot be kept together. Then the 
Germans, the most formidable part of the enemy's forces, should the war be 
protracted into the summer, will sink with enfeebled frames under the change 
of country and climate. Many a war, formidable in its first impetuosity, has 
passed into nothing through the weariness of delay. We, on the other hand, 
have on all sides abundant resources and loyal adherents. We have <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName>, the East with its armies yet intact, we have 
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the capital 
of the Empire, the Senate, and the people, names that never lose their 
splendour, though they may sometimes be eclipsed. We have the wealth of the 
State and of private individuals. We have a vast supply of money, which in a 
civil war is a mightier weapon than the sword. Our soldiers are inured to 
the climate of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> or to yet greater heat. We have 
 the river <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> on our front, and cities strongly 
garrisoned and fortified, none of which will surrender to the enemy, as the 
defence of <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName> has proved. Let <persName>Otho</persName> therefore 
protract the war. In a few days the 14th legion, itself highly renowned, 
will arrive with the troops from <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>. He may 
then again consider the question, and should a battle be resolved on, we 
shall fight with increased strength."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>Marius Celsus acquiesced in the opinion of Paullinus; and Annius Gallus, who 
a few days before had been seriously injured by the fall of his horse, was 
reported to agree by those who had been sent to ascertain his opinion. <persName>Otho</persName> 
was inclined to risk a decisive battle. His brother Titianus,

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHO DETERMINES TO FIGHT</note>
and Proculus, the 
prefect of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard, ignorant and therefore impatient, 
declared that fortune, the Gods, and the genius of <persName>Otho</persName>, were with their 
counsels, and would be with their enterprises. That no one might dare to 
oppose their views, they had taken refuge in flattery. It having been 
resolved to give battle, it became a question whether it would be better for 
the Emperor to be present in person, or to withdraw. Paullinus and Celsus no 
longer opposed, for they would not seem to put the Emperor in the way of 
peril, and these same men who suggested the baser policy prevailed on him to 
retire to <placeName key="tgn,1043633">Brixellum</placeName>, and thus secure from the 
hazards of the field, to reserve himself for the administration of empire. 
That day first gave the death-blow to the party of <persName>Otho</persName>. Not only did a 
strong detachment of the Pr&aelig;torian cohorts, of the body guard, and of 
the cavalry, depart with him, but the spirit of those who remained was 
broken, for the men suspected their generals, and <persName>Otho</persName>, who alone had the 
confidence of the soldiers, while he himself trusted in none but them, had 
left the generals' authority on a doubtful footing.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>Nothing of this escaped the Vitellianists, for, as 
is usual in civil wars, there were many deserters, and the spies, while busy 
in inquiring into the plans of the enemy, failed to conceal their own. 
Meanwhile C&aelig;cina and Valens remained quiet, and watched intently for 
the moment when the enemy in his blindness should rush upon destruction, and 
found the usual substitute for wisdom in waiting for the folly of others. 
They began to form a bridge, making a feint of crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, in the face of an opposing force of gladiators; 
they wished also to keep their own soldiers from passing their unoccupied 
time in idleness. Boats were ranged at equal distances from each other, 
connected at both ends by strong beams, and with their heads turned against 
the current, while anchors were thrown out above to keep the bridge firm. 
The cables, however, instead of being taut, hung loose in the water, in 
order that as the stream rose the vessels might rise without their 
arrangement being disturbed. On the end of the bridge was placed a turret; 
it was built out on the last boat, and from it engines and machines might be 
worked to repel the enemy. The soldiers of

Otho also raised a 
turret on the opposite bank, and hurled from it stones and flaming 
missiles.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>In the middle of the river 
was an island. While the gladiators were making their way to it in boats, 
the Germans swam and outstripped them. A considerable number, as it chanced, 
had effected the passage, when Macer, having manned some light gallies, 
attacked them with the most active of his gladiators. But the gladiator has 
not in battle the firmness of the regular soldier, and now, as they stood on 
rocking vessels, they could not direct their blows like men who had a sure 
footing on land. As the men in their alarm made confused movements, rowers 
and combatants were mingled together in disorder; upon this, the Germans 
themselves leapt into the shallows, laid hold of the boats, climbed over the 
gunwales, or sank them with their hands. All this passed in the sight of 
both armies, and the more it delighted the Vitellianists, the more 
vehemently did the Othonianists curse the cause and author of the 
disaster.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>The conflict was terminated 
by the flight of the vanquished, who carried off what boats were left. Then 
they cried out for the execution of Macer. He had been wounded by a javelin 
thrown from a distance, and the soldiers had made a rush upon him with drawn 
swords, when he was saved by the interference of the tribunes and 
centurions. Soon after Vestricius Spurinna, having received orders to that 
effect from <persName>Otho</persName>, joined with his cohorts, leaving but a moderate force in 
garrison at <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>. After this <persName>Otho</persName> sent Flavius 
Sabinus, consul elect, to take the command of the troops which had been 
under Macer; the soldiers were delighted by this change of generals, while 
the generals were led by these continual outbreaks to regard with disgust so 
hateful a service.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>I find it stated by 
some authors that either the dread of war or the disgust felt for both 
Emperors, whose wickedness and infamy were coming out every day into more 
open notoriety, made the two armies hesitate whether they should not cease 
their strife, and either themselves consult together, or allow the Senate to 
choose an Emperor; and that, for this reason, <persName>Otho</persName>'s generals recommended a 
certain measure of delay, Paullinus especially entertaining

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">PASSION FOR POWER CAUSES CIVIL WARS</note>
hopes for himself, on 
the ground that he was the senior among the men of consular rank, that he 
was well known as a soldier, and had attained great distinction and fame by 
his campaigns in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. Though I would allow that 
there were some few who in their secret wishes prayed for peace in the stead 
of disorder, for a worthy and blameless Emperor in the room of men utterly 
worthless and wicked, yet I cannot suppose that Paullinus, wise as he was, 
could have hoped in an age thoroughly depraved to find such moderation in 
the common herd, as that men, who in their passion for war had trampled 
peace under foot, should now in their affection for peace renounce the 
charms of war; nor can I think that armies differing in language and in 
character, could have united in such an agreement; or that lieutenants and 
generals, who were for the most part burdened by the consciousness of 
profligacy, of poverty, and of crime, could have endured any Emperor who was 
not himself stained by vice, as well as bound by obligation to 
themselves.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>That old passion for 
power which has been ever innate in man increased and broke out as the 
Empire grew in greatness. In a state of moderate dimensions equality was 
easily preserved; but when the world had been subdued, when all rival kings 
and cities had been destroyed, and men had leisure to covet wealth which 
they might enjoy in security, the early conflicts between the patricians and 
the people were kindled into flame. At one time the tribunes were factious, 
at another the consuls had unconstitutional power; it was in the capital and 
the forum that we first essayed civil wars. Then rose C. Marius, sprung from 
the very dregs of the populace, and L. Sulla, the most ruthless of the 
patricians, who perverted into absolute dominion the liberty which had 
yielded to their arms. After them came Cn. Pompeius, with a character more 
disguised but no way better. Henceforth men's sole object was supreme power. 
Legions formed of Roman citizens did not lay down their arms at <placeName key="perseus,Pharsalos">Pharsalia</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName>, much 
less were the armies of <persName>Otho</persName> and Vitellius likely of their own accord to 
abandon their strife. They were driven into civil war by the same wrath from 
heaven, the same madness among men, the same incentives to crime. That these 
wars were terminated by what we

may call single blows, was owing 
to want of energy in the chiefs. But these reflections on the character of 
ancient and modern times have carried me too far from my subject. I now 
return to the course of events.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p><persName>Otho</persName> 
 having started for <placeName key="tgn,1043633">Brixellum</placeName>, the honours of supreme 
command devolved on his brother Titianus, while the real power and control 
were in the hands of the prefect Proculus. Celsus and Paullinus, as no one 
made any use of their skill, did but screen with their idle title of general 
the blunders of others. The tribunes and centurions were perplexed to see 
that better men were despised, and that the most worthless carried the day. 
The common soldiers were full of eagerness, but liked to criticise rather 
than to obey the orders of their officers. It was resolved to move the camp 
forward to the fourth milestone from <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, but 
it was done so unskilfully, that though it was spring, and there were so 
many rivers in the neighbourhood, the troops were distressed for want of 
water. Then the subject of giving battle was discussed, <persName>Otho</persName> in his 
despatches ever urging them to make haste, and the soldiers demanding that 
the Emperor should be present at the conflict; many begged that the troops 
quartered beyond the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> should be brought up. It 
is not so easy to determine what was best to be done, as it is to be sure 
that what was done was the very worst.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>They started for a campaign rather than for a battle making for 
 the confluence of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1120958">Addua</placeName>, a distance of sixteen miles from their position. 
Celsus and Paullinus remonstrated against exposing troops wearied with a 
march and encumbered with baggage to any enemy, who, being himself ready for 
action and having marched barely four miles, would not fail to attack them, 
either when they were in the confusion of an advance, or when they were 
dispersed and busy with the work of entrenchment. Titianus and Proculus, 
overcome in argument, fell back on the Imperial authority. It was true that 
a Numidian had arrived at full gallop with an angry message from <persName>Otho</persName>, in 
which the Emperor, sick of delay and impatient of suspense, sharply rebuked 
the inactivity of the generals, and commanded that matters should be brought 
to an issue.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">BATTLE OF <placeName>BEDRIACUM</placeName></note><p>The same 
day, while C&aelig;cina was engaged on the construction of a bridge, two 
tribunes of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard came to him and begged an interview. 
He was on the point of hearing their proposals and sending back his own, 
when the scouts arrived at headlong speed with the news that the enemy were 
close at hand. The address of the tribunes was thus abruptly terminated. 
Thus it remained uncertain whether deception, or treason, or some honourable 
arrangement, had been in their thoughts. C&aelig;cina dismissed the tribunes 
and rode back to the camp. There he found that Fabius Valens had given the 
signal for battle, and that the troops were under arms. While the legions 
were casting lots for the order of march, the cavalry charged, and, strange 
to say, were kept only by the courage of the Italian legion from being 
driven back on the entrenchments by an inferior force of Othonianists. These 
men, at the sword's point, compelled the beaten squadron to wheel round and 
resume the conflict. The line of the Vitellianists was formed without hurry, 
for, though the enemy was close at hand, the sight of their arms was 
intercepted by the thick brushwood. In <persName>Otho</persName>'s army the generals were full of 
fear, and the soldiers hated their officers; the baggage-waggons and the 
camp-followers were mingled with the troops; and as there were steep ditches 
on both sides the road, it would have been found too narrow even for an 
undisturbed advance. Some were gathering round their standards; others were 
seeking them; everywhere was heard the confused shouting of men who were 
joining the ranks, or calling to their comrades, and each, as he was 
prompted by courage or by cowardice, rushed on to the front, or slunk back 
to the rear.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>From the consternation of 
panic their feelings passed under the influence of a groundless joy into 
languid indifference, some persons spreading the lie that Vitellius' army 
had revolted. Whether this rumour was circulated by the spies of Vitellius, 
or originated in treachery or in accident among the partisans of <persName>Otho</persName>, has 
never been clearly ascertained. Forgetting their warlike ardour, the 
Othonianists at once greeted the foe; as they were answered by an angry 
murmur, they caused apprehensions of treachery in many of their own side, 
who did not know what the greeting

meant. Then the enemy's line 
charged with its ranks unbroken, in strength and in numbers superior; the 
Othonianists, scattered and weary as they were, met the attack with spirit. 
The ground was so entangled with trees and vineyards that the battle assumed 
many forms. They met in close and in distant conflict, in line and in 
column. On the raised road they stood foot to foot, they pushed with their 
bodies and their shields, and ceasing to throw their javelins, they struck 
through helmets and breastplates with swords and battle-axes. Recognising 
each other and distinctly seen by the rest of the combatants, they were 
fighting to decide the whole issue of the war.</p></div2>
 <div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>In an open plain between the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> and 
the road, two legions happened to meet. On the side of Vitellius was the 
21st, called the Rapax, a corps of old and distinguished renown. On that of 
<persName>Otho</persName> was the 1st, called Adjutrix, which had never before been brought into 
the field, but was high-spirited, and eager to gain its first triumph. The 
men of the 1st, overthrowing the foremost ranks of the 21st, carried off the 
eagle. The 21st, infuriated by this loss, not only repulsed the 1st, and 
slew the legate, Orfidius Benignus, but captured many colours and standards 
from the enemy. In another quarter the 13th legion was put to flight by a 
charge of the 5th. The 14th was surrounded by a superior force. <persName>Otho</persName>'s 
generals had long since fled, and C&aelig;cina and Valens strengthened their 
army with the reserves. New reinforcements were supplied by Varus Alfenius 
with his Batavians. They had routed the band of gladiators, which had been 
ferried across the river, and which had been cut to pieces by the opposing 
cohorts while they were actually in the water. Thus flushed with victory, 
they charged the flank of the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>The centre of their line had been penetrated, and the Othonianists fled on 
all sides in the direction of <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>. The 
distance was very great, and the roads were blocked up with heaps of 
corpses; thus the slaughter was the greater, for captives taken in civil war 
can be turned to no profit. Suetonius Paullinus and Licinius Proculus, 
taking different roads, avoided the camp. Vedius Aquila, legate of the 13th 
legion, in the blindness of fear, fell in the way of the furious

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CAPITULATION OF OTHONIASTS</note>
soldiery. Late in 
the day he entered the entrenchments, and found himself the centre of a mob 
of clamorous and mutinous fugitives. They did not refrain from abuse or 
actual violence; they reviled him as a deserter and traitor, not having any 
specific charge against him, but all, after the fashion of the mob, imputing 
to him their own crimes. Titianus and Celsus were favoured by the darkness. 
By that time the sentries had been posted, and the soldiers reduced to 
order. Annius Gallus had prevailed upon them by his prayers, his advice, and 
his personal influence, not to aggravate the disaster of their defeat by 
mutual slaughter. Whether the war was at an end, or whether they might 
choose to resume the conflict, the vanquished would find in union the sole 
mitigation of their lot. The spirit of the rest of the army was broken, but 
the Pr&aelig;torians angrily complained that they had been vanquished, not 
by valour, but by treachery. "The Vitellianists indeed," they said, "gained 
no bloodless victory; their cavalry was defeated, a legion lost its eagle. 
We have still the troops beyond the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, and <persName>Otho</persName> 
 himself. The legions of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> are coming; a 
great part of the army remained at <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>; these 
certainly were never vanquished; and if it must be so, it is on the 
battle-field that we shall fall with most honour." Amid all the exasperation 
or terror of these thoughts, the extremity of despair yet roused them to 
fury rather than to fear.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>The army of 
Vitellius bivouacked at the fifth milestone from <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>. The generals did not venture an assault on 
the enemy's camp that same day; besides, a capitulation was expected. Though 
they were without baggage, and had marched out only to fight, it was 
sufficient protection to them that they had arms, and were victorious. On 
the following day, as the feeling of <persName>Otho</persName>'s army was evident, and those who 
had been most furious were inclined to repent, envoys were sent, nor did the 
generals of Vitellius hesitate to grant conditions of peace. The envoys 
indeed were detained for some little time, and this circumstance caused some 
doubt, as it was not known whether they had obtained their object; before 
long, however, they returned, and the camp was thrown open. Both victors and 
vanquished melted into tears, and cursed the fatality of civil

strife with a melancholy joy. There in the same tents did they dress 
the wounds of brothers or of kinsmen. Their hopes, their rewards, were all 
uncertain; death and sorrow were sure. And no one had so escaped misfortune 
as to have no bereavement to lament. Search was made for the body of the 
legate Orfidius, and it was burnt with the customary honours. A few were 
buried by their friends; the multitude that remained were left above 
ground.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p><persName>Otho</persName> was awaiting news of the 
battle free from alarm and resolved in purpose. First came gloomy tidings, 
and then fugitives from the field, making known that all was lost. The zeal 
of the soldiers did not wait for the Emperor to speak. They bade him be of 
good cheer, telling him that he had still fresh forces, and that they would 
themselves endure and dare to the last. This was no flattery; they were 
fired by a furious impulse to seek the battle-field, and raise again the 
fallen fortunes of their party. Those who stood at a distance stretched out 
their arms, those who were near clasped the Emperor's knees, and Plotius 
Firmus was the most zealous of them all. This man, who was prefect of the 
Pr&aelig;torian Guard, repeatedly besought <persName>Otho</persName> not to desert an army so 
loyal and soldiers so deserving; "there was more courage in bearing 
trouble," he said, "than in escaping from it; the brave and the energetic 
cling to hope, even in spite of fortune; the cowardly and the indolent are 
hurried into despair by their fears." While he was thus speaking, as <persName>Otho</persName> 
assumed a relenting or a stern expression, the soldiers cheered or groaned. 
Nor was it only the Pr&aelig;torians, who were peculiarly <persName>Otho</persName>'s troops, 
 that thus acted; those who had been sent on from <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> declared that the approaching army was as 
firmly resolved, and that the legions had entered <placeName key="perseus,Aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>. No one therefore can doubt that the war might 
have been renewed with its terrible disasters, and its uncertainties both 
for victors and vanquished.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p><persName>Otho</persName> 
himself was opposed to all thoughts of war. He said, "I hold that to expose 
such a spirit, such a courage as yours, to any further risk is to put too 
high a value on my life. The more hope you hold out to me, should I choose 
to live, the more glorious will be my death. Fortune and I now know each 
other; you need not reckon for how long, for it

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OTHO'S LAST MOMENTS</note>
is peculiarly difficult to be moderate 
with that prosperity which you think you will not long enjoy. The civil war 
began with Vitellius; he was the first cause of our contending in arms for 
the throne; the example of not contending more than once shall belong to me. 
By this let posterity judge of <persName>Otho</persName>. Vitellius is welcome to his brother, 
his wife, his children. I need neither revenge nor consolation. Others may 
have held the throne for a longer time, but no one can have left it with 
such fortitude. Shall I suffer so large a portion of the youth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and so many noble armies to be again laid low and 
to be lost to the State? Let this thought go with me, that you were willing 
to die for me. But live, and let us no longer delay, lest I interfere with 
your safety, you with my firmness. To say too much about one's end is a mark 
of cowardice. Take as the strongest proof of my determination the fact that 
I complain of no one. To accuse either gods or men is only for him who 
wishes to live."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>After having thus 
spoken, he courteously entreated all in terms befitting their age and rank 
to go at once, and not exasperate the anger of the conqueror by staying. 
With the young he used his authority, with the old his prayers, and still 
his look was calm, his speech collected, as he checked the unseasonable 
tears of his friends. He gave orders that those who were departing should be 
furnished with boats and carriages; he destroyed all memorials and letters 
remarkable for their expressions of zeal for himself or their abuse of 
Vitellius. He distributed some gratuities, but sparingly, and not like a man 
who was soon to die. Then he even administered consolation to Salvius 
Cocceianus, his brother's son, a very young man, who was anxious and 
sorrowful, praising his affection while he rebuked his fear. "Do you think," 
he said, "that Vitellius will shew so ruthless a temper that he will not 
make even this return for the preservation of his whole family? By hastening 
my end I earn the clemency of the conqueror. It is not in the extremity of 
despair, but while my army yet cries for battle that I have sacrificed to 
the State my last chance. I have obtained enough reputation for myself, 
enough nobility for my family. Successor to the Julii, the Claudii, the 
Servii, I have been the first to bring the Imperial dignity into a new 
fam-

ily. Enter then on life with a brave heart, and never 
entirely forget, or remember too vividly, that <persName>Otho</persName> was your uncle.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>After this he dismissed every one, and took 
some repose. He was now pondering in his heart the last cares of life, when 
his attention was distracted by a sudden tumult and he was told of the 
confusion and outrageous conduct of the soldiers. They were threatening with 
death all who attempted to depart, and were extreme in their violence 
against Verginius, whose house they had blockaded and were besieging. After 
rebuking the ringleaders of the tumult, he returned and employed himself in 
granting interviews to those who were departing, till all had left in 
safety. Towards evening he quenched his thirst with a draught of cold water. 
Two daggers were brought to him; he tried the edge of each, and then put one 
under his head. After satisfying himself that his friends had set out, he 
passed a tranquil night, and it is even said that he slept. At dawn he fell 
with his breast upon the steel. Hearing a groan from the dying man, his 
freedmen and slaves, and Plotius Firmus, prefect of the Pr&aelig;torian 
Guard, came in. They found but one wound. His funeral was hastily performed. 
He had made this the subject of earnest entreaties, anxious that his head 
might not be cut off and subjected to indignities. The Pr&aelig;torian 
cohorts carried his body with praises and tears, covering his wound and his 
hands with kisses. Some of the soldiers killed themselves near the funeral 
pile, not moved by remorse or by fear, but by the desire to emulate his 
glory, and by love of their Prince. Afterwards this kind of death became a 
common practice among all ranks at <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, at <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>, and in the other camps. Over <persName>Otho</persName> was built a 
tomb unpretending and therefore likely to stand.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>Thus <persName>Otho</persName> ended his life in the 37th year of his age. He came 
from the municipal town of <placeName key="perseus,Ferentinum">Ferentinum</placeName>. His father 
was of consular, his grandfather of pr&aelig;torian rank. His family on the 
mother's side was of less distinction, but yet respectable. What his boyhood 
and his youth had been, we have already shewn. By two daring acts, one most 
atrocious, the other singularly noble, he earned in the eyes of posterity 
about an equal share of infamy and of glory. I should think it unbecoming 
the dignity of the task which I

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">EMBARRASSMENT OF 
SENATE</note>
have undertaken, to collect fabulous marvels, and to amuse 
with fiction the tastes of my readers; at the same time I would not venture 
to impugn the credit of common report and tradition. The natives of these 
parts relate that on the day when the battle was being fought at <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, a bird of unfamiliar appearance settled in a 
 much frequented grove near <placeName key="tgn,7005020">Regium Lepidum</placeName>, and was 
not frightened or driven away by the concourse of people, or by the 
multitude of birds that flocked round it, until <persName>Otho</persName> killed himself; then it 
vanished. When they came to compute the time, it was found that the 
commencement and the end of this strange occurrence tallied with the last 
scenes of <persName>Otho</persName>'s life.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>At the funeral 
the mutinous spirit of the soldiers was kindled afresh by their sorrow and 
regret, and there was no one to check them. They turned to Verginius, and in 
threatening language, at one time besought him to accept the Imperial 
dignity, at another, to act as envoy to C&aelig;cina and Valens. Verginius 
secretly departed by a back way from his house, and thus managed to elude 
them when they burst in. Rubrius Gallus was charged with the petition of the 
cohorts which had been quartered at <placeName key="tgn,1043633">Brixellum</placeName>. An 
amnesty was immediately granted to them, while at the same time the forces 
which had been commanded by Flavius Sabinus signified through him their 
submission to the conqueror.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>Hostilities had ceased everywhere, but a considerable number of the Senate, 
who had accompanied <persName>Otho</persName> from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and had been 
afterwards left at <placeName key="perseus,Mutina">Mutina</placeName>, encountered the utmost 
peril. News of the defeat was brought to this place. The soldiers, however, 
rejected it as a false report; and judging the Senate to be hostile to <persName>Otho</persName>, 
watched their language, and put an unfavourable construction on their looks 
and manner. Proceeding at last to abuse and insults, they sought a pretext 
for beginning a massacre, while a different anxiety also weighed upon the 
Senators, who, knowing that the party of Vitellius was in the ascendant, 
feared that they might seem to have been tardy in welcoming the conqueror. 
Thus they met in great alarm and distracted by a twofold apprehension; no 
one was ready with any advice of his own, but looked for safety in sharing 
any mistake with many others. The anxieties of the terrified assembly

were aggravated when the Senate of <placeName key="perseus,Mutina">Mutina</placeName> 
made them an offer of arms and money, and, with an ill-timed compliment, 
styled them "Conscript Fathers."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>There then ensued a notable quarrel, Licinius C&aelig;cina inveighing 
against Marcellus Eprius, for using ambiguous language. The rest indeed did 
not express their opinions, but the name of Marcellus, exposed as it was to 
odium from the hateful recollection of his career as an informer, had roused 
in C&aelig;cina, who was an unknown man, and had lately been made a Senator, 
the hope of distinguishing himself by making great enemies. The moderation 
of wiser men put an end to the dispute. They all returned to <placeName key="perseus,Bononia">Bononia</placeName>, intending there to deliberate again, and also 
expecting further news in the meantime. At <placeName key="perseus,Bononia">Bononia</placeName> 
they posted men on the different roads to make enquiries of every new comer; 
one of <persName>Otho</persName>'s freedmen, on being questioned as to the cause of his 
departure, replied that he was entrusted with his master's last commands; 
<persName>Otho</persName> was still alive, he said, when he left him, but his only thoughts were 
for posterity, and he had torn himself from all the fascinations of life. 
They were struck with admiration, and were ashamed to put any more 
questions, and then the hearts of all turned to Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>Lucius Vitellius, the brother of the Emperor, was 
present at their deliberations, and was preparing to receive their 
flatteries, when of a sudden C&oelig;nus, a freedman of <persName>Nero</persName>, threw them all 
into consternation by an outrageous falsehood. He asserted that, by the 
arrival of the 14th legion, joined to the forces from <placeName key="tgn,1043633">Brixellum</placeName>, the victorious army had been routed and the 
fortunes of the party changed. The object of this fabrication was that the 
passports of <persName>Otho</persName>, which were beginning to be disregarded, might through 
more favourable news recover their validity. C&oelig;nus was conveyed with 
rapidity to the capital, but a few days after suffered the penalty of his 
crime by the order of Vitellius. The peril of the Senators was increased by 
the soldiers of <persName>Otho</persName>'s army believing that the intelligence thus brought was 
authentic. Their alarm was heightened by the fact that their departure from 
<placeName key="perseus,Mutina">Mutina</placeName> and their desertion of the party had the 
appearance of a public resolution. They did not meet again for general 
deliberation, but every man consulted his own

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">USUAL HONORS TO VITELLIUS</note>
safety, till letters arrived from 
Fabius Valens which removed their fear. Besides, the very glory of Otho's 
death made the news travel more quickly.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, however, there was no alarm; 
the games of <persName>Ceres</persName> were attended as usual. When trustworthy messengers 
brought into the theatre the news that <persName>Otho</persName> was dead, and that all the 
troops in the capital had taken the oath to Vitellius under the direction of 
Flavius Sabinus, prefect of the city, the spectators greeted the name of 
Vitellius with applause. The people carried round the temples images of 
Galba, ornamented with laurel leaves and flowers, and piled chaplets in the 
form of a sepulchral mound near the lake of Curtius, 
on the very spot which had been stained with the blood of the dying man. In 
the Senate all the customary honours, which had been devised during the long 
reigns of other Emperors, were forthwith decreed. Public acknowledgments and 
thanks were also given to the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and 
envoys were sent charged with congratulations. There was read a letter from 
Fabius Valens to the consuls, which was written in a not unbecoming style, 
but they liked better the modesty of C&aelig;cina in not writing at 
all.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p><placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, 
however, was prostrated under sufferings heavier and more terrible than the 
evils of war. The soldiers of Vitellius, dispersed through the municipal 
towns and colonies, were robbing and plundering and polluting every place 
with violence and lust. Everything, lawful or unlawful, they were ready to 
seize or to sell, sparing nothing, sacred or profane. Some persons under the 
soldiers' garb murdered their private enemies. The soldiers themselves, who 
knew the country well, marked out rich estates and wealthy owners for 
plunder, or for death in case of resistance; their commanders were in their 
power and dared not check them. C&aelig;cina indeed was not so rapacious as 
he was fond of popularity; Valens was so notorious for his dishonest gains 
and peculations that he was disposed to conceal the crimes of others. The 
resources of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> had long been impaired, and the 
presence of so vast a force of infantry and cavalry, with the outrages, the 
losses, and the wrongs they inflicted, was more than it could well 
endure.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>Meanwhile Vitellius, as yet 
unaware of his victory

was bringing up the remaining strength of 
the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> just as if the campaign had yet 
to be fought. A few of the old soldiers were left in the winter quarters, 
and the conscription throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> was hastily 
proceeded with, in order that the muster-rolls of the legions which remained 
behind might be filled up. The defence of the bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> was entrusted to Hordeonius Flaccus. Vitellius 
himself added to his own army 8000 men of the British conscription. He had 
proceeded a few days' march, when he received intelligence of the victory at 
<placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, and of the termination of the war through 
<persName>Otho</persName>'s death. He called an assembly, and heaped praises on the valour of the 
soldiers. When the army demanded that he should confer equestrian rank on 
Asiaticus his freedman, he checked the disgraceful flattery. Then, with his 
characteristic fickleness, in the privacy of a banquet he granted the very 
distinction which he had publicly refused; and honoured with the ring of 
Knighthood this same Asiaticus, a slave of infamous character, ever seeking 
power by unprincipled intrigues.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>About 
the same time news came to Vitellius that the procurator Albinus had fallen, 
and that both the provinces of <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName> had 
declared for him. Lucceius Albinus, whom <persName>Nero</persName> had appointed to the 
 government of <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName> C&aelig;sariensis, to which 
Galba had subsequently added the charge of the province of <placeName>Tingitana</placeName>, had the disposal of no contemptible force. He 
had with him 19 cohorts of infantry, 5 squadrons of cavalry, and a vast 
number of Moors, a force trained to war by robbery and plunder. When Galba 
had fallen, he was strongly disposed in favour of <persName>Otho</persName>. He even looked 
 beyond <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> and threatened <placeName key="1000095">Spain</placeName>, which is separated from it only by a narrow 
strait. This alarmed Cluvius Rufus, who ordered the 10th legion to approach 
the coast, as if he intended to send them across. Some of the centurions 
were sent on before to gain for Vitellius the good-will of the Moors. This 
was no difficult task, as the fame of the German army was great in the 
provinces. Besides this, a report was circulated that Albinus, scorning the 
title of procurator, was assuming the insignia of royalty and the name of 
Juba.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>The tide of feeling turned, and 
Asinius Pollio, one of

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">MOVEMENTS OF 
VITELLIUS</note>
the stanchest friends of Albinus, prefect of one of the 
squadrons of cavalry, with <persName>Festus</persName> and <persName>Scipio</persName>, prefects of two infantry 
 cohorts, were killed. Albinus himself, who was sailing from the province <placeName>Tingitana</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName> 
C&aelig;sariensis, was murdered as he reached the shore. His wife threw 
herself in the way of the murderers and was killed with him. Vitellius made 
no inquiries into what was going on. He dismissed matters of even the 
greatest importance with brief hearing, and was quite unequal to any serious 
business. He directed the army to proceed by land, but sailed himself down 
the river <placeName key="tgn,1129316">Arar</placeName>. His progress had nothing of imperial 
state about it, but was marked by the poverty of his former condition, till 
Junius Bl&aelig;sus, governor of Gallia Lugdunensis, a man of noble birth, 
whose munificence was equal to his wealth, furnished him with suitable 
attendance, and escorted him with a splendid retinue; a service which was of 
itself displeasing, though Vitellius masked his dislike under servile 
compliments. At <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName> the generals of the two 
parties, the conquerors and the conquered, were waiting for him. Valens and 
C&aelig;cina he put by his own chair of state, after celebrating their 
praises before a general assembly. He then ordered the whole army to come 
and greet his infant son; he brought him out, wrapped in a military cloak, 
and holding him in his arms, gave him the title of Germanicus, and 
surrounded him with all the insignia of the imperial rank. It was an 
extravagant distinction for a day of prosperity, but it served as a 
consolation in adversity.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p>Then the 
bravest centurions among the Othonianists were put to death. This, more than 
anything else, alienated from Vitellius the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>. At the same time the other legions, 
influenced by the contagion of example, and by their dislike of the German 
troops, were meditating war. Vitellius detained Suetonius Paullinus and 
Licinus Proculus in all the wretchedness of an odious imprisonment; when 
they were heard, they resorted to a defence, necessary rather than 
honourable. They actually claimed the merit of having been traitors, 
attributing to their own dishonest counsels the long march before the 
battle, the fatigue of <persName>Otho</persName>'s troops, the entanglement of the line with the 
baggage-waggons, and many circumstances which were really accidental. 
Vitellius

gave them credit for perfidy, and acquitted them of the 
crime of loyalty. Salvius Titianus, the brother of <persName>Otho</persName>, was never in any 
peril, for his brotherly affection and his apathetic character screened him 
from danger. Marius Celsus had his consulship confirmed to him. It was 
commonly believed, however, and was afterwards made a matter of accusation 
in the Senate against C&aelig;cilius Simplex, that he had sought to purchase 
this honour, and with it the destruction of Celsus. Vitellius refused, and 
afterwards bestowed on Simplex a consulship that had not to be bought with 
crime or with money. Trachalus was protected against his accusers by Galeria 
the wife of Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>Amid the 
adventures of these illustrious men, one is ashamed to relate how a certain 
Mariccus, a Boian of the lowest origin, pretending to divine inspiration, 
ventured to thrust himself into fortune's game, and to challenge the arms of 
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Calling himself the champion of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and a God (for he had assumed this title), he had 
now collected 8000 men, and was taking possession of the neighbouring 
villages of the &AElig;dui, when that most formidable state attacked him 
with a picked force of its native youth, to which Vitellius attached some 
cohorts, and dispersed the crowd of fanatics. Mariccus was captured in the 
engagement, and was soon after exposed to wild beasts, but not having been 
torn by them was believed by the senseless multitude to be invulnerable, 
till he was put to death in the presence of Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>No further severities were exercised on the persons 
of the opposite faction, or with property in any case; the wills of those 
who had fallen fighting for <persName>Otho</persName> were held to be valid, and with those who 
died intestate, the law was carried out. Assuredly, could Vitellius have 
bridled his luxurious tastes, no one need have dreaded his rapacity. He had 
a scandalous and insatiable passion for feasts; the provocatives of gluttony 
were conveyed to him from the capital and from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Italy</placeName>, till the roads from both seas resounded with 
traffic; the leading men of the various states were ruined by having to 
furnish his entertainments, and the states themselves reduced to beggary; 
the soldiers fast degenerated from their old activity and valour, through 
habitual indulgence and contempt of their leader. He sent on before him

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">EXCESSES OF VITELLIUS</note>
to the capital an edict, 
by which he postponed his acceptance of the title of Augustus and refused 
that of C&aelig;sar, though he relinquished nothing of his actual power. The 
astrologers were banished from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. The Roman 
Knights were forbidden, under severe penalties, to degrade themselves by 
appearing in public entertainments, or in the arena. Former Emperors had 
encouraged the practice by bribes, or more frequently enforced it by 
compulsion; and many of the towns and colonies had vied with each other in 
attracting by large pay the most profligate of the youth.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>Vitellius, however, when his brother joined him, 
and when those who are skilled in the arts of despotism began to creep into 
his confidence, grew more arrogant and cruel. He ordered the execution of 
Dolabella, whose banishment by <persName>Otho</persName> to the <placeName>Colonia 
Aquinas</placeName> I have before mentioned. Dolabella, on hearing of the death of 
<persName>Otho</persName>, had entered the capital. Plancius Varus, who had filled the office of 
pr&aelig;tor, and had been one of Dolabella's intimate friends, founded on 
this a charge, which he laid before Flavius Sabinus, prefect of the city, 
implying that Dolabella had escaped from custody, and had offered to put 
himself at the head of the vanquished party; and he also alleged that the 
cohort stationed at <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName> had been tampered with. Of 
these grave accusations he brought no proof whatever, and then repenting, 
sought, when the crime had been consummated, a pardon which could be of no 
avail. Flavius Sabinus hesitating to act in a matter of such importance, 
Triaria, the wife of Lucius Vitellius, with unfeminine ferocity, warned him 
not to seek a reputation for clemency by imperilling the Emperor. Sabinus 
was naturally of a mild disposition, but under the pressure of fear was 
easily swayed; here, the danger of another made him tremble for himself, 
and, lest he might seem to have helped the accused, he precipitated his 
fall.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>Upon this, Vitellius, who, 
besides fearing Dolabella, hated him, because he had married <persName>Petronia</persName>, his 
former wife, summoned him by letter, and at the same time gave orders that, 
without passing along the much frequented thoroughfare of the Flaminian 
road, he should turn aside to <placeName key="perseus,Interamna Nahars">Interamna</placeName>, and there 
be put to death. This seemed too tedious to the executioner, who in a 
road-side tavern struck down

his prisoner, and cut his throat. 
The act brought great odium upon the new reign, and was noted as the first 
indication of its character. Triaria's recklessness was rendered more 
intolerable by an immediate contrast with the exemplary virtue of Galeria, 
the Emperor's wife, who took no part in these horrors, and with Sextilia, 
the mother of the two Vitellii, a woman equally blameless, and of the old 
type of character. She indeed is said to have exclaimed on receiving the 
first letter from her son, "I am the mother, not of Germanicus, but of 
Vitellius." And in after days no seductions of fortune, no flattery from the 
State, could move her to exultation; it was only the misfortunes of her 
family that she felt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>M. Cluvius 
Rufus, who had left his government in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, came up 
with Vitellius after his departure from <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName>. He 
wore a look of joy and congratulation, but he was anxious at heart, for he 
knew that he was the object of accusations. Hilarius, the Emperor's 
freedman, had indeed brought this charge against him, that on hearing of the 
contest for the throne between Vitellius and <persName>Otho</persName>, he had made an attempt to 
secure power for himself, and to obtain possession of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and that with this view he had not headed his 
passports with the name of any Emperor. Some extracts from the speeches of 
Rufus he represented as insulting to Vitellius, and intended to win 
popularity for himself. So strong, however, was the influence of Cluvius, 
that Vitellius actually ordered the freedman to be punished. Cluvius was 
attached to the Emperor's retinue; <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> however was 
not taken from him; he still governed the province though not resident, as 
L. Arruntius had done before him, whom Tiberius C&aelig;sar detained at 
home, because he feared him; it was not from any apprehension that Vitellius 
kept Cluvius with him. The same compliment was not paid to Trebellius 
Maximus. He had fled from <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> because of the 
exasperation of the soldiery. Vettius Bolanus, who was then accompanying the 
Emperor, was sent to succeed him.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>Vitellius was troubled by the spirit of the vanquished legions, which was 
any thing but broken. Scattered through all parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and mingled with the conquerors, they spoke the 
language of enemies. The soldiers of the 14th

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIUS' VENGEANCE</note>
legion were peculiarly furious. They 
said that they had not been vanquished; that at the battle of <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName> only the veterans had been beaten, and that 
the strength of the legion had been absent. It was resolved that these 
troops should be sent back to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, from which 
province <persName>Nero</persName> had summoned them, and that the Batavian cohorts should in the 
meantime be quartered with them, because there was an old feud between them 
and the 14th. In the presence of such animosities between these armed 
masses, harmony did not last long. At <placeName key="perseus,Augusta">Augusta</placeName> of the Taurini it happened 
that a Batavian soldier fiercely charged some artisan with having cheated 
him, and that a soldier of the legion took the part of his host. Each man's 
comrades gathered round him; from words they came to blows, and a fierce 
battle would have broken out, had not two Pr&aelig;torian cohorts taken the 
side of the 14th, and given confidence to them, while they intimidated the 
Batavians. Vitellius then ordered that these latter troops should be 
attached to his own force, in consideration of their loyalty, and that the 
legion should pass over the <placeName key="tgn,7007763">Graian Alps</placeName>, and then 
 take that line of road, by which they would avoid passing <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName>, for the inhabitants of that place were also 
suspected. On the night of the departure of the legion, a part of the <placeName>Colonia Taurina</placeName> was destroyed by the fires which were 
left in every direction. This loss, like many of the evils of war, was 
forgotten in the greater disasters which happened to other cities. When the 
14th had made the descent on the other side of the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, the most mutinous among them were for carrying the 
 standards to <placeName key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName>. They were checked, however, by 
the united efforts of the better disposed, and the legion was transported 
into <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p>Vitellius found his next cause of apprehension in the Pr&aelig;torian 
cohorts. They were first divided, and then ordered, though with the 
gratifying compliment of an honourable discharge, to give up their arms to 
their tribunes. But as the arms of Vespasian gathered strength, they 
returned to their old service, and constituted the main stay of the 
Flavianist party. The first legion from the fleet was sent into <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, that in the peaceful repose of that province 
their excitement might subside; the 7th and 11th were sent back to

their winter quarters; the 13th were ordered to erect amphitheatres, 
for both C&aelig;cina at <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and Valens at <placeName key="perseus,Bononia">Bononia</placeName>, were preparing to exhibit shows of gladiators. 
Vitellius indeed was never so intent on the cares of Empire as to forget his 
pleasures.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>Though he had thus quietly 
divided the conquered party, there arose a disturbance among the conquerors. 
It began in sport, but the number of those who fell aggravated the horrors 
of the war. Vitellius had sat down to a banquet at <placeName key="tgn,7006026">Ticinum</placeName>, and had invited Verginius to be his guest. The 
legates and tribunes always follow the character of the Emperor, and either 
imitate his strictness, or indulge in early conviviality. And the soldiers 
in like manner are either diligent or lax in their duty. About Vitellius all 
was disorder and drunkenness, more like a nocturnal feast and revel than a 
properly disciplined camp. Thus it happened that two soldiers, one of whom 
belonged to the 5th legion, while the other was one of the Gallic 
auxiliaries, challenged each other in sport to a wrestling match. The 
legionary was thrown, and the <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> taunted him. The 
soldiers who had assembled to witness the contest took different sides, till 
the legionaries made a sudden and murderous attack on the auxiliary troops, 
and destroyed two cohorts. The first disturbance was checked only by a 
second. A cloud of dust and the glitter of arms were seen at a distance. A 
sudden cry was raised that the 14th legion had retraced its steps, and was 
advancing to the attack. It was in fact the rearguard of the army, and their 
recognition removed the cause of alarm. Meanwhile a slave of Verginius 
happened to come in their way. He was charged with having designed the 
assassination of Vitellius. The soldiers rushed to the scene of the banquet, 
and loudly demanded the death of Verginius. Even Vitellius, tremblingly 
alive as he was to all suspicions, had no doubt of his innocence. Yet he 
could hardly check the troops when they clamoured for the death of a man of 
consular rank, formerly their own general. Indeed there was no one who was 
more frequently the object of all kinds of outbreaks than Verginius; the man 
still was admired, still retained his high reputation, but they hated him 
with the hatred of those who are despised.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="69">
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DISSATISFACTION OF SOLDIERS</note><p>The next day Vitellius, after giving audience to the envoys from the Senate 
whom he had ordered to wait for him there, proceeded to the camp, and 
actually bestowed high praise on the loyalty of the soldiers. The auxiliary 
troops loudly complained that such complete impunity, such privileged 
arrogance, was accorded to the legions. The Batavian cohorts were sent back 
to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, lest they should venture on further 
violence. Destiny was thus simultaneously preparing the occasions of civil 
and of foreign war. The Gallic auxiliaries were sent back to their 
respective states, a vast body of men, which in the very earliest stage of 
the revolt had been employed to make an idle show of strength. Besides this, 
in order to eke out the Imperial resources, which had been impaired by a 
series of bounties, directions were given that the battalions of the legions 
and the auxiliary forces should be reduced, all recruiting being forbidden. 
Discharges were offered without distinction. This measure was disastrous to 
the State, and distasteful to the soldier, who found that the same duty was 
distributed among a smaller number, and that his toils and risks came round 
in a more frequent succession. Their vigour too was undermined by luxury, a 
luxury that transgressed our ancient discipline and the customs of our 
ancestors, in whose days the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> found a 
surer foundation in valour than in wealth.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p>Vitellius then directed his course to <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and after witnessing the spectacle exhibited by 
C&aelig;cina, he conceived a desire to visit the plains of <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName> and to survey the scene of the recent victory. 
It was a hideous and terrible sight. Not forty days had passed since the 
battle, and there lay mangled corpses, severed limbs, the putrefying forms 
of men and horses; the soil was saturated with gore, and, what with levelled 
trees and crops, horrible was the desolation. Not less revolting was that 
portion of the road which the people of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> had 
strewed with laurel leaves and roses, and on which they had raised altars, 
and sacrificed victims as if to greet some barbarous despot, festivities in 
which they delighted for the moment, but which were afterwards to work their 
ruin. Valens and C&aelig;cina were present, and pointed out the various 
localities of the field of

battle; shewing how from one point the 
columns of the legions had rushed to the attack; how from another the 
cavalry had charged; how from a third the auxiliary troops had turned the 
flank of the enemy. The tribunes and prefects extolled their individual 
achievements, and mixed together fictions, facts, and exaggerations. The 
common soldiers also turned aside from the line of march with joyful shouts, 
and recognized the various scenes of conflict, and gazed with wonder on the 
piles of weapons and the heaps of slain. Some indeed there were whom all 
this moved to thoughts of the mutability of fortune, to pity, and to tears. 
Vitellius did not turn away his eyes, did not shudder to behold the unburied 
corpses of so many thousands of his countrymen; nay, in his exultation, in 
his ignorance of the doom which was so close upon himself, he actually 
instituted a religious ceremony in honour of the tutelary gods of the 
place.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>A show of gladiators was then 
given by Fabius Valens at <placeName key="perseus,Bononia">Bononia</placeName>, with all the 
arrangements introduced from the capital. The nearer the Emperor approached 
to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the greater was the license of his march, 
accompanied as it was by players and herds of eunuchs, in fact by all that 
had characterised the court of <persName>Nero</persName>. Indeed, Vitellius used to make a 
display of his admiration for <persName>Nero</persName>, and had constantly followed him when he 
sang, not from the compulsion to which the noblest had to yield, but because 
he was the slave and chattel of profligacy and gluttony. To leave some 
months of office open for Valens and C&aelig;cina, the consulates of others 
were abridged, that of Martius Macer was ignored on the ground of his having 
been one of Otho's generals. Valerius Maximus, who had been nominated consul 
by Galba, had his dignity deferred for no offence, but because he was a man 
of gentle temper, and could submit tamely to an affront. Pedanius Costa was 
passed over. The Emperor disliked him because he had risen against Nero, and 
roused Verginius to revolt. Other reasons, however, were alleged. Finally, 
after the servile fashion of the time, thanks were voted to 
Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>A deception, which was 
started with considerable vigour, lasted for a few, and but a few days. 
There had sud-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIUS' GROWING 
INSOLENCE</note>
denly sprung up a man, who gave out that he was 
Scribonianus Camerinus; that, dreading the times of Nero, he had concealed 
himself in <placeName key="tgn,7009395">Histria</placeName>, where the old family of the 
Crassi still had dependants, estates, and a popular name. He admitted into 
the secret of his imposture all the most worthless of his followers; and the 
credulous populace and some of the soldiers, either from not knowing the 
truth, or impatient for revolution, began eagerly to rally round him. When 
he was brought before Vitellius, and asked who he was, as his account of 
himself could not be trusted, and his master recognised him as a runaway 
slave, by name Geta, he was executed as slaves usually are.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>It would almost pass belief, were I to tell to what 
a degree the insolence and sloth of Vitellius grew upon him when messengers 
from <placeName key="1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> 
brought the news that the provinces of the East had sworn allegiance to him. 
Though as yet all information was but vague and uncertain, Vespasian was the 
subject of much talk and rumour, and at the mention of his name Vitellius 
often roused himself. But now, both the Emperor and the army, as if they had 
no rival to fear, indulging in cruelty, lust, and rapine, plunged into all 
the licence of foreign manners.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>Vespasian, on the other hand, was taking a general survey of the chances of 
a campaign and of his resources both immediate and remote. The soldiers were 
so entirely devoted to him, that as he dictated the oath of allegiance and 
prayed for all prosperity to Vitellius, they listened to him in silence. 
Mucianus had no dislike to Vespasian, and was strongly inclined towards 
 <persName>Titus</persName>. Already had Alexander, the governor of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, 
 declared his adhesion. The third legion, as it had passed over from <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, Vespasian 
counted upon as devoted to himself, and it was hoped that the other legions 
of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> would follow its example. In fact the 
whole army had been kindled into indignation by the insolence of the 
soldiers who came among them from Vitellius. Savage in appearance, and 
speaking a rude dialect, they ridiculed every body else as their inferiors. 
But in such gigantic preparations for war there is usually delay. Vespasian 
was at one moment high in hope, and at another disposed to reflect on the 
chances of failure. What

a day would that be when he should 
expose himself with his sixty years upon him, and the two young men, his 
sons, to the perils of war! In private enterprises men may advance or 
recede, and presume more or less upon fortune as they may choose, whereas 
they who aim at empire have no alternative between the highest success and 
utter downfall.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p>The strength of the 
army of <placeName key="7000084">Germany</placeName>, with which as a military man he was 
well acquainted, was continually before his eyes. He reflected that his own 
legions were wholly without experience of a civil war, that those of 
Vitellius had been victorious, and that among the conquered there was more 
dissatisfaction than real strength. Civil strife had shaken the fidelity of 
the Roman soldiery, and danger was to be apprehended from individuals. What 
would be the use of infantry and cavalry, should one or two men seek the 
prize with which the enemy would be ready to reward a prompt act of treason? 
It was thus that Scribonianus had fallen in the days of Claudius, and his 
murderer, Volaginius, had been raised from the ranks to the highest military 
command. It was easier to move the hearts of the multitude than to avoid the 
single assassin.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="76"><p>Though staggered by 
these apprehensions, he was confirmed in his purpose by others among the 
legates and among his own friends, and particularly by Mucianus, who, after 
many conversations with him in private, now publicly addressed him in the 
following terms: "All who enter upon schemes involving great interests, 
should consider whether what they are attempting be for the advantage of the 
State, for their own credit, easy of accomplishment, or at any rate free 
from serious difficulty. They must also weigh the circumstances of their 
adviser, must see whether he will follow up his advice by imperilling 
himself, and must know who, should fortune prosper the undertaking, is to 
have the highest honours. I invite you, Vespasian, to a dignity which will 
be as beneficial to the State, as it will be honourable to yourself. Under 
heaven this dignity lies within your reach. And do not dread what may 
present the semblance of flattery. To be chosen successor to Vitellius would 
be more of an insult than a compliment. It is not against the vigorous 
intellect of the Divine Augustus, it is not against the pro-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">MUCIANUS ENCOURAGES VESPASIAN</note>
found subtlety 
of the aged Tiberius, it is not even against the house of Caius, Claudius, 
or <persName>Nero</persName>, established by a long possession of the Empire, that we are rising 
in revolt. You have already yielded to the prestige even of Galba's family. 
To persist in inaction, and to leave the State to degradation and ruin, 
would look like indolence and cowardice, even supposing that servitude were 
as safe for you as it would be infamous. The time has gone by and passed 
away when you might have endured the suspicion of having coveted Imperial 
power. That power is now your only refuge. Have you forgotten how Corbulo 
was murdered? His origin, I grant, was more illustrious than ours; yet in 
nobility of birth Nero surpassed Vitellius. The man who is afraid sees 
distinction enough in any one whom he fears. That an Emperor can be created 
by the army, Vitellius is himself a proof, who, though he had seen no 
service and had no military reputation, was raised to the throne by the 
unpopularity of Galba. <persName>Otho</persName>, who was overcome, not indeed by skilful 
generalship, or by a powerful enemy, but by his own premature despair, this 
man has made into a great and deservedly regretted Emperor, and all the 
while he is disbanding his legions, disarming his auxiliaries, and sowing 
every day fresh seeds of civil war. All the energy and high spirit which 
once belonged to his army is wasted in the revelry of taverns and in aping 
the debaucheries of their chief. You have from <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, nine fresh legions, unexhausted by battle, 
uncorrupted by dissension; you have a soldiery hardened by habits of warfare 
and victorious over foreign foes; you have strong fleets, auxiliaries both 
horse and foot, kings most faithful to your cause, and an experience in 
which you excel all other men.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="77"><p>"For 
myself I will claim nothing more than not to be reckoned inferior to Valens 
and C&aelig;cina. But do not spurn Mucianus as an associate, because you do 
not find in him a rival. I count myself better than Vitellius; I count you 
better than myself. Your house is ennobled by the glories of a triumph; it 
has two youthful scions, one of whom is already equal to the cares of 
Empire, and in the earliest years of his military career won renown with 
these very armies of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. It would be ridiculous 
in me not to waive my

claims to Empire in favour of the man whose 
son I should adopt, were I myself Emperor. Between us, however, there will 
not be an equal distribution of the fruits of success or failure. If we are 
victorious, I shall have whatever honour you think fit to bestow on me; the 
danger and the peril we shall share alike; nay, I would rather have you, as 
is the better policy, direct your armies, and leave to me the conduct of the 
war and the hazards of battle. At this very moment a stricter discipline 
prevails among the conquered than among the conquerors. The conquered are 
fired to valour by anger, by hatred, by the desire of vengeance, while the 
conquerors are losing their energy in pride and insolence. War will of 
itself discover and lay open the hidden and rankling wounds of the 
victorious party. And, indeed, your vigilance, economy, and wisdom, do not 
inspire me with greater confidence of success than do the indolence, 
ignorance, and cruelty of Vitellius. Once at war, we have a better cause 
than we can have in peace, for those who deliberate on revolt have revolted 
already."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="78"><p>After this speech from 
Mucianus, the other officers crowded round Vespasian with fresh confidence, 
encouraging him, and reminding him of the responses of prophets and the 
movements of the heavenly bodies. Nor was Vespasian proof against this 
superstition, for afterwards, when master of the world, he openly retained 
one Seleucus, an astrologer, to direct his counsels, and to foretell the 
future. Old omens now recurred to his thoughts. A cypress-tree of remarkable 
height on his estate had suddenly fallen, and rising again the following day 
on the very same spot, had flourished with majestic beauty and even broader 
shade. This, as the Haruspices agreed, was an omen of brilliant success, and 
the highest distinction seemed prophesied to Vespasian in early youth. At 
first, however, the honours of a triumph, his consulate, and the glory of 
his victories in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>, appeared to have 
justified the truth of the omen. When he had won these distinctions, he 
began to believe that it portended the Imperial power. Between <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> is <placeName key="tgn,7001405">Mount Carmel</placeName>; this is the name both of the mountain and 
the Deity. They have no image of the god nor any temple; the tradition of 
antiquity recognises only an altar

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">OMENS AND 
ORACLES FAVOR VESPASIAN</note>
and its sacred association. While Vespasian 
was there offering sacrifice and pondering his secret hopes, Basilides the 
priest, after repeated inspections of the entrails, said to him, "Whatever 
be your purposes, Vespasian, whether you think of building a house, of 
enlarging your estate, or augmenting the number of your slaves, there is 
given you a vast habitation, boundless territory, a multitude of men." These 
obscure intimations popular rumour had at once caught up, and now began to 
interpret. Nothing was more talked about by the common people. In 
Vespasian's presence the topic was more frequently discussed, because to the 
aspirant himself men have more to say.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="79"><p>With purposes no longer doubtful they parted, Mucianus for <placeName key="perseus,Antioch,Phrygia">Antioch</placeName>, Vespasian for <placeName key="tgn,7001363">C&aelig;sarea</placeName>. These cities are the capitals of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> 
respectively. The initiative in transferring the Empire to Vespasian was 
taken at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> under the prompt direction of 
Tiberius Alexander, who on the 1st of July made the legions swear allegiance 
to him. That day was ever after celebrated as the first of his reign, though 
the army of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> on July 3rd took the oath to 
Vespasian in person with such eager alacrity that they would not wait for 
the return of his son Titus, who was then on his way back from <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, acting as the medium between Mucianus and his 
father for the communication of their plans. All this was done by the 
impulsive action of the soldiers without the preliminary of a formal 
harangue or any concentration of the legions.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="80"><p>While they were seeking a suitable time and place, and for that 
which in such an affair is the great difficulty, the first man to speak, 
while hope, fear, the chances of success or of disaster, were present to 
their minds, one day, on Vespasian quitting his chamber, a few soldiers who 
stood near, in the usual form in which they would salute their legate, 
suddenly saluted him as Emperor. Then all the rest hurried up, called him 
C&aelig;sar and Augustus, and heaped on him all the titles of Imperial rank. 
Their minds had passed from apprehension to confidence of success. In 
Vespasian there appeared no sign of elation or arrogance, or of any change 
arising from his changed fortunes. As soon as he had dispelled the mist with 
which so astonishing a vicissi-

tude had clouded his vision, he 
addressed the troops in a soldier-like style, and listened to the joyful 
intelligence that came pouring in from all quarters. This was the very 
opportunity for which Mucianus had been waiting. He now at once administered 
to the eager soldiers the oath of allegiance to Vespasian. Then he entered 
the theatre at <placeName key="perseus,Antioch,Phrygia">Antioch</placeName>, where it is customary for 
the citizens to hold their public deliberations, and as they crowded 
together with profuse expressions of flattery, he addressed them. He could 
speak Greek with considerable grace, and in all that he did and said he had 
the art of displaying himself to advantage. Nothing excited the provincials 
and the army so much as the assertion of Mucianus that Vitellius had 
determined to remove the legions of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, to an easy and lucrative service, while the 
armies of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> were to have given them in exchange 
the encampments of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> with their inclement 
climate and their harassing toils. On the one hand, the provincials from 
long use felt a pleasure in the companionship of the soldiers, with whom 
many of them were connected by friendship or relationship; on the other, the 
soldiers from the long duration of their service loved the well-known and 
familiar camp as a home.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="81"><p>Before the 
15th of July the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> had adopted the same 
allegiance. There joined him, each with his entire kingdom, Sohemus, who had 
no contemptible army, and Antiochus, who possessed vast ancestral wealth, 
and was the richest of all the subject-kings. Before long Agrippa, who had 
been summoned from the capital by secret despatches from his friends, while 
as yet Vitellius knew nothing, was crossing the sea with all speed. Queen 
Berenice too, who was then in the prime of youth and beauty, and who had 
charmed even the old Vespasian by the splendour of her presents, promoted 
his cause with equal zeal. All the provinces washed by the sea, as far as 
 <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, and the 
 whole expanse of country inland towards <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> and 
 <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, took the oath of allegiance. The legates, 
however, of these provinces were without troops, <rs type="placename">Cappadocia</rs> as yet having had no legions assigned to it. 
 A council was held at <placeName key="tgn,7002857">Berytus</placeName> to deliberate on the 
general conduct of the war. Thither came Mucianus with the legates

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">EAST PROCLAIMS VESPASIAN EMPEROR</note>
and tribunes 
and all the most distinguished centurions and soldiers, and thither also the 
picked troops of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>. Such a 
vast assemblage of cavalry and infantry, and the pomp of the kings that 
strove to rival each other in magnificence, presented an appearance of 
Imperial splendour.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="82"><p>The first 
business of the campaign was to levy troops and recall the veterans to 
service. The strong cities were set apart for the manufacture of arms; at 
<placeName key="perseus,Antioch,Phrygia">Antioch</placeName> gold and silver money was coined, every 
thing being vigorously carried on in its appointed place by properly 
qualified agents. Vespasian himself went everywhere, urged to exertion, 
encouraged the industrious by praise, and with the indolent used the 
stimulus of example rather than of compulsion, and chose to be blind to the 
faults rather than to the merits of his friends. Many among them he 
distinguished with prefectures and governments, and several with the honours 
of senatorial rank; all these were men of eminence who soon reached the 
highest positions. In some cases good fortune served instead of merit. Of a 
donative to the troops Mucianus in his first speech had held out only 
moderate hopes, and even Vespasian offered no more in the civil war than 
others had done in times of peace, thus making a noble stand against all 
bribery of the soldiery, and possessing in consequence a better army. Envoys 
were sent to <rs type="placename">Parthia</rs> and <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, and precautions were taken that, when the 
legions were engaged in the civil war, the country in their rear might not 
be exposed to attack. It was arranged that Titus should pursue the war in 
 <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>, while Vespasian should secure the 
 passes into <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. To cope with Vitellius, a portion 
of the army, the generalship of Mucianus, the prestige of Vespasian's name, 
and the destiny before which all difficulties vanish, seemed sufficient. To 
all the armies and legates letters were despatched, and instructions were 
given to them that they were to attach the pr&aelig;torians, who hated 
Vitellius, by the inducement of renewed military service.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="83"><p>Mucianus, who acted more as a colleague than as a 
servant of the Emperor, moved on with some light-armed troops, not indeed at 
a tardy pace so as to give the appear-

ance of delay, yet not 
with extraordinary speed. Thus he allowed rumour to gather fresh strength by 
distance, well aware that his force was but small, and that exaggerated 
notions are formed about what is not seen. Behind him, however, came in a 
vast body the 6th legion and 13,000 veterans. He had given directions that 
the fleet from the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> should be brought up to 
<placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, not having yet made up his mind, whether, 
 avoiding <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, he should move on <placeName key="tgn,7006426">Dyrrachium</placeName> with his infantry and cavalry, and at the 
same time blockade the sea on the side of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with 
 his ships of war, thus leaving <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> safe in his rear, which, being bare of troops, 
would be left at the mercy of Vitellius, unless they were occupied with 
proper garrisons. And thus too Vitellius himself, finding <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundisium</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, and the 
 shores of <placeName key="tgn,7007850">Calabria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7004610">Lucania</placeName> menaced by hostile fleets, would be in utter 
perplexity as to which part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> he should 
protect.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="84"><p>Thus the provinces echoed 
with the bustle of preparing fleets, armies, and the implements of war. 
Nothing, however, was so vexatious as the raising of money. Mucianus with 
the perpetual assertion that money was the sinews of war, looked in all 
questions, not to right or truth, but only to the extent of a man's fortune. 
Informations abounded, and all the richest men were fastened on for plunder. 
These intolerable oppressions, which yet found some excuse in the 
necessities of war, were continued even in peace. Vespasian himself indeed 
at the beginning of his reign was not so bent on enforcing these iniquitous 
measures, till, spoilt by prosperity and evil counsellors, he learnt this 
policy and ventured to use it. Mucianus contributed to the war even from his 
own purse, liberal with his private means because he helped himself without 
scruple from the wealth of the State. The rest followed his example in 
contributing their money; very few enjoyed the same licence in reimbursing 
themselves.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="85"><p>Meanwhile the operations 
 of Vespasian were hastened by the zeal of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, which had come over to his side. The third 
 legion set the example to the other legions of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>. These were the eighth and seventh 
(Claudius's), who were possessed with a strong liking for
 
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VESPASIAN'S PREPARATIONS FOR WAR</note>
<persName>Otho</persName>, though they had not 
been present at the battle of <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>. They had 
advanced to <placeName key="perseus,Aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, and by roughly repulsing the 
messengers who brought the tidings of Otho's defeat, by tearing the colours 
which displayed the name of Vitellius, by finally seizing on the military 
chest and dividing it among themselves, had assumed a hostile attitude. Then 
they began to fear; fear suggested a new thought, that acts might be made a 
merit of with Vespasian, which would have to be excused to Vitellius. 
Accordingly, the three legions of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> sought 
 by letter to win over the army of <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, and 
prepared to use force if they refused. During this commotion, Aponius 
Saturnius, governor of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, ventured on a 
most atrocious act. He despatched a centurion to murder Tettius Julianus, 
the legate of the 7th legion, to gratify a private pique, which he concealed 
beneath the appearance of party zeal. Julianus, having discovered his 
danger, and procured some guides, who were acquainted with the country, fled 
through the pathless wastes of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> beyond 
<placeName>Mount Hamus</placeName>, nor did he afterwards take any part in 
the civil war. He set out to join Vespasian, but contrived to protract his 
journey by various pretexts, lingering or hastening on his way, according to 
the intelligence he received.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="86"><p>In <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, however, the 13th legion and the 7th 
(Galba's), which still retained their vexation and rage at the defeat of <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, joined Vespasian without hesitation, mainly 
under the influence of Primus Antonius. This man, though an offender against 
the law, and convicted of fraud in the reign of Nero, had, among the other 
calamities of war, recovered his rank as a Senator. Having been appointed by 
Galba to command the 7th legion, he was commonly believed to have often 
written to Otho, offering the party his services as a general. Being 
slighted, however, by that Prince, he found no employment during the war. 
When the fortunes of Vitellius began to totter, he attached himself to 
Vespasian, and brought a vast accession of strength to his party. He was 
brave in battle, ready of speech, dexterous in bringing odium upon other 
men, powerful amidst civil strife and rebellion, rapacious, prodigal, the 
worst of citizens in peace, but in war no contemptible ally. United by

  these means, the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> and 
  <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName> drew with them the soldiery of <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName>, though the consular legates took no part in 
  the movement. Titus Ampius Flavianus was the governor of <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, Popp&aelig;us Silvanus of <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName>. They were both rich and advanced in years. The 
Imperial procurator, however, was Cornelius Fuscus, a man in the prime of 
life and of illustrious birth. Though in early youth the desire of repose 
had led him to resign his senatorial rank, he afterwards put himself at the 
head of his colony in fighting for Galba, and by this service he obtained 
his procuratorship. Subsequently embracing the cause of Vespasian, he lent 
the movement the stimulus of a fiery zeal. Finding his pleasure not so much 
in the rewards of peril as in peril itself, to assured and long acquired 
possession he preferred novelty, uncertainty, and risk. Accordingly, both he 
and Antonius strove to agitate and disturb wherever there was any weak 
point. Despatches were sent to the 14th legion in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> and to the 1st in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, 
for both these legions had been on the side of Otho against Vitellius. 
Letters too were scattered through every part of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and in a moment a mighty war burst into flame, for 
  the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> were already in open revolt, 
and the rest were waiting only the signal of success.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="87"><p>While Vespasian and the generals of his party were 
thus occupied in the provinces, Vitellius was daily becoming more 
contemptible and indolent, halting to enjoy the pleasures of every town and 
villa in his way, as with his cumbrous host he advanced towards the capital. 
He was followed by 60,000 armed soldiers demoralized by licence. Still 
larger was the number of camp-followers; and of all slaves, the slaves of 
soldiers are the most unruly. So numerous a retinue of officers and personal 
friends would have been difficult to keep under restraint, even if 
controlled by the strictest discipline. The crowd was made more unwieldy by 
Senators and Knights who came to meet him from the capital, some moved by 
fear, many by a spirit of adulation, others, and by degrees all, that they 
might not be left behind while the rest were going. From the dregs of the 
people there thronged buffoons, players, and charioteers, known to Vitellius 
from their infamous compliance with his vices;

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">VESPASIAN ACKNOWLEDGED IN <placeName key="tgn,7016532">ADRIATIC</placeName></note>
for in such disgraceful friendships he 
felt a strange pleasure. And now not only were the colonies and towns 
exhausted by having to furnish supplies, but the very cultivator of the soil 
and his lands, on which the harvests were now ripe, were plundered like an 
enemy's territory.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="88"><p>There were many 
sanguinary encounters between the soldiers; for ever since the mutiny which 
broke out at <placeName key="tgn,7006026">Ticinum</placeName> there had lingered a spirit of 
dissension between the legions and the auxiliary troops, though they could 
unite whenever they had to fight with the rustic population. The most 
terrible massacre took place at the 7th milestone from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Vitellius was distributing to each soldier 
provisions ready dressed on the same abundant scale as the gladiators' 
rations, and the populace had poured forth, and spread themselves throughout 
the entire camp. Some with the frolicsome humour of slaves robbed the 
careless soldiers by slily cutting their belts, and then asked them whether 
they were armed. Unused to insult, the spirit of the soldiers resented the 
jest. Sword in hand they fell upon the unarmed people. Among the slain was 
the father of a soldier, who was with his son. He was afterwards recognised, 
and his murder becoming generally known, they spared the innocent crowd. Yet 
there was a panic at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, as the soldiers pressed 
on in all directions. It was to the forum that they chiefly directed their 
steps, anxious to behold the spot where Galba had fallen. Nor were the men 
themselves a less frightful spectacle, bristling as they were with the skins 
of wild beasts, and armed with huge lances, while in their strangeness to 
the place they were embarrassed by the crowds of people, or tumbling down in 
the slippery streets or from the shock of some casual encounter, they fell 
to quarrelling, and then had recourse to blows and the use of their swords. 
Besides, the tribunes and prefects were hurrying to and fro with formidable 
bodies of armed men.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="89"><p>Vitellius 
himself, mounted on a splendid charger, with military cloak and sword, 
advanced from the Mulvian bridge, driving the Senate and people before him; 
but deterred by the advice of his friends from marching into <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> as if it were a captured city, he assumed a civil 
garb, and proceeded with his army in orderly array. The eagles of

four legions were borne in front, and an equal number of colours from 
other legions on either side, then came the standards of twelve auxiliary 
squadrons, and the cavalry behind the ranks of the infantry. Next came 
thirty-four auxiliary cohorts, distinguished according to the names or 
various equipments of the nations. Before each eagle were the prefects of 
the camp, the tribunes, and the centurions of highest rank, in white robes, 
and the other officers by the side of their respective companies, glittering 
with arms and decorations. The ornaments and chains of the soldiers 
presented a brilliant appearance. It was a glorious sight, and the army was 
worthy of a better Emperor than Vitellius. Thus he entered the capital, and 
he there embraced his mother and honoured her with the title of 
<placeName key="perseus,Augusta">Augusta</placeName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="90"><p>The next day, as if he were 
addressing the Senate and people of another State, he pronounced a high 
panegyric on himself, extolling his own energy and moderation, though his 
enormities were known to the very persons who were present and to the whole 
of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, his progress through which had been 
disgraced by sloth and profligacy. Yet the mob, who had no patriotic 
anxieties, and who, without distinguishing between truth and falsehood, had 
learnt the lesson of habitual flattery, applauded him with shouts and 
acclamations, and, reluctant as he was to assume the name of Augustus, 
extorted from him a compliance as idle as his previous refusal.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="91"><p>The country, ready to find a meaning in 
every circumstance, regarded it as an omen of gloomy import that Vitellius, 
on obtaining the office of supreme Pontiff, should have issued a 
proclamation concerning the public religious ceremonial on the 18th of July, 
a day which from old times the disasters of <placeName>Cremera</placeName> 
and <rs type="placename">Allia</rs> had marked as unlucky. Thus utterly 
regardless of all law human and divine, with freedmen and friends as 
reckless as himself, he lived as if he were among a set of drunkards. Still 
at the consular elections he was present in company with the candidates like 
an ordinary citizen, and by shewing himself as a spectator in the theatre, 
as a partisan in the circus, he courted every breath of applause from the 
lowest rabble. Agreeable and popular as this conduct would have been, had it 
been

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIUS ENTERS <placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName></note>
prompted by noble qualities, it was looked 
upon as undignified and contemptible from the remembrance of his past life. 
He habitually appeared in the Senate even when unimportant matters were 
under discussion; and it once happened that Priscus Helvidius, the 
pr&aelig;tor elect, had spoken against his wishes. Though at the moment 
provoked, he only called on the tribunes of the people to support his 
insulted authority, and then, when his friends, who feared his resentment 
was deeper than it appeared, sought to appease him, he replied that it was 
nothing strange that two senators in a Commonwealth should disagree: he had 
himself been in the habit of opposing Thrasea. Most of them laughed at the 
effrontery of such a comparison, though some were pleased at the very 
circumstance of his having selected, not one of the most influential men of 
the time, but Thrasea, as his model of true glory.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="92"><p>He had advanced to the command of the 
Pr&aelig;torian Guard Publius Sabinus, a prefect of the cohort, and Julius 
Priscus, then only a centurion. It was through the influence of C&aelig;cina 
and Valens that they respectively rose to power. Though always at variance, 
these two men left no authority to Vitellius. The functions of Empire were 
discharged by C&aelig;cina and Valens. They had long before been led to 
suspect each other by animosities scarcely concealed amid the cares of the 
campaign and the camp, and aggravated by unprincipled friends and a state of 
society calculated to produce such feuds. In their struggles for popularity, 
in their long retinues, and in the vast crowds at their levees, they vied 
with each other and challenged comparison, while the favour of Vitellius 
inclined first to one, and then to the other. There can never be complete 
confidence in a power which is excessive. Vitellius himself, who was ever 
varying between sudden irritation and unseasonable fondness, they at once 
despised and feared. Still this had not made them less keen to seize on 
palaces and gardens and all the wealth of the Empire, while a sad and needy 
throng of nobles, whom with their children Galba had restored to their 
country, received no relief from the compassion of the Emperor. By an edict 
which gratified the leading men of the State, while it approved itself even 
to the populace, Vitellius gave

back to the returned exiles their 
rights over their freedmen, although servile ingenuity sought in every way 
to neutralise the boon, concealing money in quarters which either obscurity 
or rank rendered secure. Some freedmen had made their way into the palace of 
the Emperor, and thus became more powerful even than their patrons.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="93"><p>Meanwhile the soldiers, as their numbers 
overflowed the crowded camp, dispersed throughout the porticoes, the 
temples, and the whole capital, did not know their own headquarters, kept no 
watch, and ceased to brace themselves by toil. Amidst the allurements of the 
city and all shameful excesses, they wasted their strength in idleness, and 
their energies in riot. At last, reckless even of health, a large portion of 
them quartered themselves in the notoriously pestilential neighbourhood of 
the <placeName key="tgn,7001168">Vatican</placeName>; hence ensued a great mortality in the ranks. The <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> was close at hand, and their extreme eagerness for 
the water and their impatience of the heat weakened the constitutions of the 
Germans and Gauls, always liable to disease. To make matters worse, the 
organisation of the service was deranged by unprincipled intrigue and 
favour. Sixteen Pr&aelig;torian and four city cohorts were being raised, 
each to consist of a thousand men. In this levy Valens ventured to do more 
than his rival on the pretence of his having rescued C&aelig;cina himself 
from peril. Doubtless his arrival had restored the fortunes of the party, 
and his victory had reversed the unfavourable rumours occasioned by his 
tardy advance The entire army too of <placeName key="7000084">Lower Germany</placeName> 
was attached to him; this circumstance, it is thought, first made the 
allegiance of C&aelig;cina waver.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="94"><p>Much however as Vitellius indulged his generals, his soldiers enjoyed yet 
greater licence. Every one chose his own service. However unfit, he might, 
if he preferred it, be enrolled among the soldiers of the capital. Soldiers 
again of good character were allowed, if they so wished, to remain with the 
legions, or in the cavalry; and this was the choice of many who were worn 
out with disease, or who shrank from the unhealthiness of the climate. But 
the main strength of the legions and cavalry was drafted from them, while 
the old glory of the Pr&aelig;torian camp was destroyed by these

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">HIS ARMY DEMORALIZED</note>
20,000 men 
indiscriminately taken rather than chosen out of the whole army. While 
Vitellius was haranguing the troops, the men called out for the execution of 
Asiaticus, and of Flavius and Rufinus, the Gallic chieftains, because they 
had fought for <persName>Vindex</persName>. He never checked these cries: for to say nothing of 
the cowardice natural to that feeble soul, he was aware that the 
distribution of a donative was imminent, and, having no money, he lavished 
every thing else on the soldiers. A contribution in the form of a tax was 
exacted from the freedmen of former Emperors in proportion to the number of 
their slaves. Vitellius himself, thinking only how to squander, was building 
a stable for his charioteers, was filling the circus with shows of 
gladiators and wild beasts, and fooling away his money as if he had the most 
abundant supplies.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="95"><p>Moreover 
C&aelig;cina and Valens celebrated the birthday of Vitellius by exhibiting 
in every quarter of the city shows of gladiators on a vast and hitherto 
unparalleled scale. He pleased the most infamous characters, but utterly 
disgusted all the respectable citizens, by building altars in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, and performing funeral rites to <persName>Nero</persName>. 
Victims were slaughtered and burnt in the name of the State; the pile was 
kindled by the Augustales, an order of the priesthood dedicated by the 
Emperor Tiberius to the Julian family, just as <persName>Romulus</persName> had dedicated one to 
king Tatius. Within four months from the victory of <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, Asiaticus, the emperor's freedman, was 
rivalling the Polycleti, the Patrobii, and all the old hateful names. No one 
sought promotion in that court by integrity or diligence; the sole road to 
power was to glut the insatiable appetites of Vitellius by prodigal 
entertainments, extravagance, and riot. The Emperor himself, thinking it 
enough to enjoy the present, and without a thought for the future, is 
believed to have squandered nine hundred million sesterces in a very few 
months. <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, as miserable as she was great, 
afflicted in one year by an <persName>Otho</persName> and a Vitellius, what with the Vinii, the 
Fabii, the Iceli, and the Asiatici, passed through all vicissitudes of 
infamy, till there came Mucianus and Marcellus, and different men rather 
than a different morality.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="96"><p>The first 
revolt of which Vitellius received tidings

was that of the 3rd 
legion, despatches having been sent by Aponius Saturninus before he too 
attached himself to the party of Vespasian. Aponius, however, agitated by 
the unexpected occurrence, had not written all the particulars, and 
flattering friends softened down its import. "It was," they said, "a mutiny 
of only a single legion; the loyalty of the other armies was unshaken." 
Vitellius in addressing the soldiers spoke to the same effect. He inveighed 
against the lately disbanded Pr&aelig;torians, and asserted that false 
rumours were circulated by them, and that there was no fear of a civil war. 
The name of Vespasian he suppressed, and soldiers were dispersed through the 
city to check the popular gossip. This more than anything else kept these 
rumours alive.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="97"><p>Nevertheless Vitellius 
 summoned auxiliary troops from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, tardily, 
however, and with an attempt to conceal his necessities. The legates and the 
provinces were equally slow. Hordeonius Flaccus, who was beginning to 
suspect the Batavians, feared that he should have a war on his own hands, 
and Vettius Bolanus had in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> a province never 
very quiet; and both these officers were wavering in their allegiance. <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> too, which then was without a governor of consular 
rank, showed no alacrity. The legates of the three legions, equal in 
authority, and ready, while Vitellius was prosperous, to vie in obedience, 
stood aloof with one consent from his falling fortunes. In <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, the legion, and the auxiliary infantry levied by 
Clodius Macer and soon after disbanded by Galba, again entered the service 
at the order of Vitellius, while all the rest of the youth promptly gave in 
their names. Vitellius had ruled that province as proconsul with integrity 
and popularity; Vespasian's government had been infamous and odious. The 
allies formed conjectures accordingly as to the manner in which each would 
reign, but the result contradicted them.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="98"><p>At first Valerius Festus, the legate, loyally seconded the zeal 
of the provincials. Soon he began to waver, supporting Vitellius in his 
public dispatches and edicts, Vespasian in his secret correspondence, and 
intending to hold by the one or the other according as they might succeed. 
Some soldiers and centurions, coming through <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName> and

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">REINFORCEMENTS FROM PROVINCES</note>
<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, 
were seized with letters and edicts from Vespasian, and on being sent to 
Vitellius were put to death. More, however, eluded discovery, escaping 
either through the faithful protection of friends or by their own tact. Thus 
the preparations of Vitellius became known, while the plans of Vespasian 
were for the most part kept secret. At first the supineness of Vitellius was 
in fault; afterwards the occupation of the <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonian 
Alps</placeName> with troops stopped all intelligence. And on the sea the prevalent 
Etesian winds favoured an eastward voyage, but hindered all return.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="99"><p>At length Vitellius, appalled by the 
irruption of the enemy and by the menacing intelligence from every quarter, 
ordered C&aelig;cina and Valens to take the field. C&aelig;cina was sent on 
in advance; Valens, who was just recovering from a severe illness, was 
delayed by weakness. Far different was the appearance of the <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> army as it marched out of the capital. All 
strength had departed from their bodies, all energy from their spirits. 
Slowly, and with thin ranks, the column moved along, their weapons feebly 
grasped, their horses spiritless. The soldiers, impatient of the heat, the 
dust, and the weather, in proportion as they were less capable of enduring 
toil, were more ready for mutiny. All this was aggravated by the old vanity 
of C&aelig;cina, and by the indolence that had of late crept over him; 
presuming on the excessive favour of fortune, he had abandoned himself to 
luxury. Perhaps he meditated perfidy, and it was part of his policy to 
enervate the courage of the army. Many believe that his fidelity had been 
shaken by the suggestions of Flavius Sabinus, who employed Rubrius Gallus as 
the bearer of communications intimating that the conditions of desertion 
would be held binding by Vespasian. At the same time he was reminded of his 
hatred and jealously of Fabius Valens. Being inferior to his rival in 
influence with Vitellius, he should seek to secure favour and power with the 
new Emperor.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="100"><p>100. C&aelig;cina, having 
embraced Vitellius and received tokens of high distinction, left him, and 
sent a detachment of cavalry to occupy <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. It 
was followed by the veteran troops of the 4th, 10th, and 16th legions, by 
the 5th and 22nd legions, and the rear was brought up by the 21st

(the Rapax) and the first Italian legion with the veteran troops of 
three British legions, and a chosen body of auxiliaries. After the departure 
of C&aelig;cina, Valens sent a despatch to the army which had been under his 
own command with directions that it should wait for him on the road; such, 
he said, was his arrangement with C&aelig;cina. C&aelig;cina, however, being 
with the army in person, and consequently having greater influence, 
pretended that this plan had been changed, that so the gathering forces of 
the enemy might be met with their whole strength. Orders were therefore 
given to the legions to advance with all speed upon <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, while a portion of the force was to proceed to 
 <placeName key="tgn,7005892">Hostilia</placeName>. C&aelig;cina himself turned aside to <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName>, on the pretext that he wished to address the 
fleet. Soon, however, he sought the retirement of <placeName key="perseus,Patavium">Patavium</placeName>, there to concert his treachery. Lucilius 
Bassus, who had been promoted by Vitellius from the command of a squadron of 
cavalry to be admiral of the fleets at <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName> and 
<placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName>, failing immediately to obtain the command 
of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard, sought to gratify his unreasonable resentment 
by an atrocious act of perfidy. It cannot be certainly known whether he 
carried C&aelig;cina with him, or whether (as is often the case with bad 
men, that they are like each other) both were actuated by the same evil 
motives.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="101"><p>101. The historians of the 
period, who during the ascendancy of the Flavian family composed the 
chronicles of this war, have in the distorted representations of flattery 
assigned as the motives of these men a regard for peace and a love of their 
country. For my own part I believe that, to say nothing of a natural 
fickleness and an honour which they must have held cheap after the betrayal 
of Galba, feelings of rivalry, and jealousy lest others should outstrip them 
in the favour of Vitellius, made them accomplish his ruin. C&aelig;cina, 
having overtaken the legions, strove by every species of artifice to 
undermine the fidelity of the centurions and soldiers, who were devoted to 
Vitellius. Bassus, in making the same attempt, experienced less difficulty, 
for the fleet, remembering how recently it had served in the cause of <persName>Otho</persName>, 
was ready to change its allegiance.</p></div2></div1>

 <div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>UNDER happier auspices and in a more loyal spirit the 
Flavianist leaders were discussing the plans of the campaign. They had 
assembled at <placeName key="tgn,7015127">Petovio</placeName>, the winter-quarters of the 
13th legion. There they debated, whether they should blockade the passes of 
the <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonian Alps</placeName> till the whole strength of their 
party should be gathered in their rear, or whether it would be the more 
vigorous policy to close with the enemy, and to contend for the possession 
of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Those who thought it advisable to wait for 
reinforcements, and to protract the campaign, dwelt on the strength and 
reputation of the German legions. "Vitellius," they said, "has now joined 
them with the flower of the British army. Our numbers are not even equal to 
those of the legions whom they lately defeated; and the conquered, let them 
talk as fiercely as they will, lose something of their courage. But, if we 
occupy meanwhile the passes of the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, Mucianus 
will come up with the forces of the East. Vespasian has in addition the 
command of the sea, his fleets, and provinces loyal to his cause, in which 
he may collect the vast materials for what may be called another war. A 
salutary delay will bring us new forces, while we shall lose nothing of what 
we have."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>In answer to this, Antonius 
Primus, who was the most energetic promoter of the war, declared that prompt 
action would be advantageous to themselves, and fatal to Vitellius. 
"Supineness," he said, "rather than confidence has grown upon the 
conquerors. They are not even kept under arms or within camps. In every town 
of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, sunk in sloth, formidable only to their 
entertainers, they have drunk of unaccustomed pleasures with an eagerness 
equal to the rudeness of their former life. They have been emasculated 
by

the circus, the theatre, and the allurements of the capital, 
or they are worn out with sickness. Yet even to these men, if you give them 
time, their old vigour will return with the preparation for war. <placeName key="7000084">Germany</placeName>, whence their strength is drawn, is not far 
 away; <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> is separated only by a strait; the 
provinces of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="1000095">Spain</placeName> 
are near; on either side they can find troops, horses, tribute; they have 
<placeName key="1000080">Italy</placeName> itself, and the resources of the capital, and, 
should they choose themselves to take the offensive, they have two fleets, 
and the <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyrian sea</placeName> open to them. What good then 
will our mountain-passes do us? What will be the use of having protracted 
the war into another summer? Where are we to find in the meanwhile money and 
supplies? Why not rather avail ourselves of the fact that the legions of <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, which were cheated rather than vanquished, are 
 hastening to rise again for vengeance, and that the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> have brought us their unimpaired strength? 
If you reckon the number of soldiers, rather than that of legions, we have 
greater strength, and no vices, for our very humiliation has been most 
helpful to our discipline. As for the cavalry, they were not vanquished even 
on that day; though the fortune of war was against them, they penetrated the 
Vitellianist lines. Two squadrons of M&oelig;sian and Pannonian cavalry then 
broke through the enemy; now the united standards of sixteen squadrons will 
bury and overwhelm with the crash and din and storm of their onset these 
horses and horsemen that have forgotten how to fight. Unless any one hinders 
me, I who suggest will execute the plan. You, whose fortune never suffered a 
reverse, may keep back the legions; the light cohorts will be enough for me. 
Before long you will hear that <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> has been 
opened, and the power of Vitellius shaken. You will be delighted to follow, 
and to tread in the footsteps of victory."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>With flashing eyes, and in the fierce tones that might be most 
widely heard (for the centurions and some of the common soldiers had 
intruded themselves into the deliberations), he poured out such a torrent of 
these and similar words, that he carried away even the cautious and prudent, 
while the general voice of the multitude extolled him as the one man, the 
one general in the army, and spurned the in-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">FLAVIANIST DELIBERATIONS</note>
action of the others. He had 
raised this reputation for himself at the very first assembly, when, after 
Vespasian's letters had been read, he had not, like many, used ambiguous 
language, on which he might put this or that construction as might serve his 
purpose. It was seen that he openly committed himself to the cause, and he 
had therefore greater weight with the soldiers, as being associated with 
them in what was either their crime or their glory.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>Next to Primus in influence was Cornelius Fuscus, the 
procurator. He also had been accustomed to inveigh mercilessly against 
Vitellius, and had thus left himself no hope in the event of defeat. T. 
Ampius Flavianus, disposed to caution by natural temperament and advanced 
years, excited in the soldiers a suspicion that he still remembered his 
relationship to Vitellius; and as he had fled when the movement in the 
legions began, and had then voluntarily returned, it was believed that he 
had sought an opportunity for treachery. Flavianus indeed had left <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, and had entered <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, 
and was out of the way of danger, when his desire for revolution urged him 
to resume the title of Legate, and to take part in the civil strife. 
Cornelius Fuscus had advised him to this course, not that he needed the 
talents of Flavianus, but wishing that a consular name might clothe with its 
high prestige the very first movements of the party.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>Still, that the passage into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> might be safe and advantageous, directions were 
 sent to Aponius Saturninus to hasten up with the armies of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>. That the provinces might not be exposed 
without defence to the barbarian tribes, the princes of the Sarmat&aelig; 
Iazyges, who had in their hands the government of that nation, were enrolled 
in the army. These chiefs also offered the service of their people, and its 
force of cavalry, their only effective troops; but the offer was declined, 
lest in the midst of civil strife they should attempt some hostile 
enterprise, or, influenced by higher offers from other quarters, should cast 
off all sense of right and duty. Sido and Italicus, kings of the Suevi, were 
brought over to the cause. Their loyalty to the Roman people was of long 
standing, and their nation was more faithful than the other to any trust 
reposed in them. On the flank of the army were posted some auxiliaries, for 
 <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName> was

hostile, Portius 
Septimius, the procurator, remaining incorruptibly faithful to Vitellius. 
Accordingly, Sextilius Felix with Aurius' Horse, eight cohorts, and the 
native levies of <placeName>Noricum</placeName>, was sent to occupy the 
 bank of the river <placeName key="tgn,7007528">&AElig;nus</placeName>, which flows between 
 <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName> and <placeName>Noricum</placeName>. 
Neither hazarded an engagement, and the fate of the two parties was decided 
elsewhere.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>Antonius, as he hurried with 
the veteran soldiers of the cohorts and part of the cavalry to invade <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, was accompanied by Arrius Varus, an energetic 
 soldier. Service under Corbulo, and successes in <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, had gained for him this reputation; yet it was 
generally said, that in secret conversations with <persName>Nero</persName> he had calumniated 
Corbulo's high qualities. The favour thus infamously acquired made him a 
centurion of the first rank, yet the ill-gotten prosperity of the moment 
afterwards turned to his destruction. <persName>Primus</persName> and Varus, having occupied <placeName key="perseus,Aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, were joyfully welcomed in the neighbourhood, 
and in the towns of <placeName key="perseus,Opitergium">Opitergium</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Altinum">Altinum</placeName>. At <placeName key="perseus,Altinum">Altinum</placeName> a force was 
left to oppose the <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName> fleet, the defection of 
which from Vitellius was not yet known. They next attached to their party 
 <placeName key="perseus,Patavium">Patavium</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003070">Ateste</placeName>. There 
they learnt that three cohorts, belonging to Vitellius, and the Sebonian 
Horse had taken up a position at the <placeName>Forum Alieni</placeName>, where they had thrown a 
bridge across the river. It was determined to seize the opportunity of 
attacking this force, unprepared as it was; for this fact had likewise been 
communicated. Coming upon them at dawn, they killed many before they could 
arm. Orders had been given to slay but few, and to constrain the rest by 
fear to transfer their allegiance. Some indeed at once surrendered, but the 
greater part broke down the bridge, and thus cut off the advance of the 
pursuing enemy.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>When this success 
became known, two legions, the seventh (Galba's) and the eighteenth (the 
Gemina), finding the campaign opening in favour of the Flavianists, repaired 
with alacrity to <placeName key="perseus,Patavium">Patavium</placeName> under the command of 
Vedius Aquila the legate. A few days were there taken for rest, and Minucius 
Justus, prefect of the camp in the 7th legion, who ruled with more 
strictness than a civil war will permit, was withdrawn from the exasperated 
soldiery, and sent to Ves-

pasian. An act that had been long desired 
was taken by a flattering construction for more than it was worth, when 
Antonius gave orders that the statues of Galba, which had been thrown down 
during the troubles of the times, should be restored in all the towns. It 
would, he supposed, reflect honour on the cause, if it were thought that 
they had been friendly to Galba's rule, and that his party was again rising 
into strength.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>The next question was, 
what place should be selected as the seat of war. <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> seemed the most eligible, surrounded as it was 
with open plains, suitable for the action of cavalry, in which they were 
very strong. At the same time it was thought that in wresting from Vitellius 
a colony so rich in resources there would be both profit and glory. They 
secured <placeName key="perseus,Vicetia">Vicetia</placeName> by simply passing through it. Though 
in itself a small gain, for the town is but of moderate strength, it was 
considered an important advantage when they reflected that in this town 
C&aelig;cina was born, and that, the general of the enemy had lost his 
native place. The people of <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> were a valuable 
aid; they served the cause by the example of their zeal and by their wealth, 
and the army thus occupied a position between <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName> and the Julian 
Alps. It was to cut off all passage at this point from the armies of 
<placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> that they had barred this route. All this 
was done either without the knowledge, or against the commands of Vespasian. 
He gave orders that the army should halt at <placeName key="perseus,Aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> 
and there await Mucianus; and these orders he supported by the argument, 
that as <placeName key="tgn,7016833">&AElig;gypt</placeName>, which commanded the corn 
supplies, and the revenues of the wealthiest provinces were in his hands, 
the army of Vitellius would be compelled to capitulate from the want of pay 
and provisions. Mucianus in frequent letters advised the same policy; a 
victory that should cost neither blood nor tears, and other objects of the 
kind, were his pretexts; but in truth he was greedy of glory, and anxious to 
keep the whole credit of the war to himself. Owing, however, to the vast 
distances, the advice came only after the matter was decided.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Then Antonius by a sudden movement fell upon the 
outposts of the enemy, and made trial of their courage in a

slight skirmish, the combatants separating on equal terms. Soon 
afterwards, C&aelig;cina strongly fortified a camp between <placeName key="tgn,7005892">Hostilia</placeName>, a village belonging to <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>, and the marshes of the river <placeName key="tgn,1130649">Tartarus</placeName>, where his position was secure, as his rear was 
covered by the river, and his flank by intervening marshes. Had he only been 
loyal, those two legions, which had not been joined by the army of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, might have been crushed by the united 
strength of the Vitellianists, or driven back and compelled to evacuate <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> in a disgraceful retreat. C&aelig;cina, however, 
by various delays betrayed to the enemy the early opportunities of the 
campaign, assailing by letters those whom it was easy to drive out by force 
of arms, until by his envoys he settled the conditions of his treachery. In 
this interval Aponius Saturninus came up with the 7th legion (Claudius's). 
This legion was commanded by the tribune Vipstanus Messalla, a man of 
illustrious family, himself highly distinguished, the only man who had 
brought into that conflict an honest purpose. To this army, which was far 
from equalling the forces of Vitellius (it in fact consisted of three 
legions), C&aelig;cina despatched a letter reproaching them with rashness in 
again drawing the sword in a vanquished cause. At the same time he extolled 
the valour of the German army; of Vitellius he made but some slight and 
common-place mention without any abuse of Vespasian. Certainly he said 
nothing which could either seduce or terrify the enemy. The leaders of the 
Flavianist party, omitting all apology for their former fortune, at once 
took up a tone of high praise of Vespasian, of confidence in their cause, of 
security as to their army, and of hostility to Vitellius, while hopes were 
held out to the tribunes and centurions of retaining the privileges which 
Vitellius had granted them, and C&aelig;cina was himself encouraged in no 
ambiguous terms to change sides. These letters read to the assembled army 
increased their confidence; for C&aelig;cina had written in a humble strain, 
as if he feared to offend Vespasian, while their own generals had used 
contemptuous language, meant, it would seem, to insult Vitellius.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>On the subsequent arrival of two legions, 
the third commanded by Dillius Aponianus, the eighth by Numisius Lupus, it 
was resolved to make a demonstration of their

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">FLAVIANIST SOLDIERS MUTINOUS</note>
strength, and to surround <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName> with military lines. It so happened that Galba's 
legion had had their work allotted to them on that side the lines which 
faced the enemy, and that some of the allied cavalry appearing in the 
distance were taken for the enemy, and excited a groundless panic. They flew 
to arms, and as the rage of the soldiers at the supposed treachery fell upon 
T. Ampius Flavianus, not from any proof of his guilt, but because he had 
been long unpopular, they clamoured for his death in a very whirlwind of 
passion, vociferating that he was the kinsman of Vitellius, that he had 
betrayed Otho, that he had embezzled the donative. He could get no 
opportunity of defending himself, even though he stretched out his hands in 
entreaty, repeatedly prostrating himself on the ground, his garments torn, 
his breast and features convulsed with sobs. This very conduct provoked 
afresh these furious men, for fear so excessive seemed to argue a 
consciousness of guilt. Aponius was clamoured down by the shouts of the 
soldiers, when he attempted to address them; every one else was repulsed 
with noisy cries. To Antonius alone the soldiers' ears were open; for he had 
eloquence, the art of soothing an angry crowd, and personal influence. As 
the mutiny grew fiercer, and the soldiers went on from abuse and taunts to 
use their hands and their weapons, he ordered that Flavianus should be put 
in irons. The soldiers saw what a mockery it was, and pushing aside those 
who were guarding the tribunal, were about to commit the most outrageous 
violence. Antonius threw himself in the way with his sword drawn, protesting 
that he would die either by the soldiers' hands or by his own; whenever he 
saw any one who was known to him, or who was distinguished by any military 
decoration, he summoned him by name to his assistance. Then he turned to the 
standards, and prayed to the gods of war, that they would inspire the armies 
of the enemy, rather than his own, with such madness and such strife. So the 
mutiny began to abate, and at the close of the day the men dispersed to 
their tents. The same night Flavianus set out, and being met by letters from 
Vespasian, was relieved from his perilous position.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>The legions had caught the infection of mutiny, 
and

 next assailed Aponius Saturnius, legate of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, this time the more furiously because their 
rage broke out, not as before, when they were wearied with labour and 
military toils, but at mid-day. Some letters had been published, which 
Saturninus was believed to have written to Vitellius. If once they had 
emulated each other in valour and obedience, so now there was a rivalry in 
insubordination and insolence, till they clamoured as violently for the 
execution of Aponius as they had for that of Flavianus. The legions of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> recalled how they had aided the vengeance of 
 the Pannonian army, while the soldiers of <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, 
as if they were absolved by the mutiny of others, took a delight in 
repeating their fault. They hastened to the gardens in which Saturninus was 
passing his time, and it was not the efforts of Primus Antonius, Aponianus, 
and Messalla, though they exerted themselves to the uttermost, that saved 
him, so much as the obscurity of the hiding-place in which he concealed 
himself, for he was hidden in the furnace of some baths that happened to be 
out of use. In a short time he gave up his lictors, and retired to <placeName key="perseus,Patavium">Patavium</placeName>. After the departure of the two men of consular 
rank, all power and authority over the two armies centred in Antonius alone, 
his colleagues giving way to him, and the soldiers being strongly biassed in 
his favour. There were those who believed that both these mutinies were set 
on foot by the intrigues of Antonius, in order that he might engross all the 
prizes of the war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>Nor indeed was 
there less restlessness among the partisans of Vitellius, who were 
distracted by yet more fatal dissensions, springing, not from the suspicions 
of the common men, but from the treachery of the generals. Lucilius Bassus, 
prefect of the <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName> fleet, finding that the 
 troops wavered in purpose, from the fact that many were natives of <placeName key="tgn,7015451">Dalmatia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, provinces 
held for Vespasian, had attached them to the Flavianist party. The 
night-time was chosen for accomplishing the treason, because then, unknown 
to all the rest, the ringleaders alone might assemble at head-quarters. 
Bassus, moved by shame, or perhaps by fear, awaited the issue in his house. 
The captains of the triremes rushed with a great outcry on the images

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">TREACHERY AMONG VITELLIANISTS</note>
of Vitellius; a 
few, who attempted to resist, were cut down; the great majority, with the 
usual love of change, were ready to join Vespasian. Then Bassus came forward 
and openly sanctioned the movement. The fleet appointed Cornelius Fuscus to 
be prefect, and he hastened to join them. Lucilius was put under honourable 
arrest, and conveyed as far as <placeName key="perseus,Adria">Adria</placeName> by the 
Liburnian ships; there he was thrown into prison by Vivennius Rufinus, 
prefect of a squadron of cavalry, which was there in garrison. His chains, 
however, were immediately struck off on the interference of Hormus, one of 
the Emperor's freedmen, for he too ranked among the generals.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>On the revolt of the fleet becoming known, 
C&aelig;cina called together to head-quarters, which he purposely selected 
as being the most retired part of the camp, the chief centurions and some 
few soldiers, while the rest were dispersed on various military duties. Then 
he extolled the valour of Vespasian, and the strength of his party; he told 
them that the fleet had changed sides, that they were straitened for 
supplies, that <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> were against them, that in the capital there was 
nothing on which to rely, thus making the worst of everything that concerned 
Vitellius. Then, the conspirators present setting the example, and the rest 
being paralysed by the strangeness of the proceeding, he made them swear 
allegiance to Vespasian. At the same time the images of Vitellius were torn 
down, and persons were despatched to convey the intelligence to Antonius. 
But when this treason became noised abroad throughout the camp, when the 
soldiers, hurrying back to head-quarters, saw the name of Vespasian written 
on the colours, and the images of Vitellius thrown upon the ground, first 
there was a gloomy silence, then all their rage burst out at once. "What," 
they cried, "has the glory of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> 
fallen so low, that without a battle, even without a wound, they should 
yield up hands ready bound and arms resigned to surrender? What legions 
indeed are these against us? Only the conquered. The first and the twelfth, 
the sole strength of the Othonianist army, are not there, and even them we 
routed and crushed on these very plains, only that so many thousands of 
armed men, like a herd of slaves for sale,

might be given as a 
present to the exile Antonius. Thus, forsooth, the adhesion of one fleet 
would be worth eight legions. So it pleases Bassus and C&aelig;cina, after 
robbing the Emperor of palaces, gardens, and money, to rob the soldiers of 
their Emperor. But we, who have seen nothing of toil and bloodshed, we, who 
must be contemptible even to the Flavianists, what shall we answer to those 
who shall ask us of our victories and our defeats?"</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>Joining one and all in these cries, by which each 
expressed his own vexation, they proceeded, following the lead of the fifth 
legion, to replace the images of Vitellius, and to put C&aelig;cina in 
irons. They elected to the command Fabius Fabullus, legate of the fifth 
legion, and Cassius Longus, prefect of the camp; they massacred the soldiers 
from three Liburnian ships, who happened to fall in their way, but who were 
perfectly ignorant and innocent of these proceedings; they then abandoned 
the camp, and, after breaking down the bridge, fell back on <placeName key="tgn,7005892">Hostilia</placeName>, and thence on <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, 
in order to effect a junction with the two legions, the 1st Italica and the 
21st Rapax, which, with a portion of the cavalry, C&aelig;cina had sent on 
to occupy <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>On this becoming known to Antonius, he determined to attack the 
hostile armies, while they were still distracted in feeling and divided in 
strength, before the generals could recover their authority, and the 
soldiers their subordination along with that confidence which would spring 
from the junction of the legions. He concluded indeed that Fabius Valens had 
left the capital, and would hasten his march, on hearing of the treason of 
C&aelig;cina; and Fabius was loyal to Vitellius, and not without some 
military skill. At the same time he dreaded the approach of a vast body of 
Germans by way of <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName>. Vitellius had also 
 summoned reinforcements from <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, whose arms 
would have wasted like a wide-spread pestilence, had not Antonius, fearful 
of this very danger, hurried on an engagement, and thus secured his victory. 
He reached <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName> with his whole army in two 
days' march from <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>. The next day, keeping the 
legions to fortify the position, he sent the auxiliary infantry into the 
territories of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, ostensibly

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">ANTONIUS CHARGES VITELLIANISTS</note>
to collect supplies, really 
to imbue the soldiery with a taste for the spoils of civil war. He himself 
advanced with 4000 cavalry as far as the 8th milestone from <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, in order that they might plunder with greater 
freedom. The scouts, as usual, took a wider range.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>It was almost eleven o'clock, when a horseman 
arrived at full speed with the news, that the enemy were approaching, that a 
small body was moving in front, but that the stir and noise could be heard 
far and wide. While Antonius was deliberating as to what was to be done, 
Arrius Varus, eager to do his best, charged with the bravest of the cavalry, 
and drove back the Vitellianists, inflicting upon them some slight loss; as 
more came up, the fortune of the day changed, and those who had been most 
eager in the pursuit found themselves last in the flight. This rash act did 
not originate with Antonius; he anticipated in fact what actually happened. 
He now urged his soldiers to enter on the battle with a good heart; he then 
drew off the squadrons of his cavalry to the two flanks, leaving in the 
midst an open space in which to receive Varus and his troopers; the legions 
were ordered to arm themselves, signals were made over the country that 
every man should leave plundering, and join the battle at the nearest point. 
Meanwhile the terror-stricken Varus plunged into the disordered ranks of his 
friends, and brought a panic with him. The fresh troops were driven back 
along with the wounded fugitives, confused by their own alarm and by the 
difficulties of the road.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>In the 
midst of this panic Antonius omitted nothing that a self-possessed commander 
or a most intrepid soldier could do. He threw himself before the terrified 
fugitives, he held back those who were giving way, and wherever the struggle 
was hardest, wherever there was a gleam of hope, there he was with his ready 
skill, his bold hand, his encouraging voice, easily recognized by the enemy, 
and a conspicuous object to his own men. At last he was carried to such a 
pitch of excitement, that he transfixed with a lance a flying standard 
bearer, and then, seizing the standard, turned it towards the enemy. Touched 
by the reproach, a few troopers, not more than a hundred in number, made a 
stand. The locality favoured them, for the road was at that point

particularly narrow, while the bridge over the stream which crossed 
it had been broken down, and the stream itself, with its varying channel and 
its precipitous banks, checked their flight. It was this necessity, or a 
happy chance, that restored the fallen fortunes of the party. Forming 
themselves into strong and close ranks, they received the attack of the 
Vitellianists, who were now imprudently scattered. These were at once 
overthrown. Antonius pursued those that fled, and crushed those that 
encountered him. Then came the rest of his troops, who, as they were 
severally disposed, plundered, made prisoners, or seized on weapons and 
horses. Roused by the shouts of triumph, those who had lately been scattered 
in flight over the fields hastened to share in the victory.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>At the fourth milestone from <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> glittered the standards of two legions, the 
Italica and the Rapax, which had been advanced as far as that point during 
the success achieved by the first movement of their cavalry. But when 
fortune changed, they would not open their ranks, nor receive the fugitives, 
nor advance and themselves attack an enemy now exhausted by so protracted a 
pursuit and conflict. Vanquished by accident, these men had never in their 
success valued their general as much as they now in disaster felt his 
absence. The victorious cavalry charged the wavering line; the tribune 
Vipstanus Messalla followed with the auxiliary troops from <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, whom, though hurriedly brought up, long 
service had made as good soldiers as the legionaries. The horse and foot, 
thus mixed together, broke through the line of the legions. The near 
neighbourhood of the fortifications of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, 
while it gave more hope of escape, diminished the vigour of their 
resistance.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>Antonius did not press 
forward, for he thought of the fatigue and the wounds with which a battle so 
hard fought, notwithstanding its successful termination, must have disabled 
his cavalry and their horses. As the shadows of evening deepened the whole 
strength of the Flavianist army came up. They advanced amid heaps of dead 
and the traces of recent slaughter, and, as if the war was over, demanded 
that they should advance to <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and receive the 
capitulation of the vanquished party, or take the place by

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIANISTS DEFEATED</note>
storm. This was the motive alleged, 
and it sounded well, but what every one said to himself was this: "The 
colony, situated as it is on level ground, may be taken by assault. If we 
attack under cover of darkness, we shall be at least as bold, and shall 
enjoy more licence in plunder. If we wait for the light, we shall be met 
with entreaties for peace, and in return for our toil and our wounds shall 
receive only the empty satisfaction of clemency and praise, but the wealth 
of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> will go into the purses of the legates 
and the prefects. The soldiers have the plunder of a city that is stormed, 
the generals of one which capitulates." The centurions and tribunes were 
spurned away; that no man's voice might be heard, the troops clashed their 
weapons together, ready to break through all discipline, unless they were 
led as they wished.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>Antonius then 
made his way into the companies. When his presence and personal authority 
had restored silence, he declared, "I would not snatch their glory or their 
reward from those who have deserved them so well. Yet there is a division of 
duties between the army and its generals. Eagerness for battle becomes the 
soldiers, but generals serve the cause by forethought, by counsel, by delay 
oftener than by temerity. As I promoted your victory to the utmost of my 
power by my sword and by my personal exertions, so now I must help you by 
prudence and by counsel, the qualities which belong peculiarly to a general. 
What you will have to encounter is indeed perfectly plain. There will be the 
darkness, the strange localities of the town, the enemy inside the walls, 
and all possible facilities for ambuscades. Even if the gates were wide 
open, we ought not to enter the place, except we had first reconnoitred it, 
and in the day-time. Shall we set about storming the town when we have no 
means of seeing where the ground is level, what is the height of the walls, 
whether the city is to be assailed by our artillery and javelins, or by 
siege-works and covered approaches?" He then turned to individual soldiers, 
asking them whether they had brought with them their axes and spades and 
whatever else is used when towns are to be stormed. On their admitting that 
they had not done so, "Can any hands," he answered, "break through and

undermine walls with swords and lances? And if it should be found 
necessary to throw up an embankment and to shelter ourselves under mantlets 
and hurdles, shall we stand baffled like a thoughtless mob, marvelling at 
the height of the towers and at the enemy's defences? Shall we not rather, 
by delaying one night, till our artillery and engines come up, take with us 
a strength that must prevail?" At the same time he sent the sutlers and 
camp-followers with the freshest of the cavalry to <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName> to fetch supplies and whatever else they 
needed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>The soldiers, however, were 
impatient, and a mutiny had almost broken out, when some cavalry, who had 
advanced to the very walls of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, seized some 
stragglers from the town, from whose information it was ascertained, that 
the six legions of Vitellius and the entire army which had been quartered at 
 <placeName key="tgn,7005892">Hostilia</placeName> had on that very day marched a distance of 
thirty miles, and having heard of the defeat of their comrades, were 
preparing for battle, and would soon be coming up. This alarm opened the 
ears that had before been deaf to their general's advice. The 13th legion 
was ordered to take up its position on the raised causeway of the <placeName key="tgn,6006330">Via Postumia</placeName>, supported on the left by the 7th (Galba's) 
which was posted in the plain, next came the 7th (Claudius'), defended in 
front by a field-ditch, such being the character of the ground. On the right 
was the 8th legion, drawn up in an open space, and then the 3rd, whose ranks 
were divided by some thick brushwood. Such was the arrangement of the eagles 
and the standards. The soldiers were mingled in the darkness as accident had 
determined. The Pr&aelig;torian colours were close to the 3rd legion; the 
auxiliary infantry were stationed on the wings; the cavalry covered the 
flanks and the rear. Sido and Italicus, the Suevian chieftains, with a 
picked body of their countrymen, man&oelig;uvred in the van.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>It would have been the best policy for the army of 
Vitellius to rest at <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and, with strength 
recruited by food and repose, to attack and crush the next day an enemy 
exhausted by cold and hunger; but now, wanting a leader, and having no 
settled plan, they came into collision about nine o'clock at night with the 
Flavianist troops, who

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">FLAVIANISTS EAGER TO 
PURSUE</note>
stood ready, and in order of battle. Respecting the 
disposition of the Vitellianist army, disordered as it was by its fury and 
by the darkness, I would not venture to speak positively. Some, however, 
have related, that on the right wing was the 4th legion (the Macedonian); 
that the 5th and 15th, with the veterans of three British legions (the 9th, 
2nd, and 20th), formed the centre, while the left wing was made up of the 
1st, the 16th, and the 22nd. Men of the legions Rapax and Italica were 
mingled with all the companies. The cavalry and the auxiliaries chose their 
position themselves. Throughout the night the battle raged in many forms, 
indecisive and fierce, destructive, first to one side, then to the other. 
Courage, strength, even the eye with its keenest sight, were of no avail. 
Both armies fought with the same weapons; the watch-word, continually asked, 
became known; the colours were confused together, as parties of combatants 
snatched them from the enemy, and hurried them in this or that direction. 
The 7th legion, recently levied by Galba, was the hardest pressed. Six 
centurions of the first rank were killed, and some of the standards taken; 
but the eagle was saved by Atilius Verus, the centurion of the first 
company, who, after making a great slaughter among the enemy, at last 
fell.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>The line was supported, as it 
began to waver, by Antonius, who brought up the Pr&aelig;torians. They took 
up the conflict, repulsed the enemy, and were then themselves repulsed. The 
troops of Vitellius had collected their artillery on the raised causeway, 
where there was a free and open space for the discharge of the missiles, 
which at first had been scattered at random, and had struck against the 
trees without injury to the enemy. An engine of remarkable size, belonging 
to the 15th legion, was crushing the hostile ranks with huge stones, and 
would have spread destruction far and wide, had not two soldiers ventured on 
a deed of surpassing bravery. Disguising themselves with shields snatched 
from the midst of the carnage, they cut the ropes and springs of the engine. 
They were instantly slain, and their names have consequently been lost; but 
the fact is undoubted. Fortune favoured neither side, till at a late hour of 
the night the moon rose and showed, but showed de-

ceptively, 
both armies. The light, however, shining from behind, favoured the 
Flavianists. With them a lengthened shadow fell from men and horses, and the 
enemy's missiles, incorrectly aimed at what seemed the substance, fell 
short, while the Vitellianists, who had the light shining on their faces, 
were unconsciously exposed to an enemy who were, so to speak, concealed 
while they aimed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>As soon as Antonius 
could recognize his men and be recognized by them, he sought to kindle their 
courage, striving to shame some with his reproaches, stirring many with 
praise and encouragement, and all with hopes and promises, "Why," he 
demanded of the legions of <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, "have you again 
taken up arms? yonder is the field where you may wipe out the stain of past 
disgrace, and redeem your honour." Then turning to the troops of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, he appealed to them as the authors and 
originators of the war. "Idly," he said "have you challenged the 
Vitellianists with threatening words, if you cannot abide their attack or 
even their looks." So he spoke to each as he approached them. The third 
legion he addressed at greater length, reminding them of old and recent 
achievements, how under Marcus Antonius they had defeated the Parthians, 
under Corbulo the Armenians, and had lately discomfited the Sarmatians. Then 
angrily turning to the Pr&aelig;torians, "Clowns," said he "unless you are 
victorious, what other general, what other camp will receive you? There are 
your colours and your arms; defeat is death, for disgrace you have 
exhausted." A shout was raised on all sides, and the soldiers of the third 
legion saluted, as is the custom in <placeName key="1000140">Syria</placeName>, the 
rising sun.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>A vague rumour thus 
arose, or was intentionally suggested by the general, that Mucianus had 
arrived, and that the two armies had exchanged salutations. The men then 
charged as confidently as if they had been strengthened by fresh 
reinforcements, while the enemy's array was now less compact; for, as there 
was no one to command, it was now contracted, now extended, as the courage 
or fear of individual soldiers might prompt. Antonius, seeing that they gave 
way, charged them with a heavy column; the loose ranks were at once broken, 
and, entangled as they were among their waggons and artillery, could not be 
re-formed.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIANISTS AGAIN 
DEFEATED</note>
The conquerors, in the eagerness of pursuit, dispersed 
themselves over the entire line of road. The slaughter that followed was 
made particularly memorable through the murder of a father by his son. I 
will record the incident with the names, on the authority of Vipstanus 
Messalla. Julius Mansuetus, a Spaniard, enlisting in the legion Rapax, had 
left at home a son of tender age. The lad grew up to manhood, and was 
enrolled by Galba in the 7th legion. Now chancing to meet his father, he 
brought him to the ground with a wound, and, as he rifled his dying foe, 
recognized him, and was himself recognized. Clasping the expiring man in his 
arms, in piteous accents he implored the spirit of his father to be 
propitious to him, and not to turn from him with loathing as from a 
parricide. "This guilt," he said, "is shared by all; how small a part of a 
civil war is a single soldier!" With these words he raised the body, opened 
a grave, and discharged the last duties for his father. This was noticed by 
those who were on the spot, then by many others; astonishment and 
indignation ran through the whole army, and they cursed this most horrible 
war. Yet as eagerly as ever they stripped the bodies of slaughtered 
kinsfolk, connexions, and brothers. They talk of an impious act having been 
done, and they do it themselves.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>When 
they reached <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> a fresh work of vast difficulty 
presented itself. During the war with Otho the legions of <placeName key="7000084">Germany</placeName> had formed their camp round the walls of the 
city, round this camp had drawn an entrenchment, and had again strengthened 
these defences. At this sight the victorious army hesitated, while the 
generals doubted what orders they should give. To attempt an assault with 
troops exhausted by the toil of a day and a night would be difficult, and 
with no proper reserves might be perilous. Should they return to <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>, the fatigue of so long a march would be 
insupportable, and their victory would result in nothing. To entrench a camp 
with the enemy so close at hand would be dangerous, as by a sudden sortie 
they might cause confusion among them while dispersed and busied with the 
work. Above all, they were afraid of their own soldiers, who were more 
patient of danger than delay. Cautious measures they disliked; their 
rashness inspired them

with hope, and eagerness for plunder 
outweighed all the horrors of carnage, wounds, and bloodshed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>Antonius himself was this way inclined, and he 
ordered the entrenched camp to be invested. At first they fought from a 
distance with arrows and stones, the Flavianists suffering most, as the 
enemy's missiles were aimed at them from a superior height. Antonius then 
assigned to each legion the attack on some portion of the entrenchments, and 
on one particular gate, seeking by this division of labour to distinguish 
the cowardly from the brave, and to stimulate his men by an honourable 
rivalry. The 3rd and 7th legions took up a position close to the road from 
<placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>; more to the right of the entrenchments 
were stationed the 8th and the 7th (Claudius'). The 13th were carried by the 
impetuosity of their attack as far as the gate looking towards <placeName key="perseus,Brixia">Brixia</placeName>. There ensued a little delay, while from the 
neighbouring fields some were collecting spades and pick-axes, others hooks 
and ladders. Then raising their shields over their heads, they advanced to 
the rampart in a dense "testudo." Both used the arts of Roman warfare; the 
Vitellianists rolled down ponderous stones, and drove spears and long poles 
into the broken and tottering "testudo," till the dense array of shields was 
loosened, and the ground was strewn with a vast number of lifeless and 
mangled bodies.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>Some hesitation had 
shewn itself, when the generals, seeing that the weary troops would not 
listen to what seemed to them unmeaning encouragement, pointed to <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. Whether this was, as Messalla relates, the 
device of Hormus, or whether Caius Plinius be the better authority when he 
charges it upon Antonius, I cannot easily determine. All I can say is this, 
that neither in Antonius nor in Hormus would this foulest of crimes have 
been a degeneracy from the character of their former lives. Wounds or 
bloodshed no longer kept the men back from undermining the rampart and 
battering the gates. Supported on the shoulders of comrades, and forming a 
second "testudo," they clambered up and seized the weapons and even the 
hands of the enemy. The unhurt and the wounded, the half-dead and the dying, 
were mingled together with every incident of slaughter and death in every 
form.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="29">
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DIFFICULTY OF TAKING <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">CREMONA</placeName></note><p>The 
fiercest struggle was maintained by the 3rd and 7th legions, and Antonius in 
person with some chosen auxiliaries concentrated his efforts on the same 
point. The Vitellianists, unable to resist the combined and resolute attack, 
and finding that their missiles glided off the "testudo," at last threw the 
engine itself on the assailants; for a moment it broke and overwhelmed those 
on whom it fell, but it drew after it in its fall the battlements and upper 
part of the rampart. At the same time an adjoining tower yielded to the 
volleys of stones, and, while the 7th legion in wedge-like array was 
endeavouring to force an entrance, the 3rd broke down the gate with axes and 
swords. All authors are agreed that Caius Volusius, a soldier of the 3rd 
legion, entered first. Beating down all who opposed him, he mounted the 
rampart, waved his hand, and shouted aloud that the camp was taken. The rest 
of the legion burst in, while the troops of Vitellius were seized with 
panic, and threw themselves from the rampart. The entire space between the 
camp and the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> was filled with 
slain.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>Difficulties of another kind 
presented themselves in the lofty walls of the town, its stone towers, its 
iron-barred gates, in the garrison who stood brandishing their weapons, in 
its numerous population devoted to the interests of Vitellius, and in the 
vast conflux from all parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> which had 
assembled at the fair regularly held at that time. The besieged found a 
source of strength in these large numbers; the assailants an incentive in 
the prospect of booty. Antonius gave orders that fire should instantly be 
set to the finest buildings without the city, to see whether the inhabitants 
of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> might not be induced by the loss of their 
property to transfer their allegiance. Some houses near the walls, which 
overtopped the fortifications, he filled with the bravest of his soldiers, 
who, by hurling beams, tiles, and flaming missiles, dislodged the defenders 
from the ramparts.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>The legions now 
began to form themselves into a "testudo," and the other troops to discharge 
volleys of stones and darts, when the courage of the Vitellianists began to 
flag. The higher their rank, the more readily they succumbed to fortune, 
fearing that when <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> had fallen quarter could 
no longer be expected, and that all the

fury of the conqueror 
would be turned, not on the penniless crowd, but on the tribunes and 
centurions, by whose slaughter something was to be gained. The common 
soldiers, careless of the future and safer in their obscurity, still held 
out. Roaming through the streets or concealed in the houses, they would not 
sue for peace even when they had abandoned the contest. The principal 
officers of the camp removed the name and images of Vitellius; C&aelig;cina, 
who was still in confinement, they released from his chains, imploring him 
to plead their cause. When he haughtily rejected their suit, they entreated 
him with tears; and it was indeed the last aggravation of misery, that many 
valiant men should invoke the aid of a traitor. Then they displayed from the 
walls the olive-branches and chaplets of suppliants, and when Antonius had 
ordered that the discharge of missiles should cease, they brought out the 
eagles and standards. Then followed, with eyes bent on the ground, a dismal 
array of unarmed men. The conquerors had gathered round; at first they 
heaped reproaches on them and pointed at them their weapons; then seeing how 
they offered their cheeks to insulting blows, how, with all their high 
spirit departed, they submitted, as vanquished men, to every indignity, it 
suddenly occurred to their recollection, that these were the very soldiers 
who but shortly before had used with moderation their victory at <placeName>Bedriacum</placeName>. Yet, when C&aelig;cina the consul, 
conspicuous in his robes of state and with his train of lictors, came 
forward thrusting aside the crowd, the victors were fired with indignation, 
and reproached him with his tyranny, his cruelty, and, so hateful are such 
crimes, even with his treason. Antonius checked them, gave him an escort, 
and sent him to Vespasian.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>Meanwhile 
the population of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> was roughly handled by the 
soldiers, who were just beginning a massacre, when their fury was mitigated 
by the entreaties of the generals. Antonius summoned them to an assembly, 
extolled the conquerors, spoke kindly to the conquered, but said nothing 
either way of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. Over and above the innate 
love of plunder, there was an old feud which made the army bent on the 
destruction of the inhabitants. It was generally believed that in the war 
with Otho, as well as in the pres-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CAPTURE AND 
SACK OF <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">CREMONA</placeName></note>
ent, they had supported the 
cause of Vitellius. Afterwards, when the 13th legion had been left to build 
an amphitheatre, with the characteristic insolence of a city population, 
they had wantonly provoked and insulted them. The ill-feeling had been 
aggravated by the gladiatorial show exhibited there by C&aelig;cina, by the 
circumstance that their city was now for the second time the seat of war, 
and by the fact that they had supplied the Vitellianists with provisions in 
the field, and that some of their women, taken by party-zeal into the 
battle, had there been slain. The occurrence of the fair filled the colony, 
rich as it always was, with an appearance of still greater wealth. The other 
generals were unnoticed; Antonius from his success and high reputation was 
observed of all. He had hastened to the baths to wash off the blood; and 
when he found fault with the temperature of the water, an answer was heard, 
"that it would soon be warm enough." Thus the words of a slave brought on 
him the whole odium of having given the signal for firing the town, which 
was indeed already in flames.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>Forty 
thousand armed men burst into <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and with them 
a body of sutlers and camp-followers, yet more numerous and yet more 
abandoned to lust and cruelty. Neither age nor rank were any protection from 
indiscriminate slaughter and violation. Aged men and women past their prime, 
worthless as booty, were dragged about in wanton insult. Did a grown up 
maiden or youth of marked beauty fall in their way, they were torn in pieces 
by the violent hands of ravishers; and in the end the destroyers themselves 
were provoked into mutual slaughter. Men, as they carried off for themselves 
coin or temple-offerings of massive gold, were cut down by others of 
superior strength. Some, scorning what met the eye, searched for hidden 
wealth, and dug up buried treasures, applying the scourge and the torture to 
the owners. In their hands were flaming torches, which, as soon as they had 
carried out the spoil, they wantonly hurled into the gutted houses and 
plundered temples. In an army which included such varieties of language and 
character, an army comprising Roman citizens, allies, and foreigners, there 
was every kind of lust, each man had a law of his own, and nothing was 
forbidden. For four

days <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> 
satisfied the plunderers. When all things else, sacred and profane, were 
settling down into the flames, the temple of Mephitis outside the walls 
alone remained standing, saved by its situation or by divine 
interposition.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>Such was the end of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, 286 years after its foundation. It was built in 
the consulship of Tiberius Sempronius and Cornelius Scipio, when <persName>Hannibal</persName> 
was threatening <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, as a protection against the 
 Gauls from beyond the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, or against any other 
sudden invader from the <placeName>Alps</placeName>. From the number of 
settlers, the conveniences afforded by the rivers, the fertility of the 
soil, and the many connexions and intermarriages formed with neighbouring 
nations, it grew and flourished, unharmed by foreign enemies, though most 
unfortunate in civil wars. Ashamed of the atrocious deed, and aware of the 
detestation which it was inspiring, Antonius issued a proclamation, that no 
one should detain in captivity a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. 
The spoil indeed had been rendered valueless to the soldiers by a general 
agreement throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, which rejected with 
loathing the purchase of such slaves. A massacre then began; when this was 
known, the prisoners were secretly ransomed by their friends and relatives. 
The remaining inhabitants soon returned to <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>; 
the temples and squares were restored by the munificence of the burghers, 
and Vespasian gave his exhortations.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>The soil poisoned with blood forbade the enemy to remain long by the ruins 
of the buried city. They advanced to the third milestone, and gathered the 
dispersed and panic-stricken Vitellianists round their proper standards. The 
vanquished legions were then scattered throughout <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>; for civil war was not over, and they might 
play a doubtful part. Messengers carrying news of the victory were then 
despatched to <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> and to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>. Julius Calenus, a tribune, was sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and Alpinius Montanus, prefect of a cohort, to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; as the one was an &AElig;duan, the other a 
Trever, and both were Vitellianists, they would be a proof of the success. 
At the same time the passes of the <placeName>Alps</placeName> were 
occupied with troops, for it was suspected that <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> was arming itself to support Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>A few days after the departure of 
C&aelig;cina, Vitellius

<note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="perseus,Cremona">CREMONA</placeName> RESTORED; VITELLIUS SLOTHFUL</note>
had hurried 
Fabius Valens to the seat of war, and was now seeking to hide his 
apprehensions from himself by indulgence. He made no military preparation; 
he did not seek to invigorate the soldiers by encouraging speeches or 
warlike exercises; he did not keep himself before the eyes of the people. 
Buried in the shades of his gardens, like those sluggish animals which, if 
you supply them with food, lie motionless and torpid, he had dismissed with 
the same forgetfulness the past, the present, and the future. While he thus 
lay wasting his powers in sloth among the woods of <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>, he was startled by the treachery of Lucilius 
Bassus and the defection of the fleet at <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName>. 
Then came the news about C&aelig;cina, and he heard with a satisfaction 
mingled with distress, first, that he had revolted, and then, that he had 
been put in irons by the army. In that dull soul joy was more powerful than 
apprehension. In great exultation he returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and before a crowded assembly of the people heaped 
praises on the dutiful obedience of the soldiers. He ordered Publius 
Sabinus, prefect of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard, to be thrown into prison, 
because of his friendship with C&aelig;cina, and substituted in his place 
Alfenius Varus.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>He then addressed the 
Senate in a speech of studied grandiloquence, and was extolled by the 
Senators with elaborate adulation. A savage resolution against C&aelig;cina 
was moved by Lucius Vitellius; the rest affected indignation at the idea 
that a consul had betrayed the State, a general his Emperor, a man loaded 
with wealth so vast and honours so numerous his benefactor, and seemed to 
deplore the wrongs of Vitellius, while they uttered their private griefs. 
Not a word from any one of them disparaged the Flavianist leaders; they 
censured the delusion and recklessness of the armies, and with a prudent 
circumlocution avoided the name of Vespasian. A man was found, who, while 
all regarded with great contempt both giver and receiver, wormed himself by 
flattery into the one day of office which remained to complete the consulate 
of C&aelig;cina. On the last day of October Rosius Regulus both assumed and 
resigned the office. The learned remarked that never before had a new consul 
been elected without a formal act of deprivation and the passing of a law. 
Before this indeed Caninius Rebilus

had been consul for a single 
day during the dictatorship of Caius C&aelig;sar, when the prizes of the 
civil war had to be enjoyed in haste.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>At this time the murder of Junius Bl&aelig;sus obtained an infamous 
notoriety. Of this act I have heard the following account. Vitellius, who 
was suffering from severe illness, observed from the Servilian gardens a 
neighbouring turret brilliantly illuminated throughout the night. Inquiring 
the cause, he was told that C&aelig;cina Tuscus was entertaining a large 
party, of whom Junius Bl&aelig;sus was the most distinguished. Other 
particulars were given with much exaggeration about the splendour of the 
banquet and the unrestrained gaiety of the guests. There were persons who 
charged Tuscus and his guests, and Bl&aelig;sus more vindictively than any, 
with passing their days in merriment while the Emperor was sick. As soon as 
it was sufficiently clear to those who keenly watch the angry moods of 
princes, that Vitellius was exasperated, and that Bl&aelig;sus might be 
destroyed, the part of the informer was intrusted to Lucius Vitellius. An 
unworthy jealousy made him the enemy of Bl&aelig;sus, whose illustrious 
character raised him far above one who was stained with every infamy; he 
burst into the Imperial chamber, and clasping to his bosom the Emperor's 
son, fell at his knees. On Vitellius enquiring the cause of his emotion: "It 
is not," he replied, "from any private apprehension, or because I am anxious 
for myself; it is for a brother and for a brother's children that I have 
come hither with my prayers and tears. It is idle to fear Vespasian, when 
there are so many legions of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, so many 
provinces with their valour and their loyalty, and lastly, so vast an extent 
of sea and land with enormous distances, to keep him from us. In the 
capital, in the very bosom of the empire, there is the foe of whom we must 
beware, a foe who boasts of Junii and Antonii among his ancestors, and who, 
claiming an Imperial descent, displays to the soldiers his condescension and 
his magnificence. On him all thoughts are fixed, while Vitellius, regardless 
alike of friends and foes, is cherishing a rival, who from his banqueting 
table gazes at the sufferings of his sovereign. For such ill-timed mirth let 
him be recompensed with a night of

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">EXECUTIONS 
SHOW VITELLIUS' FEAR</note>
sorrow and of death, that he may know and feel 
that Vitellius still lives and reigns, and has a son, if in the course of 
destiny anything should happen to himself."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>Vitellius, after wavering between his guilty purpose and his 
fears, dreading lest to postpone the murder of Bl&aelig;sus might hasten his 
own ruin, while openly to order it might provoke terrible odium, determined 
to destroy him by poison. He gave a proof of his guilt by his marked joy 
when he visited Bl&aelig;sus. He was even heard to utter a most brutal 
speech, in which (I will relate the very words) he boasted that he had 
feasted his eyes on the spectacle of his enemy's death. Besides his noble 
birth and refinement of character, Bl&aelig;sus was a man of resolute 
loyalty. In the flourishing days of the party, when canvassed by 
C&aelig;cina and the leading men, who were beginning to despise Vitellius, 
he persevered in rejecting their solicitations. A righteous man and a lover 
of peace, who coveted no sudden elevation, much less the throne, he could 
not escape being thought to deserve it.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>Meanwhile Fabius Valens, who was moving along with a vast and 
luxurious train of concubines and eunuchs too tardily for a general about to 
take the field, received speedy intelligence of the betrayal of the <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName> fleet by Lucilius Bassus. Had he hastened the 
march which he had then begun, he might have come up with C&aelig;cina while 
still undecided, or have reached the legions previous to the decisive 
action. Some advised him to take a few of his most devoted soldiers, and, 
avoiding <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName>, to hurry on by unfrequented paths 
 to <placeName key="tgn,7005892">Hostilia</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. 
Others thought that he should summon the Pr&aelig;torian cohorts from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and then force his way with a strong body of 
troops. But with a ruinous delay he wasted in deliberation the opportunities 
of action. Eventually he rejected both plans, and did what is the very worst 
thing in circumstances of peril, attempted a middle course, and was neither 
bold enough on the one hand, nor cautious enough on the other.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>He wrote to Vitellius asking for aid. Three cohorts 
with some British cavalry arrived, a force too numerous to elude 
observation, too small to force its way. Even amidst such perils Valens 
could not keep himself clear of the in-

famous reputation of 
grasping at unlawful gratifications, and of polluting the houses of his 
hosts with intrigue and violation. He had power, he had money, and he 
indulged the lusts that are the last solace of desperate fortunes. At length 
on the arrival of the infantry and cavalry the folly of his plans became 
evident. With so small a force, even had it been thoroughly loyal, he could 
not have made his way through the enemy, and the loyalty they had brought 
with them was not beyond suspicion. Yet shame and respect for the presence 
of their general held them in check, no lasting restraint with men who loved 
danger and were careless of disgrace. Moved by this apprehension, Valens, 
while he retained a few attendants whom adversity had not changed, sent on 
the infantry to <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName> and ordered the cavalry to 
 cover his rear. He then himself made his way to <placeName key="tgn,7003125">Umbria</placeName>, and thence to <placeName>Etruria</placeName>, 
where, having learnt the issue of the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, he conceived a plan not wanting in vigour, and 
which, had it succeeded, would have had terrible results. This was to seize 
some ships, to land on some part of <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia 
Narbonensis</placeName>, to rouse <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> with its armies as 
well as the tribes of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and so to kindle a 
fresh war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>The garrison of <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName> were discouraged by the departure of Valens, 
and Cornelius Fuscus, bringing up his army and disposing his Liburnian ships 
at the nearest points of the shore, invested the place by sea and land. His 
troops occupied the plains of <placeName key="tgn,7003125">Umbria</placeName> and that 
 portion of the Picentine territory that is washed by the <placeName key="tgn,7016532">Adriatic</placeName>, and now the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was divided by the range of the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName> between Vespasian and Vitellius. Valens, 
having started from the bay of <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName>, was compelled, 
either by a calm or a contrary wind, to put in at the port of Hercules 
Mon&oelig;cus. Near this place was stationed Marius Maturus, procurator of 
the <placeName key="tgn,1109327">Maritime Alps</placeName>, who was loyal to Vitellius, and 
who, though every thing around him was hostile, had not yet thrown off his 
allegiance. While courteously receiving Valens, he deterred him by his 
advice from rashly invading <placeName key="tgn,7012209">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName>. And 
now the fidelity of the rest of the party was weakened by their fears. In 
fact the procurator Valerius Paullinus, an enterprising officer, who had

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIANIST ATTEMPT IN <placeName key="tgn,1000070">GAUL</placeName></note>
been a friend of Vespasian before his 
elevation to the throne, had made the neighbouring States swear allegiance 
to that Prince.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>Paullinus had 
collected all the troops who, having been disbanded by Vitellius, were now 
spontaneously taking up arms, and was holding with this force the colony of 
<placeName key="perseus,Forum Julii">Forum Julii</placeName>, which commanded the sea. His influence 
was all the greater, because <placeName key="perseus,Forum Julii">Forum Julii</placeName> was his 
native place, and because he was respected by the Pr&aelig;torians, in which 
force he had once been a tribune. The inhabitants themselves, favouring a 
fellow-townsman, and anticipating his future greatness, did their best to 
promote the cause. When these preparations, which were really formidable and 
were exaggerated by report, became known among the now distracted 
Vitellianists, Fabius Valens returned to his ships with four soldiers of the 
body-guard, three personal friends, and as many centurions, while Maturus 
and the rest chose to remain behind and swear allegiance to Vespasian. For 
Valens indeed the open sea was safer than the coast or the towns, yet, all 
uncertain about the future, and knowing rather what he must avoid than what 
he could trust, he was thrown by adverse weather on the <placeName>St&oelig;chades</placeName>, islands off <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Massilia</placeName>. There he was captured by some Liburnian ships, 
dispatched by Paullinus.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>Valens once 
captured, every thing turned to swell the resources of the conqueror; the 
lead was taken in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> by the 1st legion (the 
"Adjutrix"), whose recollections of <persName>Otho</persName> made them hate Vitellius; they drew 
with them the 6th and 10th. <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> did not hesitate to 
 follow. A partiality long felt in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> for 
Vespasian, who had there commanded the 2nd legion by the appointment of 
Claudius, and had served with distinction, attached that province to his 
cause, though not without some commotion among the other legions, in which 
were many centurions and soldiers promoted by Vitellius, who felt uneasy in 
exchanging for another ruler one whom they knew already.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>These dissensions, and the continual rumours of 
civil war, raised the courage of the Britons. They were led by one Venutius, 
who, besides being naturally high spirited, and hating the name of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, was fired by his private ani-

mosity 
against Queen Cartismandua. Cartismandua ruled the Brigantes in virtue of 
her illustrious birth; and she strengthened her throne, when, by the 
treacherous capture of king Caractacus, she was regarded as having given its 
chief distinction to the triumph of Claudius C&aelig;sar. Then followed 
wealth and the self-indulgence of prosperity. Spurning her husband Venutius, 
she made Vellocatus, his armour-bearer, the partner of her bed and throne. 
By this enormity the power of her house was at once shaken to its base. On 
the side of the husband were the affections of the people, on that of the 
adulterer, the lust and savage temper of the Queen. Accordingly Venutius 
collected some auxiliaries, and, aided at the same time by a revolt of the 
Brigantes, brought Cartismandua into the utmost peril. She asked for some 
Roman troops, and our auxiliary infantry and cavalry, after fighting with 
various success, contrived to rescue the Queen from her peril. Venutius 
retained the kingdom, and we had the war on our hands.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>About the same time, <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> suffered from the supineness of our generals and 
the mutinous conduct of our legions; the assaults of enemies and the perfidy 
of allies all but overthrew the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Of 
this war, its origin and its issue, for it lasted long, I shall hereafter 
speak. The Dacians also were in motion, a people which never can be trusted, 
and which, now that our legions were withdrawn from <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, had nothing to fear. They quietly watched 
the opening of the campaign, but when they heard that <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was in a blaze of war, and that the whole Empire 
was divided against itself, they stormed the winter quarters of the 
auxiliary infantry and cavalry, and occupied both banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName>. They were then preparing to destroy the camp of 
the legions, but Mucianus sent the 6th legion against them, for he knew of 
the victory of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and he feared this double 
pressure of barbarian power with Dacians and Germans invading <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> from opposite sides. We were helped, as often 
before, by the good fortune of the Roman people, which brought to the spot 
Mucianus with the armies of the East, and by the decisive settlement which

of Vitellius. That this army should be dispersed through the provinces and 
closely occupied with foreign wars, was sound policy and essential to 
peace.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>All other nations were equally 
 restless. A sudden outbreak had been excited in <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> by a barbarian slave, who had before commanded 
the royal fleet. This was Anicetus, a freedman of Polemon, once a very 
powerful personage, who, when the kingdom was converted into a Roman 
province, ill brooked the change. Accordingly he raised in the name of 
Vitellius the tribes that border on <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, bribed a 
number of very needy adventurers by the hope of plunder, and, at the head of 
a force by no means contemptible, made a sudden attack on the old and famous 
city of <placeName key="perseus,Trapezus">Trapezus</placeName>, founded by the Greeks on the 
 furthest shore of the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>. There he destroyed a 
cohort, once a part of the royal contingent. They had afterwards received 
the privileges of citizenship, and while they carried their arms and banners 
in Roman fashion, they still retained the indolence and licence of the 
Greek. Anicetus also set fire to the fleet, and, as the sea was not guarded, 
escaped, for Mucianus had brought up to <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> 
the best of the Liburnian ships and all the troops. The barbarians even 
insolently scoured the sea in hastily constructed vessels of their own 
called "camar&aelig;," built with narrow sides and broad bottoms, and joined 
together without fastenings of brass or iron. Whenever the water is rough, 
they raise the bulwarks with additional planks according to the increasing 
height of the waves, till the vessel is covered in like a house. Thus they 
roll about amid the billows, and, as they have a prow at both extremities 
alike and a convertible arrangement of oars, they may be paddled in one 
direction or another indifferently and without risk.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>The matter attracted the attention of Vespasian, 
and induced him to dispatch some veterans from the legions under Virdius 
Geminus, a tried soldier. Finding the enemy in disorder and dispersed in the 
eager pursuit of plunder, he attacked them, and drove them to their ships. 
Hastily fitting out a fleet of Liburnian ships, he pursued Anicetus, and 
overtook him at the mouth of the river <placeName key="tgn,1053343">Cohibus</placeName>, 
where he was protected by the king of the Sedochezi, whose alli-

ance he had secured by a sum of money and other presents. This prince 
at first endeavoured to protect the suppliant by a threat of hostilities; 
when, however, the choice was presented to him between war and the profit to 
be derived from treachery, he consented, with the characteristic perfidy of 
barbarians, to the destruction of Anicetus, and delivered up the refugees. 
So ended this servile war. Amidst the joy of this success, while everything 
was prosperous beyond his hopes, tidings of the victory of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> reached Vespasian in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. This made him hasten his advance to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, for, now that the army of Vitellius was 
shattered, he sought to apply the pressure of famine to the capital, which 
is always dependent on foreign supplies. He was indeed also preparing to 
invade by sea and land the province of <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, which 
lies on the same line of coast, intending by thus closing the supplies of 
corn to cause famine and dissension among the enemy.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>While with this world-wide convulsion the Imperial 
power was changing hands, the conduct of Primus Antonius, after the fall of 
<placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, was by no means as blameless as before. 
Either he believed that the necessities of the war had been satisfied, and 
that all else would follow easily, or, perhaps, success, working on such a 
temperament, developed his latent pride, rapacity, and other vices. He swept 
through <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> as if it were a conquered country, and 
caressed the legions as if they were his own; by all his words and acts he 
sought to pave for himself the way to power. To imbue the army with a spirit 
of licence, he offered to the legions the commissions of the centurions 
killed in the war. By their vote the most turbulent men were elected. The 
soldiers in fact were not under the control of the generals, but the 
generals were themselves constrained to follow the furious impulses of the 
soldiers. These mutinous proceedings, so ruinous to discipline, Antonius 
soon turned to his own profit, regardless of the near approach of Mucianus, 
a neglect more fatal than any contempt for Vespasian.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>As winter was approaching, and the low country was 
 flooded by the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, the army marched on without 
its heavy baggage. The standards and eagles of the victorious legions, the 
old and wounded soldiers, and even many effec-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">FLAVIANIST SOLDIERS DEMORALIZED</note>
tive men, were left at <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>. The auxiliary infantry and cavalry, with some 
picked troops from the legions, appeared sufficient for a war that was all 
but finished. They had been joined by the 11th legion, which at first had 
hesitated, but now in the hour of success felt alarm at having stood aloof. 
A recent levy of 6000 Dalmatians was attached to the legion. They were under 
the command of Pompeius Silvanus, a man of consular rank; the real direction 
of affairs was in the hands of Annius Bassus, the legate of the legion. This 
officer contrived, under an appearance of submission, to govern Silvanus, a 
leader without vigour, and apt to waste in words the opportunities of 
action. Bassus, with his unobtrusive energy, was ready for every thing that 
had to be done. To these forces were added the <emph rend="italic">&eacute;lite</emph> of the marines of the <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName> fleet, who demanded permission to serve in the 
legions. The crews were made up with Dalmatians. The army and generals 
halted at the Temple of Fortune, undecided as to their line of action. They 
had heard that the Pr&aelig;torian Guard had marched out of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and they supposed that the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName> were occupied with troops. The generals, 
finding themselves in a country utterly impoverished by war, were terrified 
by the scarcity of provisions and the mutinous clamours of the soldiery, who 
incessantly demanded the "clavarium," as the donative was called. They had 
provided neither money nor corn, and they were embarrassed by the general 
impatience and rapacity; for what they might have obtained was 
plundered.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>I have the very highest 
authority for asserting, that there was among the conquerors such an impious 
disregard of right and wrong, that a private cavalry soldier declared he had 
slain his brother in the late battle, and claimed a reward from the 
generals. The common law of humanity on the one hand forbade them to reward 
this act of blood, the necessities of the war on the other forbade them to 
punish it. They put him off, on the ground that the obligation was too great 
to be immediately discharged. Nothing more is recorded. In the earlier civil 
wars indeed a similar horror had occurred. In the battle with Cinna at the 
Janiculum, a soldier in Pompey's army, as Sisenna 
tells us, slew his own brother, and, on discovering the horrible deed he had 
com-

mitted, destroyed himself. So much more earnest among our 
ancestors was the honour paid to virtue, and the remorse that waited on 
crime. These and like instances, drawn from the recollections of the past, I 
shall mention not irrelevantly, whenever the subject and the occasion shall 
call for some example of goodness or some solace in the presence of 
evil.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>Antonius and the other generals 
of the party judged it expedient to send forward the cavalry and explore the 
whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003125">Umbria</placeName> for some point where the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName> presented a more gentle ascent, and also to 
 bring up the eagles and standards and all the troops at <placeName key="perseus,Verona">Verona</placeName>, while they were to cover the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> and the sea with convoys. Some there were among 
the generals who were contriving delays, for Antonius in fact was now 
becoming too great a man, and their hopes from Mucianus were more definite. 
That commander, troubled at so speedy a success, and imagining that unless 
he occupied <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in person he should lose all share 
in the glory of the war, continued to write in ambiguous terms to Varus and 
Antonius, enlarging at one time on the necessity of following up their 
operations, at another on the advantage of delay, and with expressions so 
worded that he could, according to the event, repudiate a disastrous, or 
claim a successful policy. To Plotius Griphus, who had lately been raised by 
Vespasian to the senatorial rank and appointed to command a legion, as well 
as to all others on whom he could fully rely, he gave plainer instructions. 
All these men sent replies reflecting unfavourably on the precipitancy of 
Varus and Antonius, and suiting the wishes of Mucianus. By forwarding these 
letters to Vespasian he had accomplished this much, that the measures and 
achievements of Antonius were not valued according to his 
hopes.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>Antonius was indignant, and 
blamed Mucianus, whose calumnies had depreciated his own hazardous 
achievements. Nor was he temperate in his expressions, for he was habitually 
violent in language, and was unaccustomed to obey. He wrote a letter to 
Vespasian in terms more arrogant than should be addressed to an Emperor, and 
not without implied reproach against Mucianus. "It was I," he said, "who 
brought into the field the legions of <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>; my 
instiga-

 tions roused the generals in <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>; my courageous resolution forced a passage 
 through the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, seized on <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and cut off the succours from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName>. The 
discomfiture of the disunited and scattered legions of Vitellius by a fierce 
charge of cavalry, and afterwards by the steady strength of the infantry in 
a conflict that lasted for a day and a night, was indeed a most glorious 
achievement, and it was my work. For the destruction of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> the war must be answerable; the civil strifes of 
former days cost the State more terrible loss and the overthrow of many 
cities. Not with messages and letters, but with my arm and my sword, have I 
served my Emperor. I would not seek to hinder the renown of those who in the 
meanwhile have reduced <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> to tranquillity. They 
 had at heart the peace of <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, I the safety 
 and security of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. By my earnest representations 
<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, the most 
powerful region of the world, have been won for Vespasian. But all my 
efforts have been wasted, if they alone who have not shared the peril obtain 
its rewards." The meaning of all this did not escape Mucianus, and there 
arose a deadly feud, cherished by Antonius with frankness, by Mucianus with 
reserve, and therefore with the greater bitterness.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>Vitellius, after his power had been shattered at 
<placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, endeavoured to suppress the tidings of the 
disaster, and by this foolish attempt at concealment he put off, not indeed 
his troubles, but only the application of the remedy. Had he avowed and 
discussed his position, he had some chance, some strength, left; whereas, on 
the contrary, when he pretended that all was prosperous, he aggravated his 
perils by falsehood. A strange silence was observed in his presence as to 
the war; throughout the country all discussion was prohibited, and so, many 
who would have told the truth had it been allowed, finding it forbidden, 
spread rumours exaggerating the calamity. The generals of the enemy failed 
not to magnify the report of their strength, for they sent back any spies of 
Vitellius whom they captured, after conducting them round the camp in order 
that they might learn the force of the victorious army. All of these persons 
Vitellius questioned in secret, and then ordered that they should be put to 
death. Singular bravery

was displayed by a centurion, Julius 
Agrestis, who, after several interviews, in which he had in vain endeavoured 
to rouse Vitellius to courage, prevailed on the Emperor to send him in 
person to see what was the strength of the enemy's resources, and what had 
happened at <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. He did not seek to escape the 
notice of Antonius by making his observations in secret, but avowed the 
Emperor's instructions and his own purpose, and asked leave to see 
everything. Persons were sent to shew him the field of battle, the remains 
of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and the captured legions. He then made 
his way back to Vitellius, and when the Emperor denied the truth of the 
intelligence which he brought, and even charged him with having been bribed, 
"Since," he replied, "you require some decisive proof, and I can no longer 
serve you in any other way either by my life or death, I will give you a 
proof which you can believe." So he departed, and confirmed his statement by 
a voluntary death. Some say that he was slain by order of Vitellius, but 
they bear the same testimony to his loyalty and courage.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>Vitellius, who seemed like a man roused from 
slumber, ordered Julius Priscus and Alfenius Varus, with fourteen of the 
Pr&aelig;torian cohorts and the entire force of cavalry, to occupy the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName>. A legion of troops drafted from the fleet 
followed. So many thousand troops, comprising the picked men and horses of 
the army, had they been under the direction of a different general, would 
have been quite equal even to aggressive operations. The rest of the 
Pr&aelig;torian cohorts were entrusted to Lucius Vitellius, brother of the 
Emperor, for the defence of the capital. Vitellius, while he abated nothing 
of his habitual indulgence, with a precipitancy prompted by alarm, 
anticipated the elections, at which he appointed consuls for several years. 
With a profuse liberality, he granted treaties to allies, and the rights of 
Latin citizenship to foreigners; some he relieved by the remission of 
tribute, others by exemptions; in a word, utterly careless of the future, he 
mutilated the resources of the Empire. But the mob was attracted by the 
magnificence of his bounties. The most foolish bought these favours with 
money; the wise held that to be invalid, which could neither be given nor 
received without ruin to the

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VITELLIUS' 
FOLLY</note>
State. Yielding at length to the importunity of the army, which 
had taken up its position at <placeName key="tgn,7008876">Mevania</placeName>, and 
accompanied by a numerous train of senators, into which many were brought by 
ambition and more by fear, he entered the camp, undecided in purpose and at 
the mercy of faithless counsels.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p>While 
he was haranguing his troops (marvellous to relate) such a multitude of 
ill-omened birds flew over him, as to obscure with a dark cloud the light of 
day. There occurred another terrible presage. A bull escaped from the altar, 
scattered the preparations for sacrifice, and was finally slain far from the 
spot where the victims are usually struck down. But the most portentous 
spectacle of all was Vitellius himself, ignorant of military matters and 
without forethought in his plans, even asking others about the order of 
march, about the business of reconnoitring, and the discretion to be used in 
pushing on or protracting the campaign, betraying in his countenance and 
gait his alarm at every fresh piece of intelligence, and finally drinking to 
intoxication. At last, weary of the camp, and having received tidings of the 
defection of the fleet at <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName>, he returned to 
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, trembling at every new disaster, but reckless 
 of the final result. For though it was open to him to have crossed the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName> with an army in unimpaired vigour, and to have 
attacked in the field an enemy suffering from cold and scant supplies, yet, 
by dividing his forces, he abandoned to destruction or captivity troops of 
the keenest courage and faithful to the last, against the judgment of the 
most experienced among the centurions, who, had they been consulted, would 
have told him the truth. They were all kept at a distance by the intimate 
friends of Vitellius; for the Emperor's ears were so formed, that all 
profitable counsels were offensive to him, and that he would hear nothing 
but what would please and ruin.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="57"><p>The 
fleet at <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName>, so much can be done in times of 
civil discord by the daring of even a single man, was drawn into revolt by 
Claudius Faventinus, a centurion cashiered by Galba, who forged letters in 
the name of Vespasian offering a reward for treachery. The fleet was under 
the command of Claudius Apollinaris, a man neither firm in his

loyalty, nor energetic in his treason. Apinius Tiro, who had filled 
the office of pr&aelig;tor, and who then happened to be at <placeName key="perseus,Minturnae">Minturn&aelig;</placeName>, offered to head the revolt. By these men 
the colonies and municipal towns were drawn into the movement, and as <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName> was particularly zealous for Vespasian, while 
<placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName> on the other hand remained loyal to Vitellius, 
they introduced their municipal jealousy into the civil war. Claudius 
Julianus, who had lately exercised an indulgent rule over the fleet at <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName>, was selected by Vitellius to soothe the 
irritation of the soldiery. He was supported by a city cohort and a troop of 
gladiators whose chief officer he was. As soon as the two camps were 
pitched, Julianus, without much hesitation, went over to the side of 
Vespasian, and they then occupied <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>, which 
was protected by its fortifications and position rather than by any ability 
of theirs.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>Vitellius, when informed 
of these events, left a portion of his army at <placeName key="perseus,Narnia">Narnia</placeName> under the command of the prefect of the 
Pr&aelig;torian Guard, and deputed his brother Lucius with six cohorts of 
infantry and 500 cavalry to encounter the danger that now threatened him on 
the side of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>. Sick at heart, he found relief 
in the zeal of the soldiers and in the shouts with which the people 
clamoured for arms, while he gave the delusive name of an army and of Roman 
legions to a cowardly mob, that would not venture on any thing beyond words. 
At the instance of his freedmen (for his friends were the less faithful the 
more distinguished their rank) he ordered the tribes to be convoked, and to 
those who gave in their names administered the oath of service. As the 
numbers were excessive, he divided the business of enrolment between the 
consuls. He required the Senators to furnish a prescribed number of slaves 
and a certain weight of silver. The Roman Knights offered their services and 
money, and even the freedmen voluntarily sought the privilege of doing the 
same. This pretence of loyalty, dictated at first by fear, passed into 
enthusiasm, and many expressed compassion, not so much for Vitellius, as for 
the fallen condition of the Imperial power. Vitellius himself failed not to 
draw out their sympathies by his pitiable looks, his voice, and his tears; 
he was liberal in his

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">GENERAL DEFECTION FROM 
VITELLIUS</note>
promises and even extravagant, as men in their alarm 
naturally are. He even expressed a wish to be saluted as C&aelig;sar, a 
title which he had formerly rejected. But now he had a superstitious feeling 
about the name; and it is a fact that in the moment of terror the counsels 
of the wise and the voice of the rabble are listened to with equal respect. 
But as all movements that originate in thoughtless impulse, however vigorous 
in their beginnings, become feeble after a time, the throng of Senators and 
Knights gradually melted away, dispersing at first tardily and during the 
absence of the Emperor, but before long with a contemptuous indifference to 
his presence, till, ashamed of the failure of his efforts, Vitellius waived 
his claims to services which were not offered.</p></div2>
 <div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>As the occupation of <placeName key="tgn,7008876">Mevania</placeName>, and the 
apparent revival of the war with new vigour, had struck terror into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, so now did the timorous retreat of Vitellius give 
an unequivocal bias in favour of the Flavianists. The Samnites, the Peligni, 
and the Marsi, roused themselves, jealous at having been anticipated by <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, and, as men who serve a new master, were 
energetic in all the duties of war. The army, however, was much distressed 
by bad weather in its passage over the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName>, 
and since they could hardly struggle through the snow, though their march 
was unmolested, they perceived what danger they would have had to encounter, 
had not Vitellius been made to turn back by that good fortune, which, not 
less often than the wisdom of their counsels, helped the Flavianist 
generals. Here they fell in with Petilius Cerialis, who had escaped the 
sentries of Vitellius by a rustic disguise and by his knowledge of the 
country. There was a near relationship between Cerialis and Vespasian, and 
he was not without reputation as a soldier. He was therefore admitted to 
rank among the generals. It has been said by many that the means of escape 
were likewise open to Flavius Sabinus and to Domitian, and indeed 
messengers, dispatched by Antonius, contrived under various disguises to 
make their way to them, offering them a place of refuge and a protecting 
force. Sabinus pleaded his ill health, unsuited to toil and adventure. 
Domitian did not want the courage, but he feared that the guards whom

Vitellius had set over him, though they offered to accompany him in 
his flight, had treacherous designs. And Vitellius himself, out of a regard 
for his own connexions, did not meditate any cruelty against 
Domitian.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p>The Flavianist generals on 
their arrival at <placeName key="perseus,Carsulae">Carsul&aelig;</placeName> took a few days for 
repose, while the eagles and standards of the legions were coming up. <placeName key="perseus,Carsulae">Carsul&aelig;</placeName> appeared a good position for an 
encampment, for it commanded an extensive prospect, provisions could be 
safely brought up, and there were in its rear several very wealthy towns. 
They also calculated on interviews with the Vitellianists, who were only ten 
miles distant, and on the chances of defection. The soldiers were 
dissatisfied with this prospect, and wished for victory rather than for 
peace. They would not even await the arrival of their own legions, whom they 
looked upon as sharers in the spoil rather than in the dangers of the 
campaign. Antonius summoned them to an assembly, and explained to them that 
Vitellius had still forces, which would waver in their loyalty if they had 
time to reflect, but would be fierce foes if driven to despair. "The opening 
of a civil war must," he said, "be left to chance; the final triumph is 
perfected by wise counsels and skill. The fleet of <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName> and the fairest portion of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName> have already revolted, and out of the whole 
world Vitellius has nothing left but the country between <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Narnia">Narnia</placeName>. From our 
victory at <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> sufficient glory has accrued to 
us, and from the destruction of that city only too much disgrace. Let us not 
be eager to capture rather than to preserve the capital. Greater will be our 
reward, far higher our reputation, if we secure without bloodshed the safety 
of the Senate and of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>." By this 
and similar language their impatience was allayed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>Soon after, the legions arrived. Alarmed by the 
report of this increase to the army, the Vitellianist cohorts began to 
waver; no one urged them to fight, many urged them to change sides, each 
more eager than the other to hand over his company or troop, a present to 
the conqueror, and a source of future advantage to himself. From these men 
it was ascertained that <placeName key="perseus,Interamna Nahars">Interamna</placeName>, situated in the 
adjoining plain, was occupied by a garrison of 400 cavalry. Varus was

at once 
dispatched with a lightly equipped force, and cut to pieces a few who 
attempted to resist; the greater number threw down their arms, and begged 
for quarter. Some fled back into the camp, and spread panic everywhere by 
exaggerated reports of the courage and strength of the enemy, seeking thus 
to mitigate the disgrace of having lost the position. Among the 
Vitellianists treason went unpunished; all loyalty was subverted by the 
rewards of desertion, and nothing was left but emulation in perfidy. There 
were numerous desertions among the tribunes and centurions; the common 
soldiers remained obstinately faithful to Vitellius, till Priscus and 
Alfenius, deserting the camp and returning to Vitellius, relieved all from 
any shame they might feel at being traitors.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>About the same time Fabius Valens was put to death while in 
confinement at <placeName key="perseus,Urvinum Metaurense">Urbinum</placeName>. His head was displayed to 
the Vitellianist cohorts, that they might not cherish any further hope, for 
they generally believed that Valens had made his way into <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and was there bringing into the field veteran 
as well as newly levied armies. The bloody spectacle reduced them to 
despair, and it was amazing how the army of Vespasian welcomed in their 
hearts the destruction of Valens as the termination of the war. Valens was a 
native of <placeName key="perseus,Anagnia">Anagnia</placeName>, and belonged to an Equestrian 
family; he was a man of loose character, but of no small ability, who sought 
to gain by profligacy a reputation for elegance. In the theatricals 
performed by young men during the reign of <persName>Nero</persName>, at first apparently from 
compulsion, afterwards of his own free choice, he repeatedly acted in the 
farces, with more cleverness than propriety. While legate of a legion, he 
first supported, then slandered, Verginius. Fonteius Capito he murdered, 
either after he had corrupted him, or because he had failed to do so. Though 
a traitor to Galba he was loyal to Vitellius, and gained a lustre from the 
perfidy of others.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>Finding all their 
hopes cut off, the troops of Vitellius, intending to pass over to the side 
of the conqueror, but to do so with honour, marched down with their 
standards and colours into the plains beneath <placeName key="perseus,Narnia">Narnia</placeName>. The army of Vespasian, prepared and equipped as 
if for action, was drawn

up in dense array on both sides of the 
road. The Vitellianists were received between the two columns; when they 
were thus surrounded, Antonius addressed them kindly. One division was 
ordered to remain at <placeName key="perseus,Narnia">Narnia</placeName>, another at <placeName key="perseus,Interamna Nahars">Interamna</placeName>; with them were left some of the victorious 
legions, which would not be formidable to them if they remained quiet, but 
were strong enough to crush all turbulence. At the same time <persName>Primus</persName> and 
Varus did not neglect to forward continual messages to Vitellius, offering 
him personal safety, the enjoyment of wealth, and a quiet retreat in <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, provided he would lay down his arms and 
surrender himself and his children to Vespasian. Mucianus also wrote to him 
to the same effect, and Vitellius was often disposed to trust these 
overtures, and even discussed the number of his household and the choice of 
a residence on the coast. Such a lethargy had come over his spirit, that, 
had not others remembered he had been an Emperor, he would have himself 
forgotten it.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>The leading men in the 
State had secret conferences with Flavius Sabinus, prefect of the city, 
urging him to secure a share in the credit of the victory. "You have," they 
said, "a force of your own in the city cohorts; the cohorts of the watch 
will not fail you, and there are also our own slaves, there is the prestige 
of the party, there is the fact that to the victorious every thing is easy. 
You should not yield the glory of the war to Antonius and Varus. Vitellius 
has but a few cohorts, and they are alarmed by gloomy tidings from every 
quarter. The feelings of the people are easily swayed, and, if you put 
yourself at their head, there will soon be the same flatteries ready for 
Vespasian. Vitellius even in prosperity was unequal to his position, and he 
is proportionately unnerved by disaster. The merit of having finished the 
war will belong to him who may have possessed himself of the capital. It 
would well become Sabinus to keep the Empire for his brother, and Vespasian 
equally well, to count his other adherents inferior to Sabinus."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>Old and infirm as he was, it was with any 
thing but eagerness that he listened to these suggestions. Some indeed 
assailed him with dark insinuations, implying that from motives of envy and 
rivalry he was seeking to retard the ele-

vation of his brother. It 
was true, that while both were in a private station, Flavius Sabinus, who 
was the elder, was the superior of Vespasian in influence and in wealth. He 
was believed indeed to have sustained the failing credit of his brother, 
while taking a mortgage of his house and lands; and hence, though the 
outward appearance of harmony was preserved, some secret grudge was feared. 
It is more charitable to suppose that the mild temper of the man shrank from 
bloodshed and slaughter, and that for this reason he had held frequent 
conferences with Vitellius to discuss the question of peace and the 
cessation of hostilities upon certain conditions. After many private 
interviews, they finally, so report said, ratified an agreement in the 
temple of Apollo. The words of their conversation had two witnesses in 
Cluvius Rufus and Silius Italicus. Their looks were noted by the more 
distant spectators; the expression of Vitellius was abject and mean, that of 
Sabinus not triumphant, but rather akin to pity.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>Could Vitellius have swayed the feelings of his partisans as 
easily as he had himself yielded, the army of Vespasian might have entered 
the capital without bloodshed. But the more loyal his adherents, the more 
did they protest against peace and negotiation. They pointed out the danger 
and disgrace of a submission in which the caprice of the conqueror would be 
their sole guarantee. "And Vespasian," they said, "is not so arrogant as to 
tolerate such a subject as Vitellius. Even the vanquished would not endure 
it. Their pity would be dangerous to him. You certainly are an old man, and 
have had enough both of prosperity and of adversity, but think what a name, 
what a position, you will leave to your son Germanicus. Now indeed they 
promise you wealth, and a large establishment, and a luxurious retreat in 
 <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>; but when Vespasian has once seized the 
throne, neither he, nor his friends, nor even his armies, will feel 
themselves secure till all rivalry has been extinguished. Fabius Valens, 
captive as he was, and reserved against the chance of disaster, was yet too 
formidable to them; and certainly <persName>Primus</persName>, Fuscus, and Mucianus, who exhibits 
the temper of his party, will not be allowed power over Vitellius except to 
put him to death. C&aelig;sar did not leave Pompey,

Augustus did 
not leave Antony in safety, though, perhaps, Vespasian may show a more lofty 
spirit, Vespasian, who was a dependant of Vitellius, when Vitellius was the 
colleague of Claudius. If you would act as becomes the censorship, the 
thrice-repeated consulate of your father, and all the honours of your 
illustrious house, let despair at any rate arm you to courageous action. The 
troops are still firm, and among the people there is abundant zeal. Lastly, 
nothing can happen to us more terrible than that upon which we are 
voluntarily rushing. If we are conquered, we must die; we must die, if we 
capitulate. All that concerns us is this; shall we draw our last breath 
amidst scorn and insult, or in a valiant struggle?"</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p>The ears of Vitellius were deaf to manly counsels. 
His whole soul was overwhelmed by a tender anxiety, lest by an obstinate 
resistance he might leave the conqueror less mercifully disposed to his wife 
and children. He had also a mother old and feeble, but she, expiring a few 
days before, escaped by her opportune death the ruin of her house, having 
gained from the Imperial dignity of her son nothing but sorrow and a good 
name. On the 18th of December, after hearing of the defection of the legion 
and the auxiliary infantry which had surrendered at <placeName key="perseus,Narnia">Narnia</placeName>, he left the palace, clad in mourning robes, and 
surrounded by his weeping household. With him went his little son, carried 
in a litter, as though in a funeral procession. The greetings of the people 
were flattering, but ill-suited to the time; the soldiers preserved an 
ominous silence.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>There could hardly 
be a man so careless of human interests as not to be affected by this 
spectacle. There was the Roman Emperor, lord but a few days before of the 
whole human race, leaving the seat of his power, and passing through the 
midst of his people and his capital, to abdicate his throne. Men had never 
before seen or heard of such an event. C&aelig;sar, the Dictator, had fallen 
by sudden violence, Caligula by secret treason. The shades of night and the 
obscurity of a rural hiding-place had veiled the flight of <persName>Nero</persName>. <persName>Piso</persName> and 
Galba had, it might be said, fallen in battle. In an assembly of his own 
people, and in the midst of his own soldiers, with the very women of his 
family looking on,

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">NOT PERMITTED TO 
ABDICATE</note>
Vitellius stood and spoke a few words suitable to the sad 
conjuncture. "He gave way," he said, "for the sake of peace, for the sake of 
his country; let them only remember him, and think with compassion of his 
brother, of his wife, of his young and innocent children." At the same time 
he held out his son, commending him first to individual bystanders, then to 
the whole assembly. At last, unable to speak for weeping, he unfastened the 
dagger from his side, and offered it to the Consul, C&aelig;cilius Simplex, 
who was standing by him, as if to indicate that he surrendered the power of 
life and death over the citizens. The Consul rejecting it, and those who 
were standing by in the assembly shouting remonstrance, he departed, as if 
with the intention of laying aside the emblems of Imperial power in the 
Temple of Concord, and of betaking himself to his brother's house. Louder 
shouts here met him from the crowd, which hindered him from entering a 
private house, and invited him to return to the palace. Every other route 
was closed, and the only one open was one which led into the <placeName>Via Sacra</placeName>. Then in utter perplexity he returned to the 
palace. The rumour that he had renounced the Imperial dignity had preceded 
him thither, and Flavius Sabinus had sent written orders to the tribunes of 
the cohorts to keep their soldiers under restraint.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p>Then, as if the whole State had passed into the 
hands of Vespasian, the leading men of the Senate, many of the Equestrian 
order, with all the city soldiery and the watch, thronged the dwelling of 
Sabinus. Intelligence was there brought to him of the enthusiasm of the 
populace and of the threatening attitude of the German cohorts. He had now 
gone too far to be able to retreat, and every one, fearing for himself, 
should the Vitellianists come upon them while they were scattered and 
comparatively weak, urged him, in spite of his reluctance, to hostilities. 
As usually happens, however, in such cases, all gave the advice, but few 
shared the risk. The armed retinue which was escorting Sabinus was met, as 
it was coming down by the <placeName>Lake Fundanus</placeName>, by some of 
the most determined of the Vitellianists. From this unforeseen collision 
resulted an encounter slight indeed, but terminating favourably for the 
Vitellianists. In the hurry of the moment Sabinus adopted the safest course 
open to him,

and occupied the Capitol with a miscellaneous body 
of soldiery, and some Senators and Knights. It is not easy to give the names 
of these persons, since after the triumph of Vespasian many pretended to 
have rendered this service to his party. There were even women who braved 
the dangers of the siege; the most conspicuous among them being Verulana 
Gratilla, who was taken thither, not by the love of children or kindred, but 
by the fascination of war. The Vitellianists kept but a careless watch over 
the besieged, and thus at the dead of night Sabinus was able to bring into 
the Capitol his own children and Domitian his brother's son, and to send by 
an unguarded route a messenger to the generals of the Flavianist party, with 
information that they were besieged, and that, unless succour arrived, they 
must be reduced to distress. The night passed so quietly that he might have 
quitted the place without loss; for, brave as were the soldiers of Vitellius 
in encountering danger, they were far from attentive to the laborious duties 
of watching. Besides this, the sudden fall of a winter storm baffled both 
sight and hearing.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="70"><p>At dawn of day, 
before either side commenced hostilities, Sabinus sent Cornelius Martialis, 
a centurion of the first rank, to Vitellius, with instructions to complain 
of the infraction of the stipulated terms. "There has evidently," he said, 
"been a mere show and pretence of abdicating the Empire, with the view of 
deceiving a number of distinguished men. If not, why, when leaving the 
Rostra, had he gone to the house of his brother, looking as it did over the 
Forum, and certain to provoke the gaze of the multitude, rather than to the 
 <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>, and the family house of his wife? This 
would have befitted a private individual anxious to shun all appearance of 
Imperial power. But on the contrary, Vitellius retraced his steps to the 
palace, the very stronghold of Empire; thence issued a band of armed men. 
One of the most frequented parts of the city was strewed with the corpses of 
innocent persons. The Capitol itself had not been spared. "I," said Sabinus, 
"was only a civilian and a member of the Senate, while the rivalry of 
Vitellius and Vespasian was being settled by conflicts between legions, by 
the capture of cities, by the capitulation of cohorts; with

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">FLAVIANISTS OCCUPY CAPITOL</note>
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, 
 <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> in 
revolt, the brother of Vespasian still remained firm to his allegiance, till 
actually invited to discuss terms of agreement. Peace and harmony bring 
advantage to the conquered, but only credit to the conqueror. If you repent 
of your compact, it is not against me, whom you treacherously deceived, that 
you must draw the sword, nor is it against the son of Vespasian, who is yet 
of tender age. What would be gained by the slaughter of one old man and one 
stripling? You should go and meet the legions, and fight there for Empire; 
everything else will follow the issue of that struggle." To these 
representations the embarrassed Vitellius answered a few words in his own 
exculpation, throwing all the blame upon the soldiers, with whose excessive 
zeal his moderation was, he said, unable to cope. He advised Martialis to 
depart unobserved through a concealed part of the palace, lest he should be 
killed by the soldiers, as the negotiator of this abhorred convention. 
Vitellius had not now the power either to command or to forbid. He was no 
longer Emperor, he was merely the cause of war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>Martialis had hardly returned to the Capitol, when the 
infuriated soldiery arrived, without any leader, every man acting on his own 
impulse. They hurried at quick march past the Forum and the temples which 
hang over it and advanced their line up the opposite hill as far as the 
outer gates of the Capitol. There were formerly certain colonnades on the 
right side of the slope as one went up; the defenders, issuing forth on the 
roof of these buildings showered tiles and stones on the Vitellianists. The 
assailants were not armed with anything but swords, and it seemed too 
tedious to send for machines and missiles. They threw lighted brands on a 
projecting colonnade, and following the track of the fire would have burst 
through the half-burnt gates of the Capitol, had not Sabinus, tearing down 
on all sides the statues, the glories of former generations, formed them 
into a barricade across the opening. They then assailed the opposite 
approaches to the Capitol, near the grove of the Asylum, and where the Tarpeian rock is mounted by a hundred steps. Both these 
attacks were unexpected; the closer and fiercer of the two threatened the 
Asylum. The

assailants could not be checked as they mounted the 
continuous line of buildings, which, as was natural in a time of profound 
peace, had grown up to such a height as to be on a level with the soil of 
the Capitol. A doubt arises at this point, whether it was the assailants who 
threw lighted brands on to the roofs, or whether, as the more general 
account has it, the besieged thus sought to repel the assailants, who were 
now making vigorous progress. From them the fire passed to the colonnades 
adjoining the temples; the eagles supporting the pediment, which were of old 
timber, caught the flames. And so the Capitol, with its gates shut, neither 
defended by friends, nor spoiled by a foe, was burnt to the ground.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>This was the most deplorable and disgraceful 
event that had happened to the Commonwealth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> 
since the foundation of the city; for now, assailed by no foreign enemy, 
with Heaven ready to be propitious, had our vices only allowed, the seat of 
<persName>Jupiter</persName> Supremely Good and Great, founded by our ancestors with solemn 
auspices to be the pledge of Empire, the seat, which neither Porsenna, when 
the city was surrendered, nor the Gauls, when it was captured, had been able 
to violate, was destroyed by the madness of our Emperors. Once before indeed 
during civil war the Capitol had been consumed by fire, but then only 
through the crime of individuals; now it was openly besieged, and openly set 
on fire. And what were the motives of this conflict? what the compensation 
for so great a disaster? was it for our country we were fighting? King 
Tarquinius Priscus had vowed its erection in his war with the Sabines, and 
had laid the foundations on a scale which suited the hopes of future 
greatness rather than what the yet moderate resources of <placeName>Rome</placeName> could achieve. After him, Servius Tullius, heartily 
assisted by the allies, and Tarquinius Superbus, employing the spoils of war 
from the conquered Suessa Pometia, raised the superstructure. But the glory 
of its completion was reserved for the days of liberty. After the expulsion 
of the Kings, Horatius Pulvillus, in his second consulate, dedicated it, a 
building so magnificent, that the vast wealth afterwards acquired by the 
people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> served to embellish rather than 
increase it. It was re-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CAPITOL 
BURNED</note>
built on the same site, when, after an interval of 415 years, 
it was burnt to the ground in the consulate of Lucius Scipio and Caius 
Norbanus. Sulla, after his final triumph, undertook the charge of restoring 
it, but did not live to dedicate it, the one thing denied to his uniform 
good fortune. The name of Lutatius Catulus, the dedicator, remained among 
all the vast erections of the Emperors, down to the days of Vitellius. This 
was the building that was now on fire.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>The catastrophe, however, caused more panic among the besieged 
than among the besiegers. In fact, the troops of Vitellius lacked neither 
skill nor courage in the midst of peril. Opposed to them were soldiers 
without self-possession, and a spiritless and, so to speak, infatuated 
commander, who had not the use of his tongue or his ears, who would not be 
guided by other men's counsels, and could not carry out his own, who, 
hurried to and fro by the shouts of the enemy, forbade what he had just 
ordered, and ordered what he had just forbidden. Then, as usually happens 
when everything is lost, all gave orders, and no one obeyed. At last, they 
threw away their arms, and began to look about for ways of escape and means 
of concealment. The Vitellianists burst in, carrying everywhere with 
indiscriminate ferocity the firebrand and the sword. A few of the military 
men, among whom the most conspicuous were Cornelius Martialis, &AElig;milius 
Pacensis, Casperius Niger, and Didius Sceva, ventured to resist, and were 
cut down. Flavius Sabinus, who was unarmed, and who did not attempt to fly, 
was surrounded, and with him the consul Quinctius Atticus, marked out by his 
clinging to the shadow of office, and by his folly in having scattered among 
the people edicts highly eulogistic of Vespasian and insulting to Vitellius. 
The rest escaped by various chances, some disguised as slaves, others 
concealed by the fidelity of dependants, and hiding among the baggage. Some 
caught the watchword by which the Vitellianists recognised each other, and, 
themselves challenging others and giving it when challenged, found in their 
audacity an effectual disguise.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>When 
the enemy first burst in, Domitian concealed himself in the house of a 
servant of the temple. At the ingenious suggestion of a freedman, he assumed 
a linen vest-

ment, and passing unnoticed among a crowd of 
acolytes, found a refuge with Cornelius Primus, one of his father's 
dependants, in a house near the Velabrum. When his 
father mounted the throne, he pulled down the chamber of the temple-servant, 
and built a small chapel, dedicated to <persName>Jupiter</persName> the Preserver, with an altar 
on which his own adventures were represented in marble. Afterwards, on his 
own accession to the Imperial power, he consecrated a vast temple to Jupiter 
the Guardian, with an effigy of himself in the arms of the god. Sabinus and 
Atticus were loaded with chains, and conducted to Vitellius, who received 
them with anything but anger in his words and looks, amidst the murmurs of 
those who demanded the privilege of slaying them and their pay for the work 
they had done. Those who were standing near began the clamour, and the 
degraded rabble cried out for the execution of Sabinus, and mingled threats 
with their flatteries. Vitellius, who was standing before the steps of the 
palace, and was preparing to intercede, was induced to desist. The body of 
Sabinus, pierced and mutilated and with the head severed from it, was 
dragged to the Gemoni&aelig;.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p>Such 
was the end of a man in no wise contemptible. In five and thirty campaigns 
he had served the State, and had gained distinction both at home and abroad. 
His blamelessness and integrity no one could question. He was somewhat 
boastful; this was the only fault of which rumour accused him in the seven 
years during which he had governed <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, and 
the twelve during which he was prefect of the city. In the closing scene of 
his life some have seen pusillanimity, many a moderate temper, sparing of 
the blood of his countrymen. One thing is allowed by all, that, before the 
accession of Vespasian, the distinction of the family was centred in 
Sabinus. I have heard that his death gratified Mucianus, and many indeed 
asserted that the interests of peace were promoted by the removal of the 
rivalry between these two men, one of whom felt himself to be the brother of 
the Emperor, while the other thought himself his colleague. Vitellius 
resisted the demands of the people for the execution of the Consul; he was 
now pacified, and wished, it would seem, to recompense Atticus, who, when 
asked who

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VESPASIAN'S BROTHER KILLED</note>
had 
set fire to the Capitol, had confessed his own guilt, and by this 
confession, which may indeed have been an opportune falsehood, was thought 
to have taken upon himself the odium of the crime, and to have acquitted the 
Vitellianist party.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="76"><p>Meanwhile Lucius 
Vitellius, who was encamped near Feronia, was threatening <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName> with destruction. There were shut up in the 
place a few gladiators and seamen, who dared not leave the walls and risk an 
engagement in the plain. I have mentioned before that Julianus was in 
command of the gladiators, Apollinaris of the seamen, two men whose 
profligacy and indolence made them resemble gladiators rather than generals. 
They kept no watch; they did not strengthen the weak points of the 
fortifications; but, making each pleasant spot ring with the noise of their 
daily and nightly dissipation, they dispersed their soldiers on errands 
which were to minister to their luxury, and never spoke of war, except at 
their banquets. Apinius Tiro had quitted the place a few days before, and 
was now, by the harsh exaction of presents and contributions from the towns, 
adding to the unpopularity rather than to the resources of his party.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="77"><p>Meanwhile a slave belonging to Verginius 
Capito deserted to L. Vitellius and having engaged, on being furnished with 
a force, to put him in possession of the unoccupied citadel, proceeded at a 
late hour of the night to place some light-armed cohorts on the summit of a 
range of hills which commanded the enemy's position. From this place the 
troops descended to what was more a massacre than a conflict. Many whom they 
slew were unarmed or in the act of arming themselves, some were just awaking 
from sleep, amid the confusion of darkness and panic, the braying of 
trumpets, and the shouts of the foe. A few of the gladiators resisted, and 
fell not altogether unavenged. The rest made a rush for the ships, where 
everything was involved in a general panic, the troops being mingled with 
country people, whom the Vitellianists slaughtered indiscriminately. Six 
Liburnian ships with Apollinaris, prefect of the fleet, escaped in the first 
confusion. The rest were either seized upon the beach, or were swamped by 
the weight of the crowds that

rushed on board. Julianus was 
brought before L. Vitellius, and, after being ignominiously scourged, was 
put to death in his presence. Some persons accused Triaria, the wife of L. 
Vitellius, of having armed herself with a soldier's sword, and of having 
behaved with arrogance and cruelty amid the horrors and massacres of the 
storm of <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>. Lucius himself sent to his 
brother a laurelled dispatch with an account of his success, and asked 
whether he wished him at once to return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or 
 to complete the subjugation of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>. This 
circumstance was advantageous to the State as well as to the cause of 
Vespasian. Had the army fresh from victory, and with all the pride of 
success added to its natural obstinacy, marched upon <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, a conflict of no slight magnitude, and involving 
the destruction of the capital, must have ensued. Lucius Vitellius, infamous 
as he was, had yet some energy, but it was not through his virtues, as is 
the case with the good, but through his vices, that he, like the worst of 
villains, was formidable.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="78"><p>While these 
successes were being achieved on the side of Vitellius, the army of 
Vespasian had left <placeName key="perseus,Narnia">Narnia</placeName>, and was passing the 
holiday of the Saturnalia in idleness at <placeName key="perseus,Ocriculum">Ocriculum</placeName>. 
The reason alleged for so injurious a delay was that they might wait for 
Mucianus. Some persons indeed there were who assailed Antonius with 
insinuations, that he lingered with treacherous intent, after receiving 
private letters from Vitellius, which conveyed to him the offer of the 
consulship and of the Emperor's daughter in marriage with a vast dowry, as 
the price of treason. Others asserted that this was all a fiction, invented 
to please Mucianus. Some again alleged that the policy agreed upon by all 
the generals was to threaten rather than actually to attack the capital, as 
Vitellius' strongest cohorts had revolted from him, and it seemed likely 
that, deprived of all support, he would abdicate the throne, but that the 
whole plan was ruined by the impatience and subsequent cowardice of Sabinus, 
who, after rashly taking up arms, had not been able to defend against three 
cohorts the great stronghold of the Capitol, which might have defied even 
the mightiest armies. One cannot, however, easily fix upon one man the blame 
which belongs to all. Mucianus did in fact delay the conquerors by 
ambig-

FLAVIANISTS</note>
uously-worded dispatches; Antonius, by a perverse 
acquiescence, or by an attempt to throw the odium upon another, laid himself 
open to blame; the other generals, by imagining that the war was over, 
contrived a distinction for its closing scene. Even Petilius Cerialis, 
though he had been sent on with a thousand cavalry by cross roads through 
the Sabine district so as to enter <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by the Via Salaria, had not been sufficiently prompt in his 
movements, when the report of the siege of the Capitol put all alike on the 
alert.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="79"><p>Antonius marched by the <placeName key="tgn,6006327">Via Flaminia</placeName>, and arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Ad Saxa Rubra">Saxa 
Rubra</placeName>, when the night was far spent, too late to give any help. There 
he received nothing but gloomy intelligence, that Sabinus was dead, that the 
Capitol had been burnt to the ground, that <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was 
in consternation, and also that the populace and the slaves were arming 
themselves for Vitellius. And Petilius Cerialis had been defeated in a 
cavalry skirmish. While he was hurrying on without caution, as against a 
vanquished enemy, the Vitellianists, who had disposed some infantry among 
their cavalry, met him. The conflict took place not far from the city among 
buildings, gardens, and winding lanes, which were well known to the 
Vitellianists, but disconcerting to their opponents, to whom they were 
strange. Nor indeed were all the cavalry one in heart, for there were with 
them some who had lately capitulated at <placeName key="perseus,Narnia">Narnia</placeName>, and 
who were anxiously watching the fortunes of the rival parties. Tullius 
Flavianus, commanding a squadron, was taken prisoner; the rest fled in 
disgraceful confusion, but the victors did not continue the pursuit beyond 
<placeName>Fiden&aelig;</placeName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="80"><p>By this success the zeal of the people was increased. The mob of the city 
armed itself. Some few had military shields, the greater part seized such 
arms as came to hand, and loudly demanded the signal of battle. Vitellius 
expressed his thanks to them, and bade them sally forth to defend the 
capital. Then the Senate was called together, and envoys were selected to 
meet the armies and urge them in the name of the Commonwealth to union and 
peace. The reception of these envoys was not everywhere the same. Those who 
fell in with Petilius Cerialis were exposed to extreme peril, for the troops 
disdained all offers of peace. The pr&aelig;tor Arulenus

Rusticus 
was wounded. This deed seemed all the more atrocious, when, over and above 
the insult offered to the dignity of the envoy and pr&aelig;tor, men 
considered the private worth of the man. His companions were dispersed, and 
the lictor that stood next to him, venturing to push aside the crowd, was 
killed. Had they not been protected by an escort provided by the general, 
the dignity of the ambassador, respected even by foreign nations, would have 
been profaned with fatal violence by the madness of Roman citizens before 
the very walls of their Country. The envoys who met Antonious were more 
favourably received, not because the troops were of quieter temper, but 
because the general had more authority.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="81"><p>One Musonius Rufus, a man of equestrian rank, strongly attached 
to the pursuit of philosophy and to the tenets of the Stoics, had joined the 
envoys. He mingled with the troops, and, enlarging on the blessings of peace 
and the perils of war, began to admonish the armed crowd. Many thought it 
ridiculous; more thought it tiresome; some were ready to throw him down and 
trample him under foot, had he not yielded to the warnings of the more 
orderly and the threats of others, and ceased to display his ill-timed 
wisdom. The Vestal virgins also presented themselves with a letter from 
Vitellius to Antonius. He asked for one day of truce before the final 
struggle, and said, that if they would permit some delay to intervene, 
everything might be more easily arranged. The sacred virgins were sent back 
with honour, but the answer returned to Vitellius was, that all ordinary 
intercourse of war had been broken off by the murder of Sabinus and the 
conflagration of the Capitol.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="82"><p>Antonius, however, summoned the legions to an assembly, and endeavoured to 
calm them, proposing that they should encamp near the Mulvian bridge, and enter the capital on the following 
day. His reason for delay was the fear that the soldiers, once exasperated 
by conflict, would respect neither the people nor the Senate, nor even the 
shrines and temples of the Gods. They, however, looked with dislike on all 
procrastination as inimical to victory. At the same time the colours that 
glittered among the hills, though followed by an unwarlike population, 
presented the appearance of a

WALLS OF <placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName></note>
hostile array. They advanced in 
three divisions, one column straight from where they had halted along the 
 <placeName key="tgn,6006327">Via Flaminia</placeName>, another along the bank of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, a third moved on the Colline 
Gate by the Via Salaria. The mob was routed by 
a charge of the cavalry. Then the Vitellianist troops, themselves also drawn 
up in three columns of defence, met the foe. Numerous engagements with 
various issue took place before the walls, but they generally ended in 
favour of the Flavianists, who had the advantage of more skilful 
generalship. Only that division suffered which had wound its way along 
narrow and slippery roads to the left quarter of the city as far as the 
gardens of Sallust. The Vitellianists, taking their stand on the 
garden-walls, kept off the assailants with stones and javelins till late in 
the day, when they were taken in the rear by the cavalry, which had then 
forced an entrance by the Colline Gate. In the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> also the hostile armies met, the 
Flavianists with all the prestige of fortune and repeated victory, the 
Vitellianists rushing on in sheer despair. Though defeated, they rallied 
again in the city.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="83"><p>The populace stood 
by and watched the combatants; and, as though it had been a mimic conflict, 
encouraged first one party and then the other by their shouts and plaudits. 
Whenever either side gave way, they cried out that those who concealed 
themselves in the shops, or took refuge in any private house, should be 
dragged out and butchered, and they secured the larger share of the booty; 
for, while the soldiers were busy with bloodshed and massacre, the spoils 
fell to the crowd. It was a terrible and hideous sight that presented itself 
throughout the city. Here raged battle and death; there the bath and the 
tavern were crowded. In one spot were pools of blood and heaps of corpses, 
and close by prostitutes and men of character as infamous; there were all 
the debaucheries of luxurious peace, all the horrors of a city most cruelly 
sacked, till one was ready to believe the Country to be mad at once with 
rage and lust. It was not indeed the first time that armed troops had fought 
within the city; they had done so twice when Sulla, once when Cinna 
triumphed. The bloodshed then had not been less, but now there was an 
unnatural recklessness, and men's pleasures

were not interrupted 
even for a moment. As if it were a new delight added to their holidays, they 
exulted in and enjoyed the scene, indifferent to parties, and rejoicing over 
the sufferings of the Commonwealth.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="84"><p>The most arduous struggle was the storming of the camp, which the bravest of 
the enemy still held as a last hope. It was, therefore, with peculiar energy 
that the conquerors, among whom the veteran cohorts were especially forward, 
brought to bear upon it at once all the appliances which have been 
discovered in reducing the strongest cities, the testudo, the catapult, the 
earth-work, and the firebrand. They repeatedly shouted "that all the toil 
and danger they had endured in so many conflicts would be crowned by this 
achievement. The capital has been restored to the Senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and their temples to the Gods; but the soldier's 
peculiar distinction is in the camp; this is his country, and this his home; 
unless this be recovered forthwith, the night must be passed under arms." On 
the other hand the Vitellianists, though unequal in numbers and doomed to 
defeat, could yet disturb the victory, delay the conclusion of peace, and 
pollute both hearth and altar with blood; and they clung to these last 
consolations of the vanquished. Many, desperately wounded, breathed their 
last on the towers and ramparts. When the gates were torn down, the 
survivors threw themselves in a body on the conquerors, and fell to a man, 
with their wounds in front and their faces turned towards the foe, so 
anxious were they even in their last hours to die with honour. When the city 
had been taken, Vitellius caused himself to be carried in a litter through 
the back of the palace to the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>, to his 
wife's dwelling, intending, if by any concealment he could escape for that 
day, to make his way to his brother's cohorts at <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>. Then, with characteristic weakness, and 
following the instincts of fear, which, dreading everything, shrinks most 
from what is immediately before it, he retraced his steps to the desolate 
and forsaken palace, whence even the meanest slaves had fled, or where they 
avoided his presence. The solitude and silence of the place scared him; he 
tried the closed doors, he shuddered in the empty chambers, till, wearied 
out with his miserable wanderings, he concealed

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DEATH OF VITELLIUS</note>
himself in an unseemly hiding-place, 
from which he was dragged out by the tribune Julius Placidus. His hands were 
bound behind his back, and he was led along with tattered robes, a revolting 
spectacle, amidst the invectives of many, the tears of none. The degradation 
of his end had extinguished all pity. One of the German soldiers met the 
party, and aimed a deadly blow at Vitellius, perhaps in anger, perhaps 
wishing to release him the sooner from insult. Possibly the blow was meant 
for the Tribune. He struck off that officer's ear, and was immediately 
dispatched.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="85"><p>Vitellius, compelled by 
threatening swords, first to raise his face and offer it to insulting blows, 
then to behold his own statues falling round him, and more than once to look 
at the Rostra and the spot where Galba was slain was then driven along till 
they reached the Gemoni&aelig;, the place where the corpse of Flavius 
Sabinus had lain. One speech was heard from him shewing a spirit not utterly 
degraded, when to the insults of a tribune he answered, "Yet I was your 
Emperor." Then he fell under a shower of blows, and the mob reviled the dead 
man with the same heartlessness with which they had flattered him when he 
was alive.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="86"><p><placeName key="tgn,7004118">Luceria</placeName> was his native place. He had nearly completed 
his 57th year. His consulate, his priesthood, his high reputation, his place 
among the first men of the State, he owed, not to any energy of his own, but 
to the renown of his father. The throne was offered him by men who did not 
know him. Seldom have the affections of the army attached themselves to any 
man who sought to gain them by his virtues as firmly as they did to him from 
the indolence of his character. Yet he had a certain frankness and 
generosity, qualities indeed which turn to a man's ruin, unless tempered 
with discretion. Believing that friendship may be retained by munificent 
gifts rather than by consistency of character, he deserved more of it than 
he secured. Doubtless it was good for the State that Vitellius should be 
overthrown, but they who betrayed Vitellius to Vespasian cannot make a merit 
of their treachery, since they had themselves revolted from Galba. The day 
was now fast drawing to a close, and the Senate could not be convened, owing 
to the panic of the magistrates and Senators, who had stolen

out 
of the city, or were concealing themselves in the houses of dependants. When 
nothing more was to be feared from the enemy, Domitian came forward to meet 
the leaders of the party; he was universally saluted by the title of 
C&aelig;sar, and the troops, in great numbers, armed as they were, conducted 
him to his father's house.</p></div2></div1>

IV</head>
<head>JANUARY&mdash;NOVEMBER, A.D. <date value="70">70</date></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>WHEN Vitellius was dead, the war had indeed come to an end, but 
peace had yet to begin. Sword in hand, throughout the capital, the 
conquerors hunted down the conquered with merciless hatred. The streets were 
choked with carnage, the squares and temples reeked with blood, for men were 
massacred everywhere as chance threw them in the way. Soon, as their license 
increased, they began to search for and drag forth hidden foes. Whenever 
they saw a man tall and young they cut him down, making no distinction 
between soldiers and civilians. But the ferocity, which in the first impulse 
of hatred could be gratified only by blood, soon passed into the greed of 
gain. They let nothing be kept secret, nothing be closed; Vitellianists, 
they pretended, might be thus concealed. Here was the first step to breaking 
open private houses; here, if resistance were made, a pretext for slaughter. 
The most needy of the populace and the most worthless of the slaves did not 
fail to come forward and betray their wealthy masters; others were denounced 
by friends. Everywhere were lamentations, and wailings, and all the miseries 
of a captured city, till the license of the Vitellianist and Othonianist 
soldiery, once so odious, was remembered with regret. The leaders of the 
party, so energetic in kindling civil strife, were incapable of checking the 
abuse of victory. In stirring up tumult and strife the worst men can do the 
most, but peace and quiet cannot be established without virtue.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>Domitian had entered into possession of the 
title and residence of C&aelig;sar, but not yet applying himself to 
business, was playing the part of a son of the throne with debauchery and 
intrigue. The office of prefect of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard was held by 
Arrius Varus, but the supreme power was in the

hands of Primus 
Antonius, who carried off money and slaves from the establishment of the 
Emperor, as if they were the spoils of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>. The 
other generals, whose moderation or insignificance had shut them out from 
distinction in the war, had accordingly no share in its prizes. The country, 
terror-stricken and ready to acquiesce in servitude, urgently demanded that 
Lucius Vitellius with his cohorts should be intercepted on his way from <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>, and that the last sparks of war should be 
trodden out. The cavalry were sent on to <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>, the 
main body of the legions halted on this side of <placeName>Bovill&aelig;</placeName>. Without hesitation Vitellius surrendered 
himself and his cohorts to the discretion of the conqueror, and the soldiers 
threw down their ill-starred arms in rage quite as much as in alarm. The 
long train of prisoners, closely guarded by armed men, passed through the 
capital. Not one of them wore the look of a suppliant; sullen and savage, 
they were unmoved by the shouts and jests of the insulting rabble. A few, 
who ventured to break away, were overpowered by the force that hemmed them 
in; the rest were thrown into prison. Not one of them uttered an unworthy 
word; even in disaster the honour of the soldier was preserved. After this 
Lucius Vitellius was executed. Equally vicious with his brother, he had yet 
shewn greater vigilance during that brother's reign, and may be said, not so 
much to have shared his elevation, as to have been dragged down by his 
fall.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>About the same time Lucilius 
 Bassus was sent with some light cavalry to establish order in <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, where the towns were still disturbed, but by 
mutual animosities rather than by any spirit of opposition to the new 
Emperor. The sight of the soldiery restored quiet, and the smaller colonies 
escaped unpunished. At <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>, however, the third 
legion was stationed to pass the winter, and the noble families suffered 
severely. <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>, on the other hand, received no 
relief; so much more inclined are we to requite an injury than an 
obligation. Gratitude is a burden, while there seems to be a profit in 
revenge. They were consoled by seeing the slave of Verginius Capito, whom I 
have mentioned as the betrayer of <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>, 
gibbeted in the very rings of knighthood, the gift of Vitellius, which they 
had seen him wear.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">IMPERIAL HONORS FOR 
VESPASIAN</note>
At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the Senate, delighted and 
full of confident hope, decreed to Vespasian all the honours customarily 
bestowed on the Emperors. And indeed the civil war, which, beginning in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and afterwards 
 drawing into the struggle first <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and then <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, had traversed <placeName key="tgn,7016833">&AElig;gypt</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>, and 
<placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, every province, and every army, this war, now 
that the whole earth was, as it were, purged from guilt, seemed to have 
reached its close. Their alacrity was increased by a letter from Vespasian, 
written during the continuance of the war. Such indeed was its character at 
first sight; the writer, however, expressed himself as an Emperor, speaking 
modestly about himself, in admirable language about the State. There was no 
want of deference on the part of the Senate. On the Emperor and his son 
<persName>Titus</persName> the consulship was bestowed by decree; on Domitian the office of 
pr&aelig;tor with consular authority.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>Mucianus had also forwarded to the Senate certain letters which furnished 
matter for talk. It was said, "Why, if he is a private citizen, does he 
speak like a public man? In a few days' time he might have said the very 
same words in his place as a Senator. And even the invective against 
Vitellius comes too late, and is ungenerous; while certainly it is arrogance 
to the State and an insult to the Emperor to boast that he had the Imperial 
power in his hands, and made a present of it to Vespasian." Their dislike, 
however, was concealed; their adulation was open enough. In most flattering 
language they voted a triumph to Mucianus, a triumph for a civil war, though 
the expedition against the Sarmat&aelig; was the pretext. On Antonius Primus 
were bestowed the insignia of consular rank, on Arrius Varus and Cornelius 
Fuscus pr&aelig;torian honours. Then they remembered the Gods. It was 
determined that the Capitol should be restored. All these motions Valerius 
Asiaticus, consul elect, proposed. Most of the Senators signified their 
assent by their looks, or by raising the hand; but a few, who either held a 
distinguished rank, or had a practised talent for flattery, declared their 
acquiescence in studied speeches. When it came to the turn of Helvidius 
Priscus, pr&aelig;tor elect, to vote, he delivered an opinion, full of 
respect indeed to a worthy Emperor, and yet wholly free from insincerity; 
and he was strongly sup-

ported by the sympathies of the Senate. 
To Priscus indeed this day was in an especial manner the beginning of a 
great quarrel and a great renown.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>As I 
have again happened to mention a man of whom I shall often have to speak, 
the subject seems to demand that I should give a brief account of his life 
and pursuits, and of his fortunes. Helvidius Priscus was a native of the 
town of <placeName>Carecina</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, 
and was the son of one Cluvius, who had been a centurion of the first rank. 
In early youth he devoted his distinguished talents to the loftiest 
pursuits, not wishing, as do many, to cloak under an imposing name a life of 
indolence, but to be able to enter upon public life with a spirit fortified 
against the chances of fortune. He followed those teachers of philosophy who 
hold nothing to be good but what is honourable, nothing evil but what is 
base, and who refuse to count either among things good or evil, power, rank, 
or indeed any thing not belonging to the mind. While still holding the 
qu&aelig;storship, he was selected by P&aelig;tus Thrasea to be his 
son-in-law, and from the example of his father-in-law imbibed with peculiar 
eagerness a love of liberty. As a citizen and as a Senator, as a husband, as 
a son-in-law, as a friend, and in all the relations of life, he was ever the 
same, despising wealth, steadily tenacious of right, and undaunted by 
danger.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>There were some who thought him 
too eager for fame, and indeed the desire of glory is the last infirmity 
cast off even by the wise. The fall of his father-in-law drove him into 
exile, but he returned when Galba mounted the throne, and proceeded to 
impeach Marcellus Eprius, who had been the informer against Thrasea. This 
retribution, as great as it was just, had divided the Senate into two 
parties; for, if <persName>Marcellus</persName> fell, a whole army of fellow culprits was struck 
down. At first there was a fierce struggle, as is proved by the great 
speeches delivered by both men. But afterwards, as the feelings of Galba 
were doubtful, and many Senators interceded, Priscus dropped the charge, 
amidst comments varying with the tempers of men, some praising his 
moderation, and others deploring a lack of courage. On the day, however, 
that the Senate was voting about the Imperial dignities of Vespasian, it had 
been resolved that envoys should

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A STOIC UNDER 
THE EMPIRE</note>
be sent to the new Emperor. Hence arose a sharp 
altercation between Helvidius and Eprius. Priscus proposed that they should 
be chosen by name by the magistrates on oath, <persName>Marcellus</persName> demanded the ballot; 
and this had been the opinion expressed by the Consul elect.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>It was the dread of personal humiliation that made 
<persName>Marcellus</persName> so earnest, for he feared that, if others were chosen, he should 
himself appear slighted. From an angry conversation they passed by degrees 
to long and bitter speeches. Helvidius asked, "Why should <persName>Marcellus</persName> be so 
afraid of the judgment of the magistrates? He has wealth and eloquence, 
which might make him superior to many, were he not oppressed by the 
consciousness of guilt. The chances of the ballot do not discriminate men's 
characters; the voting and the judgment of the Senate were devised to reach 
the lives and reputations of individuals. It concerns the interests of the 
Commonwealth, it concerns the honour due to Vespasian, that he should be met 
by those whom the Senate counts to be peculiarly blameless, and who may fill 
the Emperor's ear with honourable counsels. Vespasian was the friend of 
Thrasea, Soranus, and Sextius; and the accusers of these men, though it may 
not be expedient to punish them, ought not to be paraded before him. By this 
selection on the part of the Senate the Emperor will, so to speak, be 
advised whom he should mark with approval, and from whom he should shrink. 
There can be no more effectual instrument of good government than good 
friends. Let Marcellus be satisfied with having urged <persName>Nero</persName> to destroy so 
many innocent victims; let him enjoy the wages of his crimes and his 
impunity, but let him leave Vespasian to worthier advisers."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p><persName>Marcellus</persName> declared, "It is not my opinion that is 
assailed; the Consul elect has made a motion in accordance with old 
precedents, which directed the use of the ballot in the appointment of 
envoys, in order that there might be no room for intrigue or private 
animosities. Nothing has happened why customs of long standing should fall 
into disuse, or why the honour due to the Emperor should be turned into an 
insult to any man. All Senators are competent to pay their homage. What we 
have rather to avoid is this, that

a mind unsettled by the 
novelty of power, and which will keenly watch the very looks and language of 
all, should be irritated by the obstinacy of certain persons. I do not 
forget the times in which I have been born, or the form of government which 
our fathers and grandfathers established. I may regard with admiration an 
earlier period, but I acquiesce in the present, and, while I pray for good 
Emperors, I can endure whomsoever we may have. It was not through my speech 
any more than it was through the judgment of the Senate that Thrasea fell. 
The savage temper of <persName>Nero</persName> amused itself under these forms, and I found the 
friendship of such a Prince as harassing as others found their exile. 
Finally, Helvidius may rival the Catos and the Bruti of old in constancy and 
courage; I am but one of the Senate which bows to the same yoke. Besides, I 
would advise Priscus not to climb higher than the throne, or to impose his 
counsels on Vespasian, an old man, who has won the honours of a triumph, and 
has two sons grown to manhood. For as the worst Emperors love an unlimited 
despotism, so the noblest like some check on liberty." These speeches, which 
were delivered with much vehemence on both sides, were heard with much 
diversity of feeling. That party prevailed which preferred that the envoys 
should be taken by lot, as even the neutral section in the Senate exerted 
themselves to retain the old practice, while the more conspicuous members 
inclined to the same view, dreading jealousy, should the choice fall on 
themselves.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Another struggle ensued. 
The pr&aelig;tors of the Treasury (the Treasury was at this time managed by 
pr&aelig;tors) complained of the poverty of the State, and demanded a 
retrenchment of expenditure. The Consul elect, considering how great was the 
evil and how difficult the remedy, was for reserving the matter for the 
Emperor. Helvidius gave it as his opinion that measures should be taken at 
the discretion of the Senate. When the Consuls came to take the votes, 
Vulcatius Tertullinus, tribune of the people, put his veto on any resolution 
being adopted in so important a matter in the absence of the Emperor. 
Helvidius had moved that the Capitol should be restored at the public 
expense, and that Vespasian should give his aid. All the more moderate of 
the

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VENGEANCE ON INFORMERS</note>
Senators let 
this opinion pass in silence, and in time forgot it; but there were some who 
remembered it.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>Musonius Rufus then 
made a violent attack on Publius Celer, accusing him of having brought about 
the destruction of <placeName>Barea</placeName> Soranus by perjury. By this impeachment all the 
hatreds of the days of the informers seemed to be revived; but the accused 
person was so worthless and so guilty that he could not be protected. For 
indeed the memory of Soranus was held in reverence; Celer had been a 
professor of philosophy, and had then given evidence against Barea, thus 
betraying and profaning the friendship of which he claimed to be a teacher. 
The next day was fixed for the trial. But it was not of Musonius or Publius, 
it was of Priscus, of <persName>Marcellus</persName>, and his brother informers, that men were 
thinking, now that their hearts were once roused to vengeance.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>While things were in this state, while there was 
division in the Senate, resentment among the conquered, no real authority in 
the conquerors, and in the country at large no laws and no Emperor, Mucianus 
entered the capital, and at once drew all power into his own hands. The 
influence of Primus Antonius and Varus Arrius was destroyed; for the 
irritation of Mucianus against them, though not revealed in his looks, was 
but ill-concealed, and the country, keen to discover such dislikes, had 
changed its tone and transferred its homage. He alone was canvassed and 
courted, and he, surrounding himself with armed men, and bargaining for 
palaces and gardens, ceased not, what with his magnificence, his proud 
bearing, and his guards, to grasp at the power, while he waved the titles of 
Empire. The murder of Calpurnius Galerianus caused the utmost consternation. 
He was a son of Caius Piso, and had done nothing, but a noble name and his 
own youthful beauty made him the theme of common talk; and while the country 
was still unquiet and delighted in novel topics, there were persons who 
associated him with idle rumours of Imperial honours. By order of Mucianus 
he was surrounded with a guard of soldiers. Lest his execution in the 
capital should excite too much notice, they conducted him to the fortieth 
milestone from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,6006324">Appian 
Road</placeName>, and there put him to death by opening

his veins. 
Julius Priscus, who had been prefect of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard under 
Vitellius, killed himself rather out of shame than by compulsion. Alfenius 
Varus survived the disgrace of his cowardice. Asiaticus, who was only a 
freedman, expiated by the death of a slave his evil exercise of 
power.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>At this time the country was 
hearing with anything but sorrow rumours that daily gained strength of 
disasters in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. Men began to speak of 
slaughtered armies, of captured encampments, of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> 
in revolt, as if such things were not calamities. Beginning at an earlier 
period I will discuss the causes in which this war had its origin, and the 
extent of the movements which it kindled among independent and allied 
nations. </p>
 <p>The Batavians, while they dwelt on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, formed a part of the tribe of the Chatti. Driven 
out by a domestic revolution, they took possession of an uninhabited 
district on the extremity of the coast of <placeName key="1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and 
also of a neighbouring island, surrounded by the ocean in front, and by the 
river <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> in the rear and on either side. Not 
weakened by the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> or by alliance with a 
people stronger than themselves, they furnished to the Empire nothing but 
men and arms. They had had a long training in the German wars, and they had 
gained further renown in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, to which country 
their cohorts had been transferred, commanded, according to ancient custom, 
by the noblest men in the nation. They had also at home a select body of 
cavalry, who practised with special devotion the art of swimming, so that 
they could stem the stream of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> with their 
arms and horses, without breaking the order of their squadrons.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>Julius Paullus and Claudius Civilis, scions 
of the royal family, ranked very high above the rest of their nation. 
Paullus was executed by Fonteius Capito on a false charge of rebellion. 
Civilis was put in chains and sent to <persName>Nero</persName>, and though acquitted by Galba, 
again stood in peril of his life in the time of Vitellius, when the army 
clamoured for his execution. Here were causes of deep offence; hence arose 
hopes built on our disasters. Civilis, however, was naturally politic to a 
degree rarely found among barbarians. He was wont to represent himself as

openly to revolt from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he affected a friendship 
for Vespasian and a zealous attachment to his party; and indeed a letter had 
been despatched to him by Primus Antonius, in which he was directed to 
divert the reinforcements which Vitellius had called up, and to keep the 
legions where they were by the feint of an outbreak in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. The same policy was suggested by Hordeonius in 
person; he had a bias towards Vespasian, and feared for the Empire, the 
utter ruin of which would be very near, were a fresh war with so many 
thousands of armed men to burst upon <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>Civilis, who was resolved on rebellion, and 
intended, while concealing his ulterior designs, to reveal his other plans 
as occasion presented itself, set about the work of revolution in this way. 
By command of Vitellius all the Batavian youth was then being summoned to 
the conscription, a thing naturally vexatious, and which the officials made 
yet more burdensome by their rapacity and profligacy, while they selected 
aged and infirm persons, whom they might discharge for a consideration, and 
mere striplings, but of distinguished beauty (and many attain even in 
boyhood to a noble stature), whom they dragged off for infamous purposes. 
This caused indignation, and the ringleaders of the concerted rebellion 
prevailed upon the people to refuse the conscription. Civilis collected at 
one of the sacred groves, ostensibly for a banquet, the chiefs of the nation 
and the boldest spirits of the lower class. When he saw them warmed with the 
festivities of the night, he began by speaking of the renown and glory of 
their race, and then counted the wrongs and the oppressions which they 
endured, and all the other evils of slavery. "There is," he said, "no 
alliance, as once there was; we are treated as slaves. When does even a 
legate come among us, though he come only with a burdensome retinue and in 
all the haughtiness of power? We are handed over to prefects and centurions, 
and when they are glutted with our spoils and our blood, then they are 
changed, and new receptacles for plunder, new terms for spoliation, are 
discovered. Now the conscription is at hand, tearing, we

may say, 
for ever children from parents, and brothers from brothers. Never has the 
power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> been more depressed. In the winter 
quarters of the legions there is nothing but property to plunder and a few 
old men. Only dare to look up, and cease to tremble at the empty names of 
legions. For we have a vast force of horse and foot; we have the Germans our 
kinsmen; we have <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> bent on the same objects. Even 
to the Roman people this war will not be displeasing; if defeated, we shall 
still reckon it a service to Vespasian, and for success no account need be 
rendered."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>Having been listened to 
with great approval, he bound the whole assembly with barbarous rites and 
the national forms of oath. Envoys were sent to the Canninefates to urge a 
common policy. This is a tribe which inhabits part of the island, and 
closely resembles the Batavians in their origin, their language, and their 
courageous character, but is inferior in numbers. After this he sent 
messengers to tamper with the British auxiliaries and with the Batavian 
cohorts, who, as I have before related, had been sent into <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and were then stationed at <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>. Among the Canninefates there was a certain 
Brinno, a man of a certain stolid bravery and of distinguished birth. His 
father, after venturing on many acts of hostility, had scorned with impunity 
the ridiculous expedition of Caligula. His very name, the name of a family 
of rebels, made him popular. Raised aloft on a shield after the national 
fashion, and balanced on the shoulders of the bearers, he was chosen 
general. Immediately summoning to arms the Frisii, a tribe of the further 
bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, he assailed by sea the winter 
quarters of two cohorts, which was the nearest point to attack. The soldiers 
had not anticipated the assault of the enemy; even had they done so, they 
had not strength to repulse it. Thus the camp was taken and plundered. Then 
the enemy fell upon the sutlers and Roman traders, who were wandering about 
in every direction, as they would in a time of peace. At the same time they 
were on the point of destroying the forts, but the prefects of the cohorts, 
seeing that they could not hold them, set them on fire. The standards, the 
colours, and what soldiers there were, concentrated themselves in the upper 
part of the island under the command of Aquilius,

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS' SUCCESSES</note>
a centurion of the first rank, an army 
in name rather than in strength. Vitellius in fact, after withdrawing the 
effective troops from the cohorts, had loaded with arms a crowd of idlers 
from the neighbouring villages of the Nervii and the Germans.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>Civilis, thinking that he must proceed by craft, 
actually blamed the prefects for having deserted the forts, saying that he 
would himself, with the cohort under his command, quell the disturbance 
among the Canninefates, and that they had better return to their respective 
winter quarters. In was evident, however, that there was some treacherous 
design beneath this advice, that the cohorts would be dispersed only to be 
more easily crushed, and that the guiding hand in the war was not Brinno but 
Civilis; for indications of the truth, which the Germans, a people who 
delight in war, could not long conceal, were gradually coming to light. When 
stratagem proved ineffectual, he resorted to force, arranging in distinct 
columns the Canninefates, the Batavians, and the Frisii. The Roman army was 
drawn up to meet them not far from the river <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, 
and the ships, which, after burning the forts, they had stranded at that 
point, were arranged so as to front the enemy. Before the struggle had 
lasted long, a cohort of Tungrians carried over their standards to Civilis. 
The other troops, paralysed by the unexpected desertion, were cut down alike 
by friends and foes. In the fleet there was the same treachery. Some of the 
rowers were Batavians, and they hindered the operations of the sailors and 
combatants by an apparent want of skill; then they began to back water, and 
to run the sterns on to the hostile shore. At last they killed the pilots 
and centurions, unless these were willing to join them. The end was that the 
whole fleet of four and twenty vessels either deserted or was taken.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>For the moment this was a brilliant success, 
and it had its use for the future. They possessed themselves of some arms 
and some vessels, both of which they wanted, while they became very famous 
throughout <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> as the champions of liberty. The 
tribes of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> immediately sent envoys with 
offers of troops. The co-operation of <placeName key="1000070">Gaul</placeName> Civilis 
endeavoured to secure by politic liberality, sending

back to 
their respective states the captured prefects of cohorts, and giving 
permission to their men to go or stay as they preferred. He offered to those 
who stayed service on honourable terms, to those who departed the spoils of 
the Roman army. At the same time he reminded them in confidential 
conversations of the wrongs which they had endured for so many years, while 
they falsely gave to a wretched slavery the name of peace. "The Batavians," 
he said, "though free of tribute, have yet taken up arms against our common 
masters. In the first conflict the soldiers of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> 
have been routed and vanquished. What will be the result if <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> throws off the yoke? What strength is there yet 
left in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>? It is by the blood of the provinces 
that the provinces are conquered. Think not of how it fared with the armies 
of <persName>Vindex</persName>. It was by Batavian cavalry that the &AElig;dui and the Arverni 
were trampled down, and among the auxiliaries of Verginius there were found 
Belgian troops. To those who will estimate the matter aright it is evident 
that <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> fell by her own strength. But now all are 
on the same side, and we have whatever remnant of military vigour still 
flourished in the camps of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. With us too are the 
 veteran cohorts to which the legions of <persName>Otho</persName> lately succumbed. Let <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName>, and the East, 
habituated as it is to despotism, submit to slavery; there are many yet 
alive in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> who were born before the days of 
tribute. It was only lately indeed that Quintilius Varus was slain, and 
slavery driven out of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. And the Emperor who 
was challenged by that war was not a Vitellius, but a C&aelig;sar Augustus. 
Freedom is a gift bestowed by nature even on the dumb animals. Courage is 
the peculiar excellence of man, and the Gods help the braver side. Let us 
then, who are free to act and vigorous, fall on a distracted and exhausted 
enemy. While some are supporting Vespasian, and others Vitellius, 
opportunities are opening up for acting against both."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>Civilis, bent on winning <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> if his purposes 
should prosper, was on the point of securing supremacy over the most 
powerful and most wealthy of the states. His first attempts Hordeonius 
Flaccus had encouraged by affecting ignorance. But when messengers came 
hurrying in with intelligence that a camp had been stormed, that cohorts

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">SEEKS COOPERATION OF <placeName key="tgn,1000070">GAUL</placeName></note>
had been cut to pieces, and that the Roman 
power had been expelled from the island of the Batavians, the general 
ordered the legate, Munius Lupercus, who was in command of the winter 
quarters of two legions, to advance against the enemy. Lupercus in great 
haste threw across the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> such legionaries as 
were on the spot, some Ubian troops who were close at hand, and some cavalry 
of the Treveri, who were stationed at no great distance; these were 
accompanied by some Batavian horse, who, though they had been long 
disaffected, yet still simulated loyalty in order that by betraying the 
Romans in the moment of actual conflict they might receive a higher price 
for their desertion. Civilis, surrounding himself with the standards of the 
captured cohorts, to keep their recent honours before the eyes of his own 
men, and to terrify the enemy by the remembrance of defeat, now directed his 
own mother and sisters, and the wives and children of all his men, to stand 
in the rear, where they might encourage to victory, or shame defeat. The 
war-song of the men, and the shrill cries of the women, rose from the whole 
line, and an answering but far less vigorous cheer came from the legions and 
auxiliaries. The Batavians had exposed the left wing by their desertion, and 
they immediately turned against our men. Still the legionaries, though their 
position was alarming, kept their arms and their ranks. The auxiliaries of 
the Ubii and the Treveri broke at once in shameful flight, and dispersed 
over the whole country. On that side the Germans threw the weight of their 
attack. Meanwhile the legions had an opportunity of retreating into what was 
called the Old Camp. Claudius Labeo, prefect of the Batavian horse, who had 
been the rival of Civilis in some local contest, was sent away into the 
country of the Frisii; to kill him might be to give offence to his 
countrymen, while to keep him with the army might be to sow the seeds of 
discord.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>About the same time the 
messenger despatched by Civilis came up with the cohorts of the Batavians 
and the Canninefates, while by the orders of Vitellius they were advancing 
towards <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. At once, inflated with pride and 
haughtiness, they demanded, by way of remuneration for their march, a 
donative, double pay, and an increase in the

number of cavalry, 
things indeed which Vitellius had promised, but which they now asked, not 
with the thought of obtaining them, but as a pretext for mutiny. Flaccus, by 
his many concessions, had produced no other effect but to make them insist 
with more energy on what they knew he must refuse. Treating him with 
contempt, they made their way towards <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Lower Germany</placeName>, 
to join Civilis. Hordeonius, assembling the tribunes and centurions, asked 
their opinion as to whether he should use coercion with those who refused 
obedience. Soon, yielding to his natural timidity and to the alarm of his 
officers, who were troubled by the suspicious temper of the auxiliaries and 
by the fact that the ranks of the legions had been recruited by a hurried 
conscription, he resolved to confine his troops to the camp. Then, repenting 
of his resolve, and finding that the very men who had advised it now 
disapproved it, he seemed bent on pursuing the enemy, and wrote to Herennius 
Gallus, legate of the first legion, who was then holding <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName>, that he was to prevent the Batavians from 
 crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, and that he would himself hang 
on their rear with his army. They might have been crushed, if Hordeonius, 
moving from one side, and Gallus from the other, had enclosed them between 
their armies. But Flaccus abandoned his purpose, and, in other despatches to 
Gallus, recommended him not to threaten the departing foe. Thence arose a 
suspicion that the war was being kindled with the consent of the legates, 
and that everything which had happened, or was apprehended, was due, not to 
the cowardice of the troops, or to the strength of the enemy, but to the 
treachery of the generals.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>When the 
 Batavians were near the camp at <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName>, they sent on 
before them delegates, commissioned to deliver to Herennius Gallus a message 
from the cohorts. It was to this effect: "We have no quarrel with the 
Romans, for whom we have so often fought. Wearied with a protracted and 
fruitless service, we long for our native land and for rest. If no one 
oppose us, our march will be harmless, but if an armed force encounter us, 
we will make a way with the sword." The soldiers prevailed upon the 
hesitating legate to risk the chances of a battle. Three thousand 
legionaries, some raw Belgian cohorts, and with them a mob of rustic

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">ROMANS DEFEATED AT <placeName key="tgn,7005090">BONNA</placeName></note>
and camp-followers, cowardly, but bold of 
speech before the moment of danger, rushed out of all the gates, thinking to 
surround the Batavians, who were inferior in number. But the enemy, being 
veteran troops, formed in columns, presenting on every side a dense array, 
with front, flanks, and rear secure. Thus they were able to break the thin 
line of our soldiers. The Belgians giving way, the legion was driven back, 
retreating in confusion on the entrenchments and the gates. It was there 
that the greatest slaughter took place. The trenches were heaped up with 
corpses. Nor was it only from the deadly blows of the enemy that they 
suffered; many perished in the crush and by their own weapons. The 
victorious army, who avoided the <placeName key="tgn,7004446">Colonia 
Agrippinensis</placeName>, did not venture on any other hostile act during the 
 remainder of their march, and excused the conflict at <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName>, alleging that they had asked for peace, and that 
when it was refused they had but looked to their own safety.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>Civilis, who now on the arrival of these veteran 
cohorts was at the head of a complete army, but who was undecided in his 
plans, and still reflected on the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, 
made all who were with him swear allegiance to Vespasian, and sent envoys to 
the two legions which after their defeat in the previous engagement had 
retreated into the Old Camp, advising them to accept the same allegiance. 
Their reply was: "We do not follow the advice of traitors or enemies. 
Vitellius is our Emperor; to him we will retain our fealty and devote our 
swords till our last breath. Then let not a Batavian refugee affect to 
decide the destinies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; let him rather await 
the merited penalty of his guilt." When this reply was delivered to Civilis, 
he was furious with anger, and hurried the whole Batavian nation into open 
war. The Bructeri and the Tencteri joined him, and messengers summoned all 
<placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> to share in his plunder and his 
glory.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>To meet the threatened dangers 
of the gathering war, the legates of the legions, Munius Lupercus and 
Numisius Rufus, strengthened their entrenchments and walls. The buildings, 
which during a long period of peace had grown up like a town near the camp, 
were destroyed, lest they might be useful to the enemy. Little care, 
however, was taken

about the conveyance of supplies into the 
camp. These the generals allowed to be plundered; and so, what might long 
have sufficed for their necessities, was wantonly wasted in a few days. 
Civilis, who occupied the centre of the army with the <emph rend="italic">&eacute;lite</emph> of the Batavian troops, wishing to add a new 
 terror to his demonstration, covered both banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> with columns of his German allies, while his 
cavalry galloped about the plains. At the same time the fleet was moved up 
the stream. Here were the standards of the veteran cohorts; there the images 
of wild beasts, brought out of the woods and sacred groves, under the 
various forms which each tribe is used to follow into battle, and these 
mingled emblems of civil and of foreign warfare utterly confounded the 
besieged. The extent of the entrenchment raised the hopes of the besiegers. 
Constructed for two legions, it was now held by not more than five thousand 
Roman soldiers. But there was with them a great number of camp-followers, 
who had assembled there on the disturbance of peace, and who could be 
employed in the contest.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>Part of the 
camp occupied the gentle slope of a hill; to part was a level approach. By 
this encampment Augustus had thought the German tribes might be watched and 
checked; never had he contemplated such a pitch of disaster, as that these 
tribes should themselves advance to attack our legions. Hence no laubour was 
bestowed on the ground or on the defences. Our valour and our arms seemed 
defence enough. The Batavians and the Transrhenane tribes took up their 
position, each tribe by itself, to distinguish and so the better to display 
the valour of each; first annoying us by a distant volley; then, as they 
found that very many of their missiles fixed themselves harmlessly in the 
turrets and battlements of the walls, and they themselves suffered from the 
stones showered down on them, they fell on the entrenchment with a shout and 
furious rush, many placing their scaling-ladders against the ramparts, and 
others mounting on a testudo formed by their comrades. Some were in the act 
of climbing over when they were thrust down by the swords of the enemy, and 
fell overwhelmed by a storm of javelins and stakes. Always very daring at 
first and excessively elated by success, they now in their eagerness for

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS REPULSED AT <placeName key="tgn,7004980">XANTEN</placeName></note>
plunder bore up against reverse. They also 
ventured to use what to them was a novelty, engines of war; they had 
themselves no skill in handling them, but the prisoners and deserters taught 
them to pile up timber in the shape of a bridge, under which they put 
wheels, and so propelled it, some standing on the top, and fighting as they 
would from an earth-work, others concealing themselves within and 
undermining the walls. But the stones thrown by the catapults prostrated the 
ill-constructed fabric, and when they set themselves to prepare hurdles and 
mantlets, burning spears were thrown on them by the engines, fire being thus 
actually used against the assailants. At last, despairing of success by 
force, they changed their plans, and resolved to wait, for they were well 
aware that only a few days' provisions were in the camp, and that there was 
a great crowd of non-combatants; and they counted at the same time on the 
treachery that might follow on scarcity, on the wavering fidelity of the 
slaves, and on the chances of war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>Meanwhile Flaccus, who had heard of the siege of the camp, and had sent into 
all parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> to collect auxiliaries, put under 
command of Diilius Vocula, legate of the 18th legion, some troops picked 
from the legions with orders to hasten by forced marches along the banks of 
the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>. Flaccus himself, who was weak in health 
and disliked by his troops, travelled with the fleet. The troops indeed 
complained in unmistakeable language that their general had despatched the 
Batavian cohorts from <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>, had feigned 
ignorance of the plans of Civilis, and was inviting the German tribes to 
join the league. "This," they said, "has strengthened Vespasian no less than 
the exertions of Primus Antonius and Mucianus. Declared enmity and hostility 
may be openly repulsed, but treachery and fraud work in darkness, and so 
cannot be avoided. Civilis stands in arms against us, and arranges the order 
of his battle; Hordeonius from his chamber or his litter gives such orders 
as may best serve the enemy. The swords of thousands of brave men are 
directed by one old man's sick caprice. How much better by slaying the 
traitor, to set free our valour and our fortune from these evil auspices!" 
The passions already kindled by the language which they thus held among 
themselves were

yet more inflamed by a despatch from Vespasian, 
which Flaccus, finding that it could not be concealed, read before an 
assembly of the troops, sending the persons who had brought it in chains to 
Vitellius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>With feelings somewhat 
 appeased, they arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName>, the winter-camp of 
the first legion. The troops there were even more enraged against 
Hordeonius, and laid on him the blame of the late disaster. They said that 
it was by his orders that they had offered battle to the Batavians, 
supposing that the legions from <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName> were 
following them; that it was through his treachery that they had been 
slaughtered, no reinforcements coming up; that all these events were unknown 
to the other legions, and were not told to their Emperor, though the sudden 
outburst of treason might have been crushed by the prompt action of so many 
provinces. Hordeonius read to the army copies of all the letters which he 
had sent about <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, begging for reinforcements, and 
established as a precedent a most disgraceful practice, namely, the handing 
over the despatches to the standard-bearers of the legions, through whose 
means they were read by the soldiers sooner than by the generals. He then 
ordered one of the mutineers to be put in irons, more for the sake of 
asserting his authority than because any one man was in fault. The army was 
then moved from <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName> to the <placeName key="tgn,7004446">Colonia Agrippinensis</placeName>, while auxiliaries from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> continued to flow in; for at first that nation 
zealously supported the cause of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Soon indeed 
as the Germans increased in power, many of the states took up arms against 
us, moved by the hope of freedom and, could they once shake off the yoke, 
even by the lust of empire. The irritation of the legions still increased, 
nor had the imprisonment of a single soldier struck them with terror. This 
fellow indeed actually charged the general with complicity; he had, he said, 
acted as a messenger between Civilis and Flaccus, and because he might tell 
the truth he was now being crushed under a false charge. With wonderful 
firmness Vocula ascended the tribunal, and ordered the man, who had been 
seized by the lictors, and was loudly remonstrating, to be led off to 
execution. All the best men acquiesced in the order, while the ill-affected 
were struck with terror. Then, as all with common

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DIFFICULTIES IN ROMAN ARMY</note>
consent demanded that Vocula 
should be their general, Hordeonius handed over to him the supreme 
command.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>But there were many things 
to exasperate the already divided feelings of the soldiery. Pay and 
provisions were scanty, <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> was rebelling against 
 conscription and taxes, while the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, owing to a 
drought unexampled in that climate, would hardly admit of navigation, and 
thus supplies were straitened at the same time that outposts had to be 
established along the entire bank to keep the Germans from fording the 
stream; the self-same cause thus bringing about a smaller supply of grain 
and a greater number of consumers. Among ignorant persons the very failure 
of the stream was regarded as a prodigy, as if the very rivers, the old 
defences of the Empire, were deserting us. What, in peace, would have seemed 
chance or nature, was now spoken of as destiny and the anger of heaven. As 
the army entered <placeName>Novesium</placeName> the sixteenth legion 
joined it; Herennius Gallus, its legate, was associated with Vocula in the 
responsibilities of command. As they did not venture to advance upon the 
enemy, they constructed a camp at a place called <placeName>Gelduba</placeName>. Here the generals sought to give steadiness to 
the troops by such exercises as forming in order of battle, constructing 
fortifications, making entrenchments, and whatever else might train them for 
war. In the hope that they might be fired to courage by the delights of 
plunder, Vocula led the army against the nearest villages of the Gugerni, 
who had accepted the alliance of Civilis. Some of the troops remained 
permanently with Herennius Gallus.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>One day it happened that at no great distance from the camp the Germans were 
endeavouring to drag off to their own bank a vessel laden with corn, which 
had run aground in the shallows. Gallus could not endure this, and sent a 
cohort to help. The numbers of the Germans also increased; as fresh troops 
continued to join both sides, a regular battle ensued. The Germans, besides 
inflicting great loss on our men, carried off the vessel. The vanquished 
troops, following what had become a regular practice, laid the blame not on 
their own cowardice, but on supposed treachery in the legate. Dragged out of 
his tent, his garments torn, and his person severely beaten, he was 
commanded to declare for what

bribe and with what accomplices he 
had betrayed the army. Their old hatred of Hordeonius reappeared. He, they 
declared, was the instigator of the crime, Gallus his tool. At last, utterly 
terrified by their threats of instant death, the legate himself charged 
Hordeonius with treachery. He was then put in irons, and only released on 
the arrival of Vocula, who the next day inflicted capital punishment on the 
ringleaders of the mutiny; such wide extremes of license and of 
subordination were to be found in that army. The common soldiers were 
undoubtedly loyal to Vitellius, but all the most distinguished men were in 
favour of Vespasian. The result was an alternation of outbreaks and 
executions, and a strange mixture of obedience and frenzy, which made it 
impossible to restrain the men whom it was yet possible to punish.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="28"><p>Meanwhile all <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> was raising the power of Civilis by vast 
additions of strength, and the alliance was secured by hostages of the 
noblest rank. He directed that the territories of the Ubii and the Treveri 
should be ravaged by the several tribes on which they bordered, and that 
another detachment should cross the river Mosa, to 
threaten the Menapii and the Morini and the frontiers of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. In both quarters plunder was collected; with 
peculiar hostility in the case of the Ubii, because this nation, being of 
German origin, had forsworn its native country, and assumed the Roman name 
of the Agrippinenses. Their cohorts were cut up at the village of <placeName>Marcodurum</placeName>, where they lay in careless security, 
presuming on their distance from the river-bank. The Ubii did not remain 
quiet, but made predatory excursions into <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, 
escaping at first with impunity, though they were afterwards cut off. 
Throughout the whole of this war, they were more loyal than fortunate. 
Civilis, grown more formidable now that the Ubii had been crushed, and 
elated by the success of his operations, pressed on the siege of the 
legions, keeping a strict watch to prevent any secret intelligence of 
advancing succours from reaching them. He entrusted to the Batavians the 
care of the machines and the vast siege works, and when the Transrhenane 
tribes clamoured for battle, he bade them go and cut through the ramparts, 
and, if repulsed, renew the struggle; their numbers

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS ASSAULTS ROMAN CAMP</note>
were superfluously large, and 
their loss was not felt. Even darkness did not terminate the 
struggle.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>Piling up logs of wood 
round the walls and lighting them, they sat feasting, and rushed to the 
conflict, as each grew heated with wine, with a useless daring. Their 
missiles were discharged without effect in the darkness, but to the Romans 
the ranks of the barbarians were plainly discernible, and they singled out 
with deliberate aim anyone whose boldness or whose decorations made him 
conspicuous. Civilis saw this, and, extinguishing the fires, threw the 
confusion of darkness over the attack. Then ensued a scene of discordant 
clamour, of accident, and uncertainty, where no one could see how to aim or 
to avoid a blow. Wherever a shout was heard, they wheeled round and strained 
hand and foot. Valour was of no avail, accident disturbed every plan, and 
the bravest frequently were struck down by the missiles of the coward. The 
Germans fought with inconsiderate fury; our men, more alive to the danger, 
threw, but not at random, stakes shod with iron and heavy stones. Where the 
noise of the assailants was heard, or where the ladders placed against the 
walls brought the enemy within reach of their hands, they pushed them back 
with their shields, and followed them with their javelins. Many, who had 
struggled on to the walls, they stabbed with their short swords. After a 
night thus spent, day revealed a new method of attack.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="30"><p>The Batavians had raised a tower two stories high, 
which they brought up to the Pr&aelig;torian gate of the camp, where the 
ground was most level. But our men, pushing forward strong poles, and 
battering it with beams, broke it down, causing great destruction among the 
combatants on the top. The enemy were attacked in their confusion by a 
sudden and successful sally. All this time many engines were constructed by 
the legionaries, who were superior to the enemy in experience and skill. 
Peculiar consternation was caused by a machine, which, being poised in the 
air over the heads of the enemy, suddenly descended, and carried up one or 
more of them past the faces of their friends, and then, by a shifting of the 
weights, projected them within the limits of the camp. Civilis, giving up 
all hope of a successful assault, again sat down to blockade the camp at his 
leisure

and undermined the fidelity of the legions by the 
promises of his emissaries.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="31"><p>All these 
events in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> took place before the battle of 
<placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, the result of which was announced in a 
despatch from Antonius, accompanied by C&aelig;cina's proclamation. Alpinius 
Montanus, prefect of a cohort in the vanquished army, was on the spot, and 
acknowledged the fate of his party. Various were the emotions thus excited; 
the Gallic auxiliaries, who felt neither affection nor hatred towards either 
party, and who served without attachment, at once, at the instance of their 
prefects, deserted Vitellius. The veteran soldiers hesitated. Nevertheless, 
when Hordeonius administered the oath, under a strong pressure from their 
tribunes, they pronounced the words, which their looks and their temper 
belied, and, while they adopted every other expression, they hesitated at 
the name of Vespasian, passing it over with a slight murmur, and not 
unfrequently in absolute silence.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="32"><p>After this, certain letters from Antonius to Civilis were read in full 
assembly, and provoked the suspicions of the soldiery, as they seemed to be 
addressed to a partisan of the cause and to be unfriendly to the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. Soon the news reached the camp at <placeName key="tgn,7005980">Gelduba</placeName>, and the same language and the same acts were 
repeated. Montanus was sent with a message to Civilis, bidding him desist 
from hostilities, and not seek to conceal the designs of an enemy by 
fighting under false colours, and telling him that, if he had been 
attempting to assist Vespasian, his purpose had been fully accomplished. 
Civilis at first replied in artful language, but soon perceiving that 
Montanus was a man of singularly high spirit and was himself disposed for 
change, he began with lamenting the perils through which he had struggled 
for five-and-twenty years in the camps of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. "It 
is," he said, "a noble reward that I have received for my toils; my brother 
murdered, myself imprisoned, and the savage clamour of this army, a clamour 
which demanded my execution, and for which by the law of nations I demand 
vengeance. You, Treveri, and other enslaved creatures, what reward do you 
expect for the blood which you have shed so often? What but a hateful 
service, perpetual tribute, the

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS 
PERSISTS</note>
rod, the axe, and the passions of a ruling race? See how I, 
the prefect of a single cohort, with the Batavians and the Canninefates, a 
mere fraction of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, have destroyed their vast but 
useless camps, or are pressing them with the close blockade of famine and 
the sword. In a word, either freedom will follow on our efforts, or, if we 
are vanquished, we shall but be what we were before." Having thus fired the 
man's ambition, Civilis dismissed him, but bade him carry back a milder 
answer. He returned, pretending to have failed in his mission, but not 
revealing the other facts; these indeed soon came to light.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="33"><p>Civilis, retaining a part of his forces, sent the 
veteran cohorts and the bravest of his German troops against Vocula and his 
army, under the command of Julius Maximus and Claudius Victor, his sister's 
son. On their march they plundered the winter camp of a body of horse 
stationed at <placeName>Ascibergium</placeName>, and they fell on Vocula's 
camp so unexpectedly that he could neither harangue his army, nor even get 
it into line. All that he could do in the confusion was to order the veteran 
troops to strengthen the centre. The auxiliaries were dispersed in every 
part of the field. The cavalry charged, but, received by the orderly array 
of the enemy, fled to their own lines. What ensued was a massacre rather 
than a battle. The Nervian infantry, from panic or from treachery, exposed 
the flank of our army. Thus the attack fell upon the legions, who had lost 
their standards and were being cut down within the entrenchments, when the 
fortune of the day was suddenly changed by a reinforcement of fresh troops. 
Some Vascon infantry, levied by Galba, which had by this time been sent for, 
heard the noise of the combatants as they approached the camp, attacked the 
rear of the preoccupied enemy, and spread a panic more than proportionate to 
their numbers, some believing that all the troops from <placeName>Novesium</placeName>, others that all from <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>, had come up. This delusion restored the 
courage of the Romans, and in relying on the strength of others they 
recovered their own. All the bravest of the Batavians, of the infantry at 
least, fell, but the cavalry escaped with the standards and with the 
prisoners whom they had secured in the early part of the engagement. Of the 
slain on that day the greater number be-

longed to our army, but 
to its less effective part. The Germans lost the flower of their 
force.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="34"><p>The two generals were equally 
blameworthy; they deserved defeat, they did not make the most of success. 
Had Civilis given battle in greater force, he could not have been outflanked 
by so small a number of cohorts, and he might have destroyed the camp after 
once forcing an entrance. As for Vocula, he did not reconnoitre the 
advancing enemy, and consequently he was vanquished as soon as he left the 
camp; and then, mistrusting his victory, he fruitlessly wasted several days 
before marching against the enemy, though, had he at once resolved to drive 
them back, and to follow up his success, he might, by one and the same 
movement, have raised the siege of the legions. Meanwhile Civilis had tried 
to work on the feelings of the besieged by representing that with the Romans 
all was lost, and that victory had declared for his own troops. The 
standards and colours were carried round the ramparts, and the prisoners 
also were displayed. One of them, with noble daring, declared the real truth 
in a loud voice, and, as he was cut down on the spot by the Germans, all the 
more confidence was felt in his information. At the same time it was 
becoming evident, from the devastation of the country and from the flames of 
burning houses, that the victorious army was approaching. Vocula issued 
orders that the standards should be planted within sight of the camp, and 
should be surrounded with a ditch and rampart, where his men might deposit 
their knapsacks, and so fight without encumbrance. On this, the General was 
assailed by a clamorous demand for instant battle. They had now grown used 
to threaten. Without even taking time to form into line, disordered and 
weary as they were, they commenced the action. Civilis was on the field, 
trusting quite as much to the faults of his adversaries as to the valour of 
his own troops. With the Romans the fortune of the day varied, and the most 
violently mutinous shewed themselves cowards. But some, remembering their 
recent victory, stood their ground and struck fiercely at the foe, now 
encouraging each other and their neighbours, and now, while they re-formed 
their lines, imploring the besieged not to lose the opportunity. These 
latter, who saw everything from the walls, sallied

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS DEFEATED, HARASSES ROMANS</note>
out from every gate. It 
so happened that Civilis was thrown to the ground by the fall of his horse. 
A report that he had been either wounded or slain gained belief throughout 
both armies, and spread incredible panic among his own troops, and gave as 
great encouragement to their opponents. But Vocula, leaving the flying foe, 
began to strengthen the rampart and the towers of the camp, as if another 
siege were imminent. He had misused success so often that he was rightly 
suspected of a preference for war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="35"><p>Nothing distressed our troops so much as the scarcity of supplies. The 
baggage of the legions was therefore sent to <placeName>Novesium</placeName> with a crowd of non-combatants to fetch corn 
from that place overland, for the enemy commanded the river. The march of 
the first body was accomplished in security, as Civilis had not yet 
recovered. But when he heard that officers of the commissariat had been 
again sent to <placeName>Novesium</placeName>, and that the infantry 
detached as an escort were advancing just as if it was a time of profound 
peace, with but few soldiers round the standards, the arms stowed away in 
the wagons, and all wandering about at their pleasure, he attacked them in 
regular form, having first sent on troops to occupy the bridges and the 
defiles in the road. The battle extended over a long line of march, lasting 
with varying success till night parted the combatants. The infantry pushed 
on to <placeName key="tgn,7005980">Gelduba</placeName>, while the camp remained in the same 
state as before, garrisoned by such troops as had been left in it. There 
could be no doubt what peril a convoy, heavily laden and panic stricken, 
would have to encounter in attempting to return. Vocula added to his force a 
thousand picked men from the fifth and fifteenth legions besieged in the Old 
Camp, a body of troops undisciplined and ill-affected to their officers. But 
more than the number specified came forward, and openly protested, as they 
marched, that they would not endure any longer the hardships of famine and 
the treachery of the legates. On the other hand, those who had stayed behind 
complained that they were being left to their fate by this withdrawal of a 
part of the legions. A twofold mutiny was the result, some calling upon 
Vocula to come back, while the others refused to return to the camp.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="36"><p>Meanwhile Civilis blockaded the Old Camp. 
Vocula

 retired first to <placeName key="tgn,7005980">Gelduba</placeName>, 
afterwards to <placeName>Novesium</placeName>; Civilis took possession of 
 <placeName key="tgn,7005980">Gelduba</placeName>, and not long after was victorious in a 
cavalry engagement near <placeName>Novesium</placeName>. But reverses and 
successes seemed equally to kindle in the troops the one desire of murdering 
their officers. The legions, increased in number by the arrival of the men 
from the fifth and fifteenth, demanded a donative, for they had discovered 
that some money had been sent by Vitellius. After a short delay Hordeonius 
gave the donative in the name of Vespasian. This, more than anything else, 
fostered the mutinous spirit. The men, abandoning themselves to debauchery 
and revelry and all the license of nightly gatherings, revived their old 
grudge against Hordeonius. Without a single legate or tribune venturing to 
check them, for the darkness seems to have taken from them all sense of 
shame, they dragged him out of his bed and killed him. The same fate was 
intended for Vocula, but he assumed the dress of a slave, and escaped 
unrecognized in the darkness. When their fury had subsided and their alarm 
returned, they sent centurions with despatches to the various states of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, imploring help in money and troops.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="37"><p>These men, headstrong, cowardly, and spiritless, as 
a mob without a leader always is, on the approach of Civilis hastily took up 
arms, and, as hastily abandoning them, betook themselves to flight. Disaster 
produced disunion, the troops from the Upper army dissociating their cause 
from that of their comrades. Nevertheless the statues of Vitellius were 
again set up in the camp and in the neighbouring Belgian towns, and this at 
a time when Vitellius himself had fallen. Then the men of the 1st, the 4th, 
and the 18th legions, repenting of their conduct, followed Vocula, and again 
taking in his presence the oath of allegiance to Vespasian, were marched by 
him to the relief of <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>. The besieging 
army, an heterogeneous mass of Chatti, Usipii and Mattiaci, had raised the 
siege, glutted with spoils, but not without suffering loss. Our troops 
attacked them on the way, dispersed and unprepared. Moreover the Treveri had 
constructed a breastwork and rampart across their territory and they and the 
Germans continued to contend with great losses on both sides up to the time 
when they tarnished by

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS ATTACKS MUTINOUS 
ROMANS</note>
rebellion their distinguished services to the Roman 
people.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="38"><p>Meanwhile Vespasian (now 
consul for the second time) and Titus entered upon their office, both being 
absent from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. People were gloomy and anxious 
under the pressure of manifold fears, for, over and above immediate perils, 
they had taken groundless alarm under the impression that <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> was in rebellion through the revolutionary 
movements of Lucius Piso. He was governor of that province, and was far from 
being a man of turbulent disposition. The fact was that the wheat-ships were 
detained by the severity of the weather, and the lower orders, who were 
accustomed to buy their provisions from day to day, and to whom cheap corn 
was the sole subject of public interest, feared and believed that the ports 
had been closed and the supplies stopped, the Vitellianists, who had not yet 
given up their party feelings, helping to spread the report, which was not 
displeasing even to the conquerors. Their ambition, which even foreign 
campaigns could not fill to the full, was not satisfied by any triumphs that 
civil war could furnish.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="39"><p>On the 1st 
of January, at a meeting of the Senate, convoked for the purpose by Julius 
Frontinus, pr&aelig;tor of the city, votes of thanks were passed to the 
legates, to the armies, and to the allied kings. The office of pr&aelig;tor 
was taken away from Tettius Julianus, as having deserted his legion when it 
passed over to the party of Vespasian, with a view to its being transferred 
to Plotius Griphus. Equestrian rank was conferred on Hormus. Then, on the 
resignation of Frontinus, C&aelig;sar Domitian assumed the office of 
pr&aelig;tor of the city. His name was put at the head of despatches and 
edicts, but the real authority was in the hands of Mucianus, with this 
exception, that Domitian ventured on several acts of power, at the 
instigation of his friends, or at his own caprice. But Mucianus found his 
principal cause of apprehension in Primus Antonius and Varus Arrius, who, in 
the freshness of their fame, while distinguished by great achievements and 
by the attachment of the soldiery, were also supported by the people, 
because in no case had they extended their severities beyond the 
battle-field. It was also reported that Antonius had urged Scribonianus 
Crassus, whom an illustrious descent added to the honours of his brother 
made a

conspicuous person, to assume the supreme power; and it 
was understood that a number of accomplices would not have failed to support 
him, had not the proposal been rejected by Scribonianus, who was a man not 
easily to be tempted even by a certainty, and was proportionately 
apprehensive of risk. Mucianus, seeing that Antonius could not be openly 
crushed, heaped many praises upon him in the Senate, and loaded him with 
promises in secret, holding out as a prize the government of Eastern <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, then vacant in consequence of the departure of 
Cluvius Rufus. At the same time he lavished on his friends tribuneships and 
prefectures; and then, when he had filled the vain heart of the man with 
hope and ambition, he destroyed his power by sending into winter quarters 
the 7th legion, whose affection for Antonius was particularly vehement. The 
3rd legion, old troops of Varus Arrius, were sent back to <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. Part of the army was on its way to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. Thus all elements of disturbance being removed, 
the usual appearance of the capital, the laws, and the jurisdiction of the 
magistrates, were once more restored.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="40"><p>Domitian, on the day of his taking his seat in the Senate, made a brief and 
measured speech in reference to the absence of his father and brother, and 
to his own youth. He was graceful in his bearing, and, his real character 
being yet unknown, the frequent blush on his countenance passed for modesty. 
On his proposing the restoration of the Imperial honours of Galba, Curtius 
Montanus moved that respect should also be paid to the memory of Piso. The 
Senate passed both motions, but that which referred to Piso was not carried 
out. Certain commissioners were then appointed by lot, who were to see to 
the restitution of property plundered during the war, to examine and restore 
to their place the brazen tables of the laws, which had fallen down through 
age, to free the Calendar from the additions with which the adulatory spirit 
of the time had disfigured it, and to put a check on the public expenditure. 
The office of pr&aelig;tor was restored to Tettius Julianus, as soon as it 
was known that he had fled for refuge to Vespasian. Griphus still retained 
his rank. It was then determined that the cause of Musonius Rufus against 
Publius Celer should be again brought on.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DOMITIAN IN SENATE</note>
Publius was condemned, and thus 
expiation was made to the shade of Soranus. The day thus marked by an 
example of public justice was not barren of distinction to individuals. 
Musonius was thought to have fulfilled the righteous duty of an accuser, but 
men spoke very differently of Demetrius, a disciple of the Cynical school of 
philosophy, who pleaded the cause of a notorious criminal by appeals to 
corrupt influences rather than by fair argument. Publius himself, in his 
peril, had neither spirit nor power of speech left. The signal for vengeance 
on the informers having been thus given, Junius Mauricus asked C&aelig;sar 
to give the Senate access to the Imperial registers, from which they might 
learn what impeachments the several informers had proposed. C&aelig;sar 
answered, that in a matter of such importance the Emperor must be 
consulted.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="41"><p>The Senate, led by its 
principal members, then framed a form of oath, which was eagerly taken by 
all the magistrates and by the other Senators in the order in which they 
voted. They called the Gods to witness, that nothing had been done by their 
instrumentality to prejudice the safety of any person, and that they had 
gained no distinction or advantage by the ruin of Roman citizens. Great was 
the alarm, and various the devices for altering the words of the oath, among 
those who felt the consciousness of guilt. The Senate appreciated the 
scruple, but denounced the perjury. This public censure, as it might be 
called, fell with especial severity on three men, Sariolenus Vocula, Nonnius 
Attianus, and Cestius Severus, all of them infamous for having practised the 
trade of the informer in the days of Nero. Sariolenus indeed laboured under 
an imputation of recent date. It was said that he had attempted the same 
practices during the reign of Vitellius. The Senators did not desist from 
threatening gestures, till he quitted the chamber; then passing to Paccius 
Africanus, they assailed him in the same way. It was he, they said, who had 
singled out as victims for Nero the brothers Scribonius, renowned for their 
mutual affection and for their wealth. Africanus dared not confess his 
guilt, and could not deny it; but he himself turned on Vibius Crispus, who 
was pressing him with questions, and complicating a charge which he could 
not rebut, shifted the

blame from himself by associating another 
with his guilt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="42"><p>Great was the 
reputation for brotherly affection, as well as for eloquence, which 
Vipstanus Messalla earned for himself on that day, by venturing, though not 
yet of Senatorial age, to plead for his brother Aquilius Regulus. The fall 
of the families of the Crassi and Orfitus had brought Regulus into the 
utmost odium. Of his own free will, as it seemed, and while still a mere 
youth, he had undertaken the prosecution, not to ward off any peril from 
himself, but in the hope of gaining power. The wife of Crassus, Sulpicia 
Pr&aelig;textata, and her four children were ready, should the Senate take 
cognizance of the cause, to demand vengeance. Accordingly, Messalla, without 
attempting to defend the case or the person accused, had simply thrown 
himself in the way of the perils that threatened his brother, and had thus 
wrought upon the feelings of several Senators. On this Curtius Montanus met 
him with a fierce speech, in which he went to the length of asserting, that 
after the death of Galba money had been given by Regulus to the murderer of 
Piso, and that he had even fastened his teeth in the murdered man's head. 
"Certainly," he said, "Nero did not compel this act; you did not secure by 
this piece of barbarity either your rank or your life. We may bear with the 
defence put forward by men who thought it better to destroy others than to 
come into peril themselves. As for you, the exile of your father, and the 
division of his property among his creditors, had left you perfectly safe, 
besides that your youth incapacitated you for office; there was nothing in 
you which Nero could either covet or dread. It was from sheer lust of 
slaughter and greed of gain that you, unknown as you were, you, who had 
never pleaded in any man's defence, steeped your soul in noble blood, when, 
though you had snatched from the very grave of your Country the spoils of a 
man of consular rank, had been fed to the full with seven million sesterces, 
and shone with all sacerdotal honours, you yet overwhelmed in one common 
ruin innocent boys, old men of illustrious name, and noble ladies, when you 
actually blamed the tardy movements of Nero in wearying himself and his 
informers with the overthrow of single families, and declared that the whole 
Senate might be destroyed by one word. Keep, Conscript Fathers,

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">PROCEEDINGS AGAINST INFORMERS</note>
preserve a man 
of such ready counsels, that every age may be furnished with its teacher, 
and that our young men may imitate Regulus, just as our old men imitate 
Marcellus and Crispus. Even unsuccessful villany finds some to emulate it: 
what will happen, if it flourish and be strong? And the man, whom we dare 
not offend when he holds only qu&aelig;stor's rank, are we to see him rise 
to the dignities of pr&aelig;tor and consul? Do you suppose that Nero will 
be the last of the tyrants? Those who survived Tiberius, those who survived 
Caligula, thought the same; and yet after each there arose another ruler yet 
more detestable and more cruel. We are not afraid of Vespasian; the age and 
moderation of the new Emperor reassure us. But the influence of an example 
outlives the individual character. We have lost our vigour, Conscript 
Fathers; we are no longer that Senate, which, when Nero had fallen, demanded 
that the informers and ministers of the tyrant should be punished according 
to ancient custom. The first day after the downfall of a wicked Emperor is 
the best of opportunities."</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="43"><p>Montanus 
was heard with such approval on the part of the Senate, that Helvidius 
conceived a hope that Marcellus also might be overthrown. He therefore began 
with a panegyric on Cluvius Rufus, who, though not less rich nor less 
renowned for eloquence, had never imperilled a single life in the days of 
Nero. By this comparison, as well as by direct accusations, he pressed 
Eprius hard, and stirred the indignation of the Senators. When Marcellus 
perceived this, he made as if he would leave the House, exclaiming, "We go, 
Priscus, and leave you your Senate; act the king, though C&aelig;sar himself 
be present." Crispus followed. Both were enraged, but their looks were 
different; Marcellus cast furious glances about him, while Crispus smiled. 
They were drawn back, however, into the Senate by the hasty interference of 
friends. The contest grew fiercer, while the well-disposed majority on the 
one side, and a powerful minority on the other, fought out their obstinate 
quarrel, and thus the day was spent in altercation.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44"><p>At the next meeting of the Senate C&aelig;sar began 
by recommending that the wrongs, the resentments, and the terrible 
necessities of former times, should be forgotten, and

Mucianus 
spoke at great length in favour of the informers. At the same time he 
admonished in gentle terms and in a tone of entreaty those who were reviving 
indictments, which they had before commenced and afterwards dropped. The 
Senators, when they found themselves opposed, relinquished the liberty which 
they had begun to exercise. That it might not be thought that the opinion of 
the Senate was disregarded, or that impunity was accorded to all acts done 
in the days of Nero, Mucianus sent back to their islands two men of 
Senatorial rank, Octavius Sagitta and Antistius Sosianus, who had quitted 
their places of banishment. Octavius had seduced one Pontia Postumia, and, 
on her refusing to marry him, in the frenzy of passion had murdered her. 
Sosianus by his depravity had brought many to ruin. Both had been condemned 
and banished by a solemn decision of the Senate, and, though others were 
permitted to return, were kept under the same penalty. But this did not 
mitigate the hatred felt against Mucianus. Sosianus and Sagitta were utterly 
insignificant, even if they did return; but men dreaded the abilities of the 
informers, their wealth, and the power which they exercised in many sinister 
ways.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="45"><p>A trial, conducted in the 
Senate according to ancient precedents, brought into harmony for a time the 
feelings of its members. Manlius Patruitus, a Senator, laid a complaint, 
that he had been beaten by a mob in the colony of <placeName key="tgn,7003168">Sena</placeName>, and that by order of the magistrates; that the 
wrong had not stopped here, but that lamentations and wailings, in fact a 
representation of funeral obsequies, had been enacted in his presence, 
accompanied with contemptuous and insulting expressions levelled against the 
whole Senate. The persons accused were summoned to appear, and after the 
case had been investigated, punishment was inflicted on those who were found 
guilty. A resolution of the Senate was also passed, recommending more 
orderly behaviour to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7003168">Sena</placeName>. About the 
same time Antonius Flamma was condemned under the law against extortion, at 
the suit of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, and was banished 
for cruel practices.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46"><p>Amidst all this 
a mutiny in the army all but broke out. The troops who, having been 
disbanded by Vitellius, had flocked to support Vespasian, asked leave to 
serve again in

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DISCONTENT IN ARMY</note>
the 
Pr&aelig;torian Guard, and the soldiers who had been selected from the 
legions with the same prospect now clamoured for their promised pay. Even 
the Vitellianists could not be got rid of without much bloodshed. But the 
money required for retaining in the service so vast a body of men was 
immensely large. Mucianus entered the camp to examine more accurately the 
individual claims. The victorious army, wearing their proper decorations and 
arms, he drew up with moderate intervals of space between the divisions; 
then the Vitellianists, whose capitulation at <placeName>Bovill&aelig;</placeName> I have already related, and the other 
troops of the party, who had been collected from the capital and its 
neighbourhood, were brought forth almost naked. Mucianus ordered these men 
to be drawn up apart, making the British, the German, and any other troops 
that there were belonging to other armies, take up separate positions. The 
very first view of their situation paralyzed them. They saw opposed to them 
what seemed a hostile array, threatening them with javelin and sword. They 
saw themselves hemmed in, without arms, filthy and squalid. And when they 
began to be separated, some to be marched to one spot, and some to another, 
a thrill of terror ran through them all. Among the troops from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> the panic was particularly great; for they 
believed that this separation marked them out for slaughter. They embraced 
their fellow-soldiers, clung to their necks, begged for parting kisses, and 
entreated that they might not be deserted, or doomed in a common cause to 
suffer a different lot. They invoked now Mucianus, now the absent Emperor, 
and, as a last resource, heaven and the Gods, till Mucianus came forward, 
and calling them "soldiers bound by the same oath and servants of the same 
Emperor," stopped the groundless panic. And indeed the victorious army 
seconded the tears of the vanquished with their approving shouts. This 
terminated the proceedings for that day. But when Domitian harangued them a 
few days afterwards, they received him with increased confidence. The land 
that was offered them they contemptuously rejected, and begged for regular 
service and pay. Theirs were prayers indeed, but such as it was impossible 
to reject. They were therefore received into the Pr&aelig;torian camp. Then 
such as had reached

the prescribed age, or had served the proper 
number of campaigns, received an honourable discharge; others were dismissed 
for misconduct; but this was done by degrees and in detail, always the 
safest mode of reducing the united strength of a multitude.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="47"><p>It is a fact that, whether suggested by real 
poverty or by a wish to give the appearance of it, a proposition passed the 
Senate to the effect that a loan of sixty million sesterces from private 
persons should be accepted. Pompeius Silvanus was appointed to manage the 
affair. Before long, either the necessity ceased or the pretence was 
dropped. After this, on the motion of Domitian, the consulships conferred by 
Vitellius were cancelled, and the honours of a censor's funeral were paid to 
Sabinus; great lessons both of the mutability of fortune, ever bringing 
together the highest honours and the lowest humiliations.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="48"><p>About the same time the proconsul Lucius Piso was 
murdered. I shall make the account of this murder as exact as possible by 
first reviewing a few earlier circumstances, which have a bearing; on the 
origin and motives of such deeds. The legion and the auxiliaries stationed 
in <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Africa</placeName> to guard the frontiers of the Empire were 
under the proconsul's authority during the reigns of the divine Augustus and 
Tiberius. But in course of time Caligula, prompted by his restless temper 
and by his fear of Marcus Silanus, who then held <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Africa</placeName>, took away the legion from the proconsul, and 
handed it over to a legate whom he sent for that purpose. The patronage was 
equally divided between the two officers. A source of disagreement was thus 
studiously sought in the continual clashing of their authority, and it was 
further developed by an unprincipled rivalry. The power of the legates grew 
through their lengthened tenure of office, and, perhaps, because an inferior 
feels greater interest in such a competition. All the more distinguished of 
the proconsuls cared more for security than for power.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="49"><p>At this time the legion in <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Africa</placeName> was commanded by Valerius Festus, a young man of 
extravagant habits and immoderate ambition, who was now made uneasy by his 
relationship to Vitellius. Whether this man in their frequent interviews 
tempted Piso to revolt, or whether he resisted

  <note anchored="yes" place="marg">PLOT AGAINST PISO IN <placeName key="tgn,7000639">AFRICA</placeName></note>
such 
overtures, is not known for certain, for no one was present at their 
confidential meetings, and, after Piso's death, many were disposed to 
ingratiate themselves with the murderer. There is no doubt that the province 
and the troops entertained feelings of hostility to Vespasian, and some of 
the Vitellianists, who had escaped from the capital, incessantly represented 
to Piso that <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> was hesitating and <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> ready to revolt, that his own position was 
perilous, and that for one who in peace must be suspected war was the safer 
course. While this was going on, Claudius Sagitta, prefect of Petra's Horse, 
making a very quick passage reached <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Africa</placeName> before 
Papirius, the centurion despatched by Mucianus. He declared that an order to 
put Piso to death had been given to the centurion, and that Galerianus, his 
cousin and son-in-law, had perished; that his only hope of safety was in 
bold action; that in such action two paths were open; he might defend 
himself on the spot, or he might sail for <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and 
offer his services as general to the Vitellianist armies. Piso was wholly 
unmoved by this statement. The centurion despatched by Mucianus, on landing 
in the port of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, raised his voice, and 
invoked in succession all blessings on the head of Piso, as if he were 
Emperor, and bade the bystanders, who were astonished by this sudden and 
strange proceeding, take up the same cry. The credulous mob rushed into the 
market-place, and demanded that Piso should shew himself. They threw 
everything into an uproar with their clamorous shouts of joy, careless of 
the truth, and only eager to flatter. Piso, acting on the information of 
Sagitta, or, perhaps, from natural modesty, would not make his appearance in 
public, or trust himself to the zeal of the populace. On questioning the 
centurion, and finding that he had sought a pretext for accusing and 
murdering him, he ordered the man to be executed, moved, not so much by any 
hope of saving his life, as by indignation against the assassin; for this 
fellow had been one of the murderers of Macer, and was now come to slay the 
proconsul with hands already stained with the blood of the legate. He then 
severely blamed the people of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> in an edict 
which betrayed his anxiety, and ceased to discharge even the usual duties of 
his office, shutting himself up in his palace, to guard against

any casual occurrence that might lead to a new outbreak.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="50"><p>But when the agitation of the people, the 
execution of the centurion, and other news, true or false, exaggerated as 
usual by report, came to the ears of Festus, he sent some cavalry to put 
Piso to death. They rode over at full speed, and broke into the dwelling of 
the proconsul in the dim light of early dawn, with their swords drawn in 
their hands. Many of them were unacquainted with the person of Piso, for the 
legate had selected some Moorish and Carthaginian auxiliaries to perpetrate 
the deed. Near the proconsul's chamber they chanced to meet a slave, and 
asked him who he was, and where Piso was to be found? The slave with a noble 
untruth replied, "I am he," and was immediately cut down. Soon after Piso 
was killed, for there was on the spot one who recognized him, B&aelig;bius 
Massa, one of the procurators of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Africa</placeName>, a name even 
then fatal to the good, and destined often to reappear among the causes of 
the sufferings which he had ere long to endure. From <placeName key="tgn,7015312">Adrumetum</placeName>, where he had stayed to watch the result, 
Festus went to the legion, and gave orders that Cetronius Pisanus, prefect 
of the camp, should be put in irons. He did this out of private pique, but 
he called the man an accomplice of Piso. Some few centurions and soldiers he 
punished, others he rewarded, neither the one nor the other deservedly, but 
he wished men to believe that he had extinguished a war. He then put an end 
to a quarrel between the &OElig;enses and the Leptitani, which, originating 
in robberies of corn and cattle by two rustic populations, had grown from 
this insignificant beginning till it was carried on in pitched battles. The 
people of <placeName key="tgn,7000630">&OElig;ea</placeName>, who were inferior in numbers, 
had summoned to their aid the Garamantes, a wild race incessantly occupied 
in robbing their neighbours. This had brought the Leptitani to extremities; 
their territories had been ravaged far and wide, and they were trembling 
within their walls, when the Garamantes were put to flight by the arrival of 
the auxiliary infantry and cavalry, and the whole of the booty was 
recaptured, with the exception of some which the plunderers, in their 
wanderings through inaccessible hamlets, had sold to more distant 
tribes.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="51"><p>Vespasian had heard of the 
victory of <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName>, and

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">REPORTS TO VESPASIAN IN <placeName key="tgn,7016833">EGYPT</placeName></note>
had 
received favourable tidings from all quarters, and he was now informed of 
the fall of Vitellius by many persons of every rank, who, with a good 
fortune equal to their courage, risked the perils of the wintry sea. Envoys 
had come from king Vologesus to offer him 40,000 Parthian cavalry. It was a 
matter of pride and joy to him to be courted with such splendid offers of 
help from the allies, and not to want them. He thanked Vologesus, and 
recommended him to send ambassadors to the Senate, and to learn for himself 
that peace had been restored. While his thoughts were fixed on <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and on the state of the capital, he heard an 
unfavourable account of Domitian, which represented him as over-stepping the 
limits of his age and the privileges of a son. He therefore entrusted Titus 
with the main strength of the army to complete what had yet to be done in 
the Jewish war.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="52"><p>It was said that 
Titus before his departure had a long interview with his father, in which he 
implored him not to let himself be easily excited by the reports of 
slanderers, but to shew an impartial and forgiving temper towards his son. 
"Legions and fleets," he reminded him, "are not such sure bulwarks of 
Imperial power as a numerous family. As for friends, time, altered fortunes, 
perhaps their passions or their errors, may weaken, may change, may even 
destroy, their affection. A man's own race can never be dissociated from 
him, least of all with Princes, whose prosperity is shared by others, while 
their reverses touch but their nearest kin. Even between brothers there can 
be no lasting affection, except the father sets the example." Vespasian, 
delighted with the brotherly affection of Titus rather than reconciled to 
Domitian, bade his son be of good cheer, and aggrandise the State by war and 
deeds of arms. He would himself provide for the interests of peace, and for 
the welfare of his family. He then had some of the swiftest vessels laden 
with corn, and committed them to the perils of the still stormy sea. <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> indeed was in the very critical position of not 
having more than ten days' consumption in the granaries, when the supplies 
from Vespasian arrived.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="53"><p>The work of 
rebuilding the Capitol was assigned by him to Lucius Vestinius, a man of the 
Equestrian order,

who, however, for high character and reputation 
ranked among the nobles. The soothsayers whom he assembled directed that the 
remains of the old shrine should be removed to the marshes, and the new 
temple raised on the original site. The Gods, they said, forbade the old 
form to be changed. On the 21st of June, beneath a cloudless sky, the entire 
space devoted to the sacred enclosure was encompassed with chaplets and 
garlands. Soldiers, who bore auspicious names, entered the precincts with 
sacred boughs. Then the vestal virgins, with a troop of boys and girls, 
whose fathers and mothers were still living, sprinkled the whole space with 
water drawn from the fountains and rivers. After this, Helvidius Priscus, 
the pr&aelig;tor, first purified the spot with the usual sacrifice of a sow, 
a sheep, and a bull, and duly placed the entrails on turf; then, in terms 
dictated by Publius &AElig;lianus, the high-priest, besought Jupiter, Juno, 
Minerva, and the tutelary deities of the place, to prosper the undertaking, 
and to lend their divine help to raise the abodes which the piety of men had 
founded for them. He then touched the wreaths, which were wound round the 
foundation stone and entwined with the ropes, while at the same moment all 
the other magistrates of the State, the Priests, the Senators, the Knights, 
and a number of the citizens, with zeal and joy uniting their efforts, 
dragged the huge stone along. Contributions of gold and silver and virgin 
ores, never smelted in the furnace, but still in their natural state, were 
showered on the foundations. The soothsayers had previously directed that no 
stone or gold which had been intended for any other purpose should profane 
the work. Additional height was given to the structure; this was the only 
variation which religion would permit, and the one feature which had been 
thought wanting in the splendour of the old temple.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="54"><p>Meanwhile the tidings of the death of Vitellius, 
spreading through <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, had caused a second war. Civilis had thrown 
aside all disguise, and was now openly assailing the Roman power, while the 
legions of Vitellius preferred even a foreign yoke to the rule of Vespasian. 
<rs type="placename">Gaul</rs> had gathered fresh courage from the belief that 
the fortunes of our armies had been everywhere disastrous; for a report

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CAPITOL RESTORED</note>
was rife that our winter 
camps in <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName> were hemmed in by the Sarmatians and Dacians. 
 Rumours equally false were circulated respecting <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. Above all, the conflagration of the Capitol had 
made them believe that the end of the Roman Empire was at hand. The Gauls, 
they remembered, had captured the city in former days, but, as the abode of 
Jupiter was uninjured, the Empire had survived; whereas now the Druids 
declared, with the prophetic utterances of an idle superstition, that this 
fatal conflagration was a sign of the anger of heaven, and portended 
universal empire for the Transalpine nations. A rumour had also gone forth 
that the chiefs of <rs type="placename">Gaul</rs>, whom Otho had sent against 
Vitellius, had, before their departure, bound themselves by a compact not to 
fail the cause of freedom, should the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> 
be broken by a continuous succession of civil wars and internal 
calamities.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="55"><p>Before the murder of 
Flaccus Hordeonius nothing had come out by which any conspiracy could be 
discovered. After his death, messengers passed to and fro between Civilis 
and Classicus, commander of the cavalry of the Treveri. Classicus was first 
among his countrymen in rank and wealth; he was of a royal house, of a race 
distinguished both in peace and war, and he himself claimed to be by family 
tradition the foe rather than the ally of the Romans. Julius Tutor and 
Julius Sabinus joined him in his schemes. One was a Trever, the other a 
Lingon. Tutor had been made by Vitellius guardian of the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>. Sabinus, over and above his natural vanity, was 
inflamed with the pride of an imaginary descent, for he asserted that his 
great-grandmother had, by her personal charms, attracted the admiration of 
the divine Julius, when he was campaigning in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. 
These two men held secret conferences to sound the views of the rest of 
their countrymen, and when they had secured as accomplices such as they 
thought suitable for their purpose, they met together in a private house in 
the <placeName key="tgn,7004446">Colonia Agrippinensis</placeName>; for the State in its 
public policy was strongly opposed to all such attempts. Some, however, of 
the Ubii and Tungri were present, but the Treveri and Lingones had the 
greatest weight in the matter. Nor could they endure the delay of 
deliberation; they rivalled each other in

vehement assertions 
that the Romans were in a frenzy of discord, that their legions had been cut 
to pieces, that <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was laid waste, that <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself was at that very moment undergoing capture, 
while all her armies were occupied by wars of their own. If they were but to 
secure the passes of the <placeName>Alps</placeName> with bodies of troops, 
<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, with her own freedom firmly established, might 
look about her, and fix the limits of her dominion.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="56"><p>These views were no sooner stated than approved. As 
to the survivors of the Vitellianist army, they doubted what to do; many 
voted for putting to death men so turbulent and faithless, stained too with 
the blood of their generals. Still the policy of mercy prevailed. To cut off 
all hope of quarter might provoke an obstinate resistance. It would be 
better to draw them into friendly union. If only the legates of the legions 
were put to death, the remaining multitude, moved by the consciousness of 
guilt and the hope of escape, would readily join their cause. Such was the 
outline of their original plan. Emissaries were likewise despatched 
throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> to stir up war, while they 
themselves feigned submission, that they might be the better able to crush 
the unsuspecting Vocula. Persons, however, were found to convey information 
to him, but he had not sufficient strength to suppress the movement, as the 
legions were incomplete in numbers and disloyal. So, what with soldiers of 
doubtful fidelity and secret enemies, he thought it best, under the 
circumstances, to make his way by meeting deceit with deceit, and by using 
the same arts with which he was himself assailed. He therefore went down to 
the <placeName key="tgn,7004446">Colonia Agrippinensis</placeName>. Thither Claudius Labeo, 
who, as I have related, had been taken prisoner and sent out of the province 
into the country of the Frisii, made his escape by bribing his gaolers. This 
man undertook, if a force were given him, to enter the Batavian territory 
and bring back to the Roman alliance the more influential part of that 
State; but, though he obtained a small force of infantry and cavalry, he did 
not venture to attempt anything among the Batavi, but only induced some of 
the Nervii and Betasii to take up arms, and made continual attacks on the 
Canninefates and the Marsaci more in the way of robbery than of 
war.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="57">
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS SCHEMES FURTHER</note><p>Lured on by the treacherous representations of the 
Gauls, Vocula marched against the enemy. He was near the Old Camp, when 
Classicus and Tutor, who had gone on in advance under the pretence of 
reconnoitring, concluded an agreement with the German chiefs. They then for 
the first time separated themselves from the legions, and formed a camp of 
their own, with a separate line of entrenchment, while Vocula protested that 
the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was not so utterly shaken by civil 
war as to have become contemptible even to Treveri and Lingones. "There are 
still," he said, "faithful provinces, victorious armies, the fortune of the 
Empire, and avenging Gods. Thus it was that Sacrovir and the &AElig;dui in 
former days, Vindex and the Gauls in more recent times, were crushed in a 
single battle. The breakers of treaties may look for the vengeance of the 
same Deities, and the same doom. Julius and Augustus understood far better 
the character of the people. Galba's policy and the diminution of their 
tribute have inspired them with hostile feelings. They are now enemies, 
because their yoke is easy; when they have been plundered and stripped, they 
will be friends." After uttering this defiance, finding that Classicus and 
Tutor persisted in their treachery, he changed his line of march, and 
retired to <placeName>Novesium</placeName>. The Gauls encamped at a 
distance of two miles, and plied with bribes the centurions and soldiers who 
visited them there, striving to make a Roman army commit the unheard-of 
baseness of swearing allegiance to foreigners, and pledge itself to the 
perpetration of this atrocious crime by murdering or imprisoning its 
officers. Vocula, though many persons advised him to escape, thought it best 
to be bold, and, summoning an assembly, spoke as follows.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p>"Never, when I have addressed you, have I felt more 
anxious for your welfare, never more indifferent about my own. Of the 
destruction that threatens me I can hear with cheerfulness; and amid so many 
evils I look forward to death as the end of my sufferings. For you I feel 
shame and compassion. Against you indeed no hostile ranks are gathering. 
That would be but the lawful course of war, and the right which an enemy may 
claim. But Classicus hopes to wage with your strength his war against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and proudly

offers to your allegiance 
an empire of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. Though our fortune and courage 
have for the moment failed us, have we so utterly forgotten the old memories 
of those many times when the legions of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> 
resolved to perish but not to be driven from their post? Often have our 
allies endured to see their cities destroyed, and with their wives and 
children to die in the flames, with only this reward in their death, the 
glory of untarnished loyalty. At this very moment our legions at the Old 
Camp are suffering the horrors of famine and of siege, and cannot be shaken 
by threats or by promises. We, besides our arms, our numbers, and the 
singular strength of our fortifications, have corn and supplies sufficient 
for a campaign however protracted. We had lately money enough even to 
furnish a donative; and, whether you choose to refer the bounty to Vitellius 
or Vespasian, it was at any rate from a Roman Emperor that you received it. 
If you, who have been victorious in so many campaigns, who have so often 
routed the enemy at <placeName key="tgn,7005980">Gelduba</placeName> and at the Old Camp, yet 
shrink from battle, this indeed is an unworthy fear. Still you have an 
entrenched camp; you have fortifications and the means of prolonging the 
war, till succouring armies pour in from the neighbouring provinces. It may 
be that I do not satisfy you; you may fall back on other legates or 
tribunes, on some centurion, even on some common soldier. Let not this 
monstrous news go forth to the whole world, that with you in their train 
Civilis and Classicus are about to invade <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. 
Should the Germans and the Gauls lead you to the walls of the capital, will 
you lift up arms against your Country? My soul shudders at the imagination 
of so horrible a crime. Will you mount guard for Tutor, the Trever? Shall a 
Batavian give the signal for battle? Will you serve as recruits in the 
German battalions? What will be the issue of your wickedness when the Roman 
legions are marshalled against you? Will you be a second time deserters, a 
second time traitors, and brave the anger of heaven while you waver between 
your old and your new allegiance? I implore and entreat thee, O Jupiter, 
supremely good and great, to whom through eight hundred and twenty years we 
have paid the honours of so many triumphs, and thou, Quirinus father of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that, if it be not your pleas-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VOCULA'S SPEECH AND DEATH</note>
ure that this camp should be 
preserved pure and inviolate under my command, you will at least not suffer 
it to be polluted and defiled by a Tutor and a Classicus. Grant that the 
soldiers of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> may either be innocent of crime, or 
at least experience a repentance speedy and without remorse."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="59"><p>They received his speech with feelings that varied 
between hope, fear, and shame. Vocula then left them, and was preparing to 
put an end to his life, when his freedmen and slaves prevented him from 
anticipating by his own act a most miserable death. Classicus despatched one 
&AElig;milius Longinus, a deserter from the first legion, and speedily 
accomplished the murder. With respect to the two legates, Herennius and 
Numisius, it was thought enough to put them in chains. Classicus then 
assumed the insignia of Roman Imperial power, and entered the camp. Hardened 
though he was to every sort of crime, he could only find words enough to go 
through the form of oath. All who were present swore allegiance to the 
empire of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. He distinguished the murderer of 
Vocula by high promotion, and the others by rewards proportioned to their 
services in crime. </p>
<p>Tutor and Classicus then divided the management of 
 the war between them. Tutor, investing the <placeName key="tgn,7004446">Colonia 
Agrippinensis</placeName> with a strong force, compelled the inhabitants and all 
 the troops on the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Upper Rhine</placeName> to take the same oath. 
 He did this after having first put to death the tribunes at <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>, and driven away the prefect of the camp, 
because they refused obedience. Classicus picked out all the most 
unprincipled men from the troops who had capitulated, and bade them go to 
the besieged, and offer them quarter, if they would accept the actual state 
of affairs; otherwise there was no hope for them; they would have to endure 
famine, the sword, and the direst extremities. The messengers whom he sent 
supported their representations by their own example.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="60"><p>The ties of loyalty on the one hand, and the 
necessities of famine on the other, kept the besieged wavering between the 
alternatives of glory and infamy. While they thus hesitated, all usual and 
even unusual kinds of food failed them, for they had consumed their horses 
and beasts of burden and all the other animals, which, though unclean

and disgusting, necessity compelled them to use. At last they tore up 
shrubs and roots and the grass that grew between the stones, and thus shewed 
an example of patience under privations, till at last they shamefully 
tarnished the lustre of their fame by sending envoys to Civilis to beg for 
their lives. Their prayers were not heard, till they swore allegiance to the 
empire of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. Civilis then stipulated for the 
plunder of the camp, and appointed guards who were to secure the treasure, 
the camp-followers, and the baggage, and accompany them as they departed, 
stripped of everything. About five miles from the spot the Germans rose upon 
them, and attacked them as they marched without thought of danger. The 
bravest were cut down where they stood; the greater part, as they were 
scattered in flight. The rest made their escape to the camp, while Civilis 
certainly complained of the proceeding, and upbraided the Germans with 
breaking faith by this atrocious act. Whether this was mere hypocrisy, or 
whether he was unable to restrain their fury, is not positively stated. They 
plundered and then fired the camp, and all who survived the battle the 
flames destroyed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="61"><p>Then Civilis 
fulfilled a vow often made by barbarians; his hair, which he had let grow 
long and coloured with a red dye from the day of taking up arms against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he now cut short, when the destruction of the 
legions had been accomplished. It was also said that he set up some of the 
prisoners as marks for his little son to shoot at with a child's arrows and 
javelins. He neither took the oath of allegiance to <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> himself, nor obliged any Batavian to do so, for he 
relied on the resources of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and felt that, 
should it be necessary to fight for empire with the Gauls, he should have on 
his side a great name and superior strength. Munius Lupercus, legate of one 
of the legions, was sent along with other gifts to Veleda, a maiden of the 
tribe of the Bructeri, who possessed extensive dominion; for by ancient 
usage the Germans attributed to many of their women prophetic powers and, as 
the superstition grew in strength, even actual divinity. The authority of 
Veleda was then at its height, because she had foretold the success of the 
Germans and the destruction of the legions. Lupercus, however, was murdered 
on the road. A few of the centurions and tribunes, who were

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">REBELLION SPREADS</note>
natives of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, 
were reserved as hostages for the maintenance of the alliance. The winter 
encampments of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry and of the legions, with 
the sole exception of those at <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017421">Vindonissa</placeName>, were pulled down and burnt.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="62"><p>The 16th legion, with the auxiliary troops that 
capitulated at the same time, received orders to march from <placeName>Novesium</placeName> to the <placeName>Colony of the 
Treveri</placeName>, a day having been fixed by which they were to quit the camp. 
The whole of this interval they spent in many anxious thoughts. The cowards 
trembled to think of those who had been massacred at the Old Camp; the 
better men blushed with shame at the infamy of their position. "What a march 
is this before us!" they cried, "Who will lead us on our way? Our all is at 
the disposal of those whom we have made our masters for life or death." 
Others, without the least sense of their disgrace, stowed away about their 
persons their money and what else they prized most highly, while some got 
their arms in readiness, and girded on their weapons as if for battle. While 
they were thus occupied, the time for their departure arrived, and proved 
even more dismal than their anticipation. For in their intrenchments their 
woeful appearance had not been so noticeable; the open plain and the light 
of day revealed their disgrace. The images of the Emperors were torn down; 
the standards were borne along without their usual honours, while the 
banners of the Gauls glittered on every side. The train moved on in silence 
like a long funeral procession. Their leader was Claudius Sanctus; one of 
his eyes had been destroyed; he was repulsive in countenance and even more 
feeble in intellect. The guilt of the troops seemed to be doubled, when the 
other legion, deserting the camp at <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName>, joined 
their ranks. When the report of the capture of the legions became generally 
known, all who but a short time before trembled at the name of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> rushed forth from the fields and houses, and spread 
themselves everywhere to enjoy with extravagant delight the strange 
spectacle. The Picentine Horse could not endure the triumph of the insulting 
rabble, and, disregarding the promises and threats of Sanctus, rode off to 
 <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>. Chancing to fall in with Longinus, the 
murderer of Vocula, they over-

whelmed him with a shower of 
darts, and thus made a beginning towards a future expiation of their guilt. 
The legions did not change the direction of their march, and encamped under 
the walls of the colony of the Treveri.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="63"><p>Elated with their success, Civilis and Classicus doubted whether 
 they should not give up the <placeName key="tgn,7004446">Colonia Agrippinensis</placeName> to 
be plundered by their troops. Their natural ferocity and lust for spoil 
prompted them to destroy the city; but the necessities of war, and the 
advantage of a character for clemency to men founding a new empire, forbade 
them to do so. Civilis was also influenced by recollections of kindness 
received; for his son, who at the beginning of the war had been arrested in 
the Colony, had been kept in honourable custody. But the tribes beyond the 
 <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> disliked the place for its wealth and 
increasing power, and held that the only possible way of putting an end to 
war would be, either to make it an open city for all Germans, or to destroy 
it and so disperse the Ubii.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="64"><p>Upon this 
 the Tencteri, a tribe separated by the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> from 
the Colony, sent envoys with orders to make known their instructions to the 
Senate of the Agrippinenses. These orders the boldest spirit among the 
ambassadors thus expounded: "For your return into the unity of the German 
nation and name we give thanks to the Gods whom we worship in common and to 
Mars, the chief of our divinities, and we congratulate you that at length 
you will live as free men among the free. Up to this day have the Romans 
closed river and land and, in a way, the very air, that they may bar our 
converse and prevent our meetings, or, what is a still worse insult to men 
born to arms, may force us to assemble unarmed and all but stripped, watched 
by sentinels, and taxed for the privilege. But that our friendship and union 
may be established for ever, we require of you to strip your city of its 
walls, which are the bulwarks of slavery. Even savage animals, if you keep 
them in confinement, forget their natural courage. We require of you to 
massacre all Romans within your territory; liberty and a dominant race 
cannot well exist together. Let the property of the slain come into a common 
stock, so that no one may be able to secrete anything, or to detach his own 
interest from ours.

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">POSITION OF <placeName key="tgn,7004446">COLOGNE</placeName></note>
Let it be lawful for us and for you to 
inhabit both banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, as it was of old 
for our ancestors. As nature has given light and air to all men, so has she 
thrown open every land to the brave. Resume the manners and customs of your 
country, renouncing the pleasures, through which, rather than through their 
arms, the Romans secure their power against subject nations. A pure and 
untainted race, forgetting your past bondage, you will be the equals of all, 
or will even rule over others."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="65"><p>The 
inhabitants of the Colony took time for deliberation, and, as dread of the 
future would not allow them to accept the offered terms, while their actual 
condition forbade an open and contemptuous rejection, they replied to the 
following effect: "The very first chance of freedom that presented itself we 
seized with more eagerness than caution, that we might unite ourselves with 
you and the other Germans, our kinsmen by blood. With respect to our 
fortifications, as at this very moment the Roman armies are assembling, it 
is safer for us to strengthen than to destroy them. All strangers from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> or the provinces, that may have been in our 
territory, have either perished in the war, or have fled to their own homes. 
As for those who in former days settled here, and have been united to us by 
marriage, and as for their offspring, this is their native land. We cannot 
think you so unjust as to wish that we should slay our parents, our 
brothers, and our children. All duties and restrictions on trade we repeal. 
Let there be a free passage across the river, but let it be during the 
day-time and for persons unarmed, till the new and recent privileges assume 
by usage the stability of time. As arbiters between us we will have Civilis 
and Veleda; under their sanction the treaty shall be ratified." The Tencteri 
were thus appeased, and ambassadors were sent with presents to Civilis and 
Veleda, who settled everything to the satisfaction of the inhabitants of the 
Colony. They were not, however, allowed to approach or address Veleda 
herself. In order to inspire them with more respect they were prevented from 
seeing her. She dwelt in a lofty tower, and one of her relatives, chosen for 
the purpose, conveyed, like the messenger of a divinity, the questions and 
answers.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="66"><p>Thus strengthened 
 by his alliance with the <placeName key="tgn,7004446">Colonia Agrippinensis</placeName>, 
Civilis resolved to attach to himself the neighbouring States, or to make 
war on them if they offered any opposition. He occupied the territory of the 
Sunici, and formed the youth of the country into regular cohorts. To hinder 
his further advance, Claudius Labeo encountered him with a hastily assembled 
force of Betasii, Tungri, and Nervii, relying on the strength of his 
position, as he had occupied a bridge over the river <placeName>Mosa</placeName>. They fought in a narrow defile without any decided 
result, till the Germans swam across and attacked Labeo's rear. At the same 
moment, Civilis, acting either on some bold impulse or by a preconcerted 
plan, rushed into the Tungrian column, exclaiming in a loud voice, "We have 
not taken up arms in order that the Batavi and Treveri may rule over the 
nations. Far from us be such arrogance! Accept our alliance. I am ready to 
join your ranks, whether you would prefer me to be your general or your 
comrade." The multitude was moved by the appeal, and were beginning to 
sheathe their swords, when Campanus and Juvenalis, two of the Tungrian 
chieftains, surrendered the whole tribe to Civilis. Labeo made his escape 
before he could be intercepted. The Betasii and Nervii, also capitulating, 
were incorporated by Civilis into his army. He now commanded vast resources, 
as the States were either completely cowed, or else were naturally inclined 
in his favour.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="67"><p>Meanwhile Julius 
Sabinus, after having thrown down the pillars that recorded the treaty with 
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, bade his followers salute him as Emperor, and 
hastened at the head of a large and undisciplined crowd of his countrymen to 
attack the Sequani, a neighbouring people, still faithful to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The Sequani did not decline the contest. Fortune 
favoured the better cause, and the Lingones were defeated. Sabinus fled from 
the battle with a cowardice equal to the rashness with which he had 
precipitated it, and, in order to spread a report of his death, he set fire 
to a country-house where he had taken refuge. It was believed that he there 
perished by a death of his own seeking. The various shifts by which he 
contrived to conceal himself and to prolong his life for nine years, the 
firm fidelity of his friends, and the noble example

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DISASTERS; EFFECTS AT <placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName></note>
of his 
wife Epponina, I shall relate in their proper place. By this victory of the 
Sequani the tide of war was stayed. The States began by degrees to recover 
their senses, and to reflect on the claims of justice and of treaties. The 
Remi were foremost in this movement, announcing throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> that deputies were to be sent to consult in common 
assembly whether they should make freedom or peace their object.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="68"><p>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> report 
exaggerated all these disasters, and disturbed Mucianus with the fear that 
the generals, though distinguished men (for he had already appointed Gallus 
Annius and Petilius Cerialis to the command), would be unequal to the weight 
of so vast a war. Yet the capital could not be left without a ruler, and men 
feared the ungoverned passions of Domitian, while Primus Antonius and Varus 
Arrius were also, as I have said, objects of suspicion. Varus, who had been 
made commander of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard, had still at his disposal much 
military strength. Mucianus ejected him from his office, and, not to leave 
him without consolation, made him superintendent of the sale of corn. To 
pacify the feelings of Domitian, which were not unfavourable to Varus, he 
appointed Arretinus Clemens, who was closely connected with the house of 
Vespasian, and who was also a great favourite with Domitian, to the command 
of the Pr&aelig;torian Guard, alleging that his father, in the reign of 
Caligula, had admirably discharged the duties of that office. The old name, 
he said, would please the soldiers, and Clemens himself, though on the roll 
of Senators, would be equal to both duties. He selected the most eminent men 
in the State to accompany him, while others were appointed through interest. 
At the same time Domitian and Mucianus prepared to set out, but in a very 
different mood; Domitian in all the hope and impatience of youth, Mucianus 
ever contriving delays to check his ardent companion, who, he feared, were 
he to intrude himself upon the army, might be led by the recklessness of 
youth or by bad advisers to compromise at once the prospects of war and of 
peace. Two of the victorious legions, the 6th and 8th, the 21st, which 
belonged to the Vitellianist army, the 2nd, which consisted of new levies, 
were marched into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, some over the <placeName key="tgn,7007843">Penine</placeName> and <placeName>Cottian</placeName>, some over 
 the <placeName key="tgn,7007763">Graian Alps</placeName>. The 14th legion

were 
summoned from <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, and the 6th and 10th from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>. Thus rumours of an advancing army, as well as 
their own temper, inclined the States of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> which 
assembled in the country of the Remi to more peaceful counsels. Envoys from 
the Treveri were awaiting them there, and among them Tullius Valentinus, the 
most vehement promoter of the war, who in a set speech poured forth all the 
charges usually made against great empires, and levelled against the Roman 
people many insulting and exasperating expressions. The man was a turbulent 
fomenter of sedition, and pleased many by his frantic eloquence.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="69"><p>On the other hand Julius Auspex, one of the 
leading chieftains among the Remi, dwelt on the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and the advantages of peace. Pointing out that war 
might be commenced indeed by cowards, but must be carried on at the peril of 
the braver spirits, and that the Roman legions were close at hand, he 
restrained the most prudent by considerations of respect and loyalty, and 
held back the younger by representations of danger and appeals to fear. The 
result was, that, while they extolled the spirit of Valentinus, they 
followed the counsels of Auspex. It is certain that the Treveri and Lingones 
were injured in the eyes of the Gallic nations by their having sided with 
Verginius in the movement of Vindex. Many were deterred by the mutual 
jealousy of the provinces. "Where," they asked, "could a head be found for 
the war? Where could they look for civil authority, and the sanction of 
religion? If all went well with them, what city could they select as the 
seat of empire?" The victory was yet to be gained; dissension had already 
begun. One State angrily boasted of its alliances, another of its wealth and 
military strength, or of the antiquity of its origin. Disgusted with the 
prospect of the future, they acquiesced in their present condition. Letters 
were written to the Treveri in the name of the states of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, requiring them to abstain from hostilities, and 
reminding them that pardon might yet be obtained, and that friends were 
ready to intercede for them, should they repent. Valentinus still opposed, 
and succeeded in closing the ears of his countrymen to this advice, though 
he was not so diligent in preparing for war as he was assiduous in 
haranguing.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="70">
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">DISUNITY AMONG 
REBELS</note><p>Accordingly neither the 
Treveri, the Lingones, nor the other revolted States, took measures at all 
proportioned to the magnitude of the peril they had incurred. Even their 
generals did not act in concert. Civilis was traversing the pathless wilds 
of the Belg&aelig; in attempting to capture Claudius Labeo, or to drive him 
out of the country. Classicus for the most part wasted his time in indolent 
repose, as if he had only to enjoy an empire already won. Even Tutor made no 
haste to occupy with troops the upper bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> and the passes of the <placeName>Alps</placeName>. Meanwhile the 21st legion, by way of <placeName key="tgn,7017421">Vindonissa</placeName>, and Sextilius Felix with the auxiliary 
 infantry, by way of <placeName key="tgn,7013254">Rh&aelig;tia</placeName>, penetrated into 
the province. They were joined by the Singularian Horse, which had been 
raised some time before by Vitellius, and had afterwards gone over to the 
side of Vespasian. Their commanding officer was Julius Briganticus. He was 
sister's son to Civilis, and he was hated by his uncle and hated him in 
return with all the extreme bitterness of a family feud. Tutor, having 
augmented the army of the Treveri with fresh levies from the Vangiones, the 
C&aelig;racates, and the Triboci, strengthened it with a force of veteran 
infantry and cavalry, men from the legions whom he had either corrupted by 
promises or overborne by intimidation. Their first act was to cut to pieces 
a cohort, which had been sent on in advance by Sextilius Felix; soon 
afterwards, however, on the approach of the Roman generals at the head of 
their army, they returned to their duty by an act of honourable desertion, 
and the Triboci, Vangiones, and C&aelig;racates, followed their example. 
Avoiding <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>, Tutor retired with the Treveri 
 to <placeName key="tgn,7012309">Bingium</placeName>, trusting to the strength of the 
position, as he had broken down the bridge over the river <placeName>Nava</placeName>. A sudden attack, however, was made by the infantry 
under the command of Sextilius; a ford was discovered, and he found himself 
betrayed and routed. The Treveri were panic-stricken by this disaster, and 
the common people threw down their arms, and dispersed themselves through 
the country. Some of the chiefs, anxious to seem the first to cease from 
hostilities, fled to those States which had not renounced the Roman 
alliance. The legions, which had been removed, as I have before related, 
from <placeName>Novesium</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName> to 
the ter-

ritory of the Treveri, voluntarily swore allegiance to 
Vespasian. These proceedings took place in the absence of Valentinus. When 
he returned, full of fury and bent on again throwing everything into 
confusion and ruin, the legions withdrew to the Mediomatrici, a people in 
alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Valentinus and Tutor again 
involved the Treveri in war, and murdered the two legates, Herennius and 
Numisius, that by diminishing the hope of pardon they might strengthen the 
bond of crime.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="71"><p>Such was the state of 
 the war, when Petilius Cerialis reached <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName>. 
Great expectations were raised by his arrival. Eager for battle, and more 
ready to despise than to be on his guard against the enemy, he fired the 
spirit of the troops by his bold language; for he would, he said, fight 
without a moment's delay, as soon as it was possible to meet the foe. The 
levies which had been raised in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> he ordered back 
to their respective States, with instructions to proclaim that the legions 
sufficed to defend the Empire, and that the allies might return to the 
duties of peace, secure in the thought that a war which Roman arms had 
undertaken was finished. This proceeding strengthened the loyalty of the 
Gauls. Now that their youth were restored to them they could more easily 
bear the burden of the tribute; and, finding themselves despised, they were 
more ready to obey. Civilis and Classicus, having heard of the defeat of 
Tutor and of the rout of the Treveri, and indeed of the complete success of 
the enemy, hastened in their alarm to concentrate their own scattered 
forces, and meanwhile sent repeated messages to Valentinus, warning him not 
to risk a decisive battle. This made Cerialis move with more rapidity. He 
sent to the Mediomatrici persons commissioned to conduct the legions which 
were there by the shortest route against the enemy; and, collecting such 
troops as there were at <placeName key="tgn,7004449">Mogontiacum</placeName> and such as he 
had brought with himself, he arrived in three days' march at <placeName>Rigodulum</placeName>. Valentinus, at the head of a large body of 
Treveri, had occupied this position, which was protected by hills, and by 
the river <placeName key="tgn,7002972">Mosella</placeName>. He had also strengthened it with 
ditches and breastworks of stones. These defences, however, did not deter 
the Roman general from ordering his infantry to the assault, and making 
his

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CERIALIS DIRECTS ROMANS</note>
cavalry 
advance up the hill; he scorned the enemy, whose forces, hastily levied, 
could not, he knew, derive any advantage from their position, but what would 
be more than counterbalanced by the courage of his own men. There was some 
little delay in the ascent, while the troops were passing through the range 
of the enemy's missiles. As soon as they came to close fighting, the 
barbarians were dislodged and hurled like a falling house from their 
position. A detachment of the cavalry rode round where the hills were less 
steep, and captured the principal Belgic chiefs, and among them Valentinus, 
their general.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="72"><p>On the following day 
Cerialis entered the <placeName>Colony of the Treveri</placeName>. The 
soldiers were eager to destroy the city, "This," they said, "is the 
birthplace of Classicus and Tutor; it was by the treason of these men that 
our legions were besieged and massacred. What had <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> done like this, <placeName key="perseus,Cremona">Cremona</placeName> 
which was torn from the very bosom of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, because 
it had occasioned to the conquerors the delay of a single night? Here on the 
borders of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> stands unharmed a city which 
exults in the spoils of our armies and the blood of our generals. Let the 
plunder be brought into the Imperial treasury; we shall be satisfied with 
the fire that will destroy a rebellious colony and compensate for the 
overthrow of so many camps." Cerialis, fearing the disgrace of being thought 
to have imbued his soldiers with a spirit of licence and cruelty, checked 
their fury. They submitted, for, now that civil war was at an end, they were 
tractable enough in dealing with an enemy. Their thoughts were then diverted 
by the pitiable aspect of the legions which had been summoned from the 
Mediomatrici. They stood oppressed by the consciousness of guilt, their eyes 
fixed on the earth. No friendly salutations passed between the armies as 
they met, they made no answer to those who would console or encourage them, 
but hid themselves in their tents, and shrank from the very light of day. 
Nor was it so much their peril or their alarm that confounded them, as their 
shame and humiliation. Even the conquerors were struck dumb, and dared not 
utter a word of entreaty, but pleaded for pardon by their silent tears, till 
Cerialis at last soothed their minds by declaring that destiny had brought 
about all that had hap-

pened through the discords of soldiers 
and generals or through the treachery of the foe. They must consider that 
day as the first of their military service and of their allegiance. Their 
past crimes would be remembered neither by the Emperor nor by himself. They 
were thus admitted into the same camp with the rest, and an order was read 
in every company, that no soldier was in any contention or altercation to 
reproach a comrade with mutiny or defeat.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="73"><p>Cerialis then convoked an assembly of the Treveri and Lingones, 
and thus addressed them: "I have never cultivated eloquence; it is by my 
sword that I have asserted the excellence of the Roman people. Since, 
however, words have very great weight with you, since you estimate good and 
evil, not according to their real value, but according to the 
representations of seditious men, I have resolved to say a few words, which, 
as the war is at an end, it may be useful for you to have heard rather than 
for me to have spoken. Roman generals and Emperors entered your territory, 
as they did the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, with no ambitious 
purposes, but at the solicitation of your ancestors, who were wearied to the 
last extremity by intestine strife, while the Germans, whom they had 
summoned to their help, had imposed their yoke alike on friend and foe. How 
many battles we have fought against the Cimbri and Teutones, at the cost of 
what hardships to our armies, and with what result we have waged our German 
wars, is perfectly well known. It was not to defend <placeName key="1000080">Italy</placeName> that we occupied the borders of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, but to insure that no second Ariovistus should 
seize the empire of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. Do you fancy yourselves to 
be dearer in the eyes of Civilis and the Batavi and the Transrhenane tribes, 
than your fathers and grandfathers were to their ancestors? There have ever 
been the same causes at work to make the Germans cross over into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, lust, avarice, and the longing for a new home, 
prompting them to leave their own marshes and deserts, and to possess 
themselves of this most fertile soil and of you its inhabitants. Liberty, 
indeed, and the like specious names are their pretexts; but never did any 
man seek to enslave his fellows and secure dominion for himself without 
using the very same words.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="74"><p>"<placeName key="1000070">Gaul</placeName> always had its petty kingdoms and intestine

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">CERIALIS' SPEECH AT <placeName key="tgn,7004451">TRIER</placeName></note>
wars, till you submitted to our authority. 
We, though so often provoked, have used the right of conquest to burden you 
only with the cost of maintaining peace. For the tranquillity of nations 
cannot be preserved without armies; armies cannot exist without pay; pay 
cannot be furnished without tribute; all else is common between us. You 
often command our legions. You rule these and other provinces. There is no 
privilege, no exclusion. From worthy Emperors you derive equal advantage, 
though you dwell so far away, while cruel rulers are most formidable to 
their neighbours. Endure the passions and rapacity of your masters, just as 
you bear barren seasons and excessive rains and other natural evils. There 
will be vices as long as there are men. But they are not perpetual, and they 
are compensated by the occurrence of better things. Perhaps, however, you 
expect a milder rule under Tutor and Classicus, and fancy that armies to 
repel the Germans and the Britons will be furnished by less tribute than you 
now pay. Should the Romans be driven out (which God forbid) what can result 
but wars between all these nations? By the prosperity and order of eight 
hundred years has this fabric of empire been consolidated, nor can it be 
overthrown without destroying those who overthrow it. Yours will be the 
worst peril, for you have gold and wealth, and these are the chief 
incentives to war. Give therefore your love and respect to the cause of 
peace, and to that capital in which we, conquerors and conquered, claim an 
equal right. Let the lessons of fortune in both its forms teach you not to 
prefer rebellion and ruin to submission and safety." With words to this 
effect he quieted and encouraged his audience, who feared harsher 
treatment.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="75"><p>The territory of the 
Treveri was occupied by the victorious army, when Civilis and Classicus sent 
letters to Cerialis, the purport of which was as follows: "Vespasian, though 
the news is suppressed, is dead. <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> are thoroughly wasted by intestine war. Mucianus 
and Domitian are mere empty and powerless names. If Cerialis wishes for the 
empire of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, we can be content with the 
boundaries of our own States. If he prefers to fight, we do not refuse that 
alternative." Cerialis sent no answer to Civilis and Classicus, but 
despatched the bearer and the letter itself

to Domitian. The 
enemy advanced from every quarter in several bodies. Cerialis was generally 
censured for allowing them to unite, when he might have destroyed them in 
detail. The Roman army surrounded their camp with a fosse and rampart, for 
up to that time they had been rash enough to occupy it without any defence. 
Among the Germans there was a conflict of opinions.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="76"><p>Civilis said: "We must await the arrival of the 
Transrhenane tribes, the terror of whose name will break down the shattered 
strength of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. As for the Gauls, what are they 
but the prey of the conqueror? And yet the chief strength of the nation, the 
Belg&aelig;, are with us, either openly, or in heart." Tutor maintained that 
the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> would only increase with delay, as 
her armies were assembling from all quarters. "One legion," he said, "has 
already been brought over from <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>; others have 
been summoned from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, or are advancing from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Nor are these troops newly raised levies, but 
they are veteran soldiers, experienced in war. But the Germans, whom we are 
expecting, do not obey orders, and cannot be controlled, but always act 
according to their own caprice. The money too and other presents by which 
alone they can be bribed are more plentiful among the Romans, and no one can 
be so bent on fighting as not to prefer repose to peril, when the profit is 
the same. But if we at once meet the foe, Cerialis has no legions but those 
that survive from the wreck of the German army, and these are bound by 
treaties to the States of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. And the very fact of 
their having, contrary to their expectations, lately routed the 
undisciplined force of Valentinus will confirm in their rashness both them 
and their general. They will venture again, and will find themselves in the 
hands, not of an ignorant stripling, whose thoughts were of speeches and 
harangues rather than of battle and the sword, but in those of Civilis and 
Classicus, whom when they once behold they will be reminded of panic, of 
flight, of famine, and of the many times when as captives they had to beg 
for life. Nor are the Treveri and Lingones bound by any ties of affection; 
once let their fear cease, and they will resume their arms." Classicus put 
an end to these dif-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">REBELS ATTACK 
ROMANS</note>
ferences of opinion by giving his approval to the suggestions 
of Tutor, which were at once acted on.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="77"><p>The centre was the post assigned to the Ubii and Lingones. On 
the right were the Batavian cohorts; on the left the Bructeri and the 
Tencteri. One division marching over the hills, another passing between the 
high road and the river <placeName key="tgn,7002972">Mosella</placeName>, made the attack 
with such suddenness, that Cerialis, who had not slept in the camp, was in 
his chamber and even in his bed, when he heard at the same moment that the 
battle had begun, and that his men were being worsted. He rebuked the alarm 
of the messengers, till the whole extent of the disaster became visible, and 
he saw that the camp of the legions had been forced, that the cavalry were 
routed, that the bridge over the <placeName key="tgn,7002972">Mosella</placeName>, which 
connected the further bank of the river with the Colony, was held by the 
Germans. Undismayed by the confusion, Cerialis held back the fugitives with 
his own hand, and readily exposing himself, with his person entirely 
unprotected, to the missiles of the enemy, he succeeded by a daring and 
successful effort, with the prompt aid of his bravest soldiers, in 
recovering the bridge and holding it with a picked force. Then returning to 
the camp, he saw the broken companies of the legions, which had been 
captured at <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName> and <placeName>Novesium</placeName>, with but few soldiers round the standards, and 
the eagles all but surrounded by the foe. Fired with indignation, he 
exclaimed, "It is not Flaccus or Vocula, whom you are thus abandoning. There 
is no treachery here; I have nothing to excuse but that I rashly believed 
that you, forgetting your alliance with <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, had 
again recollected your allegiance to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. I shall 
be added to the number of the Numisii and Herennii, so that all your 
commanders will have fallen by the hands of their soldiers or of the enemy. 
Go, tell Vespasian, or, since they are nearer, Civilis and Classicus, that 
you have deserted your general on the battlefield. Legions will come who 
will not leave me unavenged or you unpunished."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="78"><p>All this was true, and the tribunes and prefects heaped on their 
men the same reproaches. The troops formed themselves in cohorts and 
companies, for they could not deploy into line, as the enemy were scattered 
everywhere, while

from the fact that the battle was raging within 
the entrenchments, they were themselves hampered with their tents and 
baggage. Tutor, Classicus, and Civilis, each at his post, animated the 
combatants; the Gauls they urged to fight for freedom, the Batavi for glory, 
the Germans for plunder. Everything seemed in favour of the enemy, till the 
21st legion, having more room than the others, formed itself into a compact 
body, withstood, and soon drove back the assailants. Nor was it without an 
interposition of heaven, that by a sudden change of temper the conquerors 
turned their backs and fled. Their own account was, that they were alarmed 
by the sight of the cohorts, which, after being broken at the first onset, 
rallied on the top of the hills, and presented the appearance of 
reinforcements. What checked them in their course of victory was a 
mischievous struggle among themselves to secure plunder while they forgot 
the enemy. Cerialis, having thus all but ruined everything by his 
carelessness, restored the day by his resolution; following up his success, 
he took and destroyed the enemy's camp on the same day.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="79"><p>No long time was allowed to the soldiers for 
repose. The Agrippinenses were begging for help, and were offering to give 
up the wife and sister of Civilis and the daughter of Classicus, who had 
been left with them as pledges for the maintenance of the alliance. In the 
meanwhile they had massacred all the Germans who were scattered throughout 
their dwellings. Hence their alarm and reasonable importunity in begging for 
help, before the enemy, recovering their strength, could raise their spirits 
for a new effort or for thoughts of revenge. And indeed Civilis had marched 
in their direction, nor was he by any means weak, as he had still, in 
unbroken force, the most warlike of his cohorts, which consisted of Chauci 
and Frisii, and which was posted at <placeName key="tgn,7012785">Tolbiacum</placeName>, on 
the frontiers of the Agrippinenses. He was, however, diverted from his 
purpose by the deplorable news that this cohort had been entirely destroyed 
by a stratagem of the Agrippinenses, who, having stupefied the Germans by a 
profuse entertainment and abundance of wine, fastened the doors, set fire to 
the houses, and burned them. At the same time Cerialis advanced by forced 
marches, and re-

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">REBELS DEFEATED; <placeName key="tgn,7004446">COLOGNE</placeName> RELIEVED</note>
lieved the city. Civilis too was 
beset by other fears. He was afraid that the 14th legion, supported by the 
fleet from <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, might do mischief to the Batavi 
along their line of coast. The legion was, however, marched overland under 
the command of Fabius Priscus into the territory of the Nervii and Tungri, 
and these two states were allowed to capitulate. The Canninefates, taking 
the offensive, attacked our fleet, and the larger part of the ships was 
either sunk or captured. The same tribe also routed a crowd of Nervii, who 
by a spontaneous movement had taken up arms on the Roman side. Classicus 
also gained a victory over some cavalry, who had been sent on to <placeName>Novesium</placeName> by Cerialis. These reverses, which, though 
trifling, came in rapid succession, destroyed by degrees the prestige of the 
recent victory.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="80"><p>About the same time 
Mucianus ordered the son of Vitellius to be put to death, alleging that 
dissension would never cease, if he did not destroy all seeds of civil war. 
Nor would he suffer Antonius Primus to be taken into the number of 
Domitian's attendants, for he felt uneasy at his popularity with the troops, 
and feared the proud spirit of the man, who could not endure an equal, much 
less a superior, Antonius then went to Vespasian, who received him, not 
indeed as he expected, but in a not unfriendly spirit. Two opposite 
influences acted on the Emperor; on the one hand were the merits of 
Antonius, under whose conduct the war had beyond all doubt been terminated; 
on the other, were the letters of Mucianus. And everyone else inveighed 
against him, as an ill-affected and conceited man, nor did they forget the 
scandals of his early life. Antonius himself failed not to provoke offence 
by his arrogance and his excessive propensity to dwell on his own services. 
He reproached other men with being cowards; C&aelig;cina he stigmatized as a 
captive and a prisoner of war. Thus by degrees he came to be thought of less 
weight and worth, though his friendship with the Emperor to all appearance 
remained the same.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="81"><p>In the months 
during which Vespasian was waiting at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> for 
the periodical return of the summer gales and settled weather at sea, many 
wonders occurred which seemed to point him out as the object of the favour 
of heaven and of the partiality of the Gods. One of the com-

mon 
people of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, well-known for his blindness, 
threw himself at the Emperor's knees, and implored him with groans to heal 
his infirmity. This he did by the advice of the God Serapis, whom this 
nation, devoted as it is to many superstitions, worships more than any other 
divinity. He begged Vespasian that he would deign to moisten his cheeks and 
eye-balls with his spittle. Another with a diseased hand, at the counsel of 
the same God, prayed that the limb might feel the print of a C&aelig;sar's 
foot. At first Vespasian ridiculed and repulsed them. They persisted; and 
he, though on the one hand he feared the scandal of a fruitless attempt, 
yet, on the other, was induced by the entreaties of the men and by the 
language of his flatterers to hope for success. At last he ordered that the 
opinion of physicians should be taken, as to whether such blindness and 
infirmity were within the reach of human skill. They discussed the matter 
from different points of view. "In the one case," they said, "the faculty of 
sight was not wholly destroyed, and might return, if the obstacles were 
removed; in the other case, the limb, which had fallen into a diseased 
condition might be restored, if a healing influence were applied; such, 
perhaps, might be the pleasure of the Gods, and the Emperor might be chosen 
to be the minister of the divine will; at any rate, all the glory of a 
successful remedy would be C&aelig;sar's, while the ridicule of failure 
would fall on the sufferers." And so Vespasian, supposing that all things 
were possible to his good fortune, and that nothing was any longer past 
belief, with a joyful countenance, amid the intense expectation of the 
multitude of bystanders, accomplished what was required. The hand was 
instantly restored to its use, and the light of day again shone upon the 
blind. Persons actually present attest both facts, even now when nothing is 
to be gained by falsehood.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="82"><p>Vespasian 
thus came to conceive a deeper desire to visit the sanctuary of Serapis, 
that he might consult the God about the interests of his throne. He gave 
orders that all persons should be excluded from the temple. He had entered, 
and was absorbed in worship, when he saw behind him one of the chief men of 
 <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, named Basilides, whom he knew at the time to 
be detained by sickness at a consid-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">VESPASIAN AT 
<placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">ALEXANDRIA</placeName></note>
erable distance, as much as 
several days' journey, from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>. He enquired 
of the priests, whether Basilides had on this day entered the temple. He 
enquired of others whom he met, whether he had been seen in the city. At 
length, sending some horsemen, he ascertained that at that very instant the 
man had been eighty miles distant. He then concluded that it was a divine 
apparition, and discovered an oracular force in the name of 
Basilides.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="83"><p>The origin of this God 
Serapis has not hitherto been made generally known by our writers. The 
Egyptian priests give this account. While Ptolemy, the first Macedonian king 
who consolidated the power of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, was setting up 
in the newly-built city of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> 
fortifications, temples, and rites of worship, there appeared to him in his 
sleep a youth of singular beauty and more than human stature, who counselled 
the monarch to send his most trusty friends to <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, and fetch his effigy from that country. This, he 
said, would bring prosperity to the realm, and great and illustrious would 
be the city which gave it a reception. At the same moment he saw the youth 
ascend to heaven in a blaze of fire. Roused by so significant and strange an 
appearance, Ptolemy disclosed the vision of the night to the Egyptian 
priests, whose business it is to understand such matters. As they knew but 
little of <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> or of foreign countries, he 
enquired of Timotheus, an Athenian, one of the family of the Eumolpids, whom 
he had invited from <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> to preside over the 
sacred rites, what this worship was, and who was the deity. Timotheus, 
questioning persons who had found their way to <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, learnt that there was there a city <placeName key="perseus,Sinope">Sinope</placeName>, and near it a temple, which, according to an old 
tradition of the neighbourhood, was sacred to the infernal Jupiter, for 
there also stood close at hand a female figure, to which many gave the name 
of Proserpine. Ptolemy, however, with the true disposition of a despot, 
though prone to alarm, was, when the feeling of security returned, more 
intent on pleasures than on religious matters; and he began by degrees to 
neglect the affair, and to turn his thoughts to other concerns, till at 
length the same apparition, but now more terrible and peremptory, denounced 
ruin against the king and his realm, unless his bidding were performed.

Ptolemy then gave directions that an embassy should be despatched 
with presents to king Scydrothemis, who at that time ruled the people of <placeName key="perseus,Sinope">Sinope</placeName>, and instructed them, when they were on the point 
of sailing, to consult the Pythian Apollo. Their voyage was prosperous, and 
the response of the oracle was clear. The God bade them go and carry back 
with them the image of his father, but leave that of his sister 
behind.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="84"><p>On their arrival at <placeName key="perseus,Sinope">Sinope</placeName>, they delivered to Scydrothemis the presents from 
their king, with his request and message. He wavered in purpose, dreading at 
one moment the anger of the God, terrified at another by the threats and 
opposition of the people. Often he was wrought upon by the gifts and 
promises of the ambassadors. And so three years passed away, while Ptolemy 
did not cease to urge his zealous solicitations. He continued to increase 
the dignity of his embassies, the number of his ships, and the weight of his 
gold. A terrible vision then appeared to Scydrothemis, warning him to thwart 
no longer the purposes of the God. As he yet hesitated, various disasters, 
pestilence, and the unmistakeable anger of heaven, which grew heavier from 
day to day, continued to harass him. He summoned an assembly, and explained 
to them the bidding of the God, the visions of Ptolemy and himself, and the 
miseries that were gathering about them. The people turned away angrily from 
their king, were jealous of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and, fearing for 
themselves, thronged around the temple. The story becomes at this point more 
marvellous, and relates that the God of his own will conveyed himself on 
board the fleet, which had been brought close to shore, and, wonderful to 
say, vast as was the extent of sea that they traversed, they arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> on the third day. A temple, proportioned to 
the grandeur of the city, was erected in a place called <placeName>Rhacotis</placeName>, where there had stood a chapel consecrated in 
old times to Serapis and Isis. Such is the most popular account of the 
origin and introduction of the God Serapis. I am aware indeed that there are 
some who say that he was brought from <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>, a 
city of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, in the reign of Ptolemy III., while 
others assert that it was the act of the same king, but that the place from 
which he was brought was <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName>, once a famous 
city

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">FRUITLESS INTRIGUES OF DOMITIAN</note>
and 
the strength of ancient <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. The God himself, 
because he heals the sick, many identified with &AElig;sculapius; others 
with Osiris, the deity of the highest antiquity among these nations; not a 
few with Jupiter, as being supreme ruler of all things; but most people with 
Pluto, arguing from the emblems which may be seen on his statues, or from 
conjectures of their own.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="85"><p>Domitian 
and Mucianus received, before they reached the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, 
favourable news of the operations among the Treveri. The best proof of the 
victory was seen in the enemy's general Valentinus, who with undaunted 
courage shewed in his look his habitual high spirit. He was heard, but only 
that they might judge of his character; and he was condemned. During his 
execution he replied to one who taunted him with the subjection of his 
country, "That I take as my consolation in death." Mucianus now brought 
forward as a new thought a plan he had long concealed. "Since," he said, "by 
the blessing of the Gods the strength of the enemy has been broken, it would 
little become Domitian, now that the war is all but finished, to interfere 
with the glory of others. If the stability of the Empire or the safety of 
<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> were in danger, it would have been right for 
C&aelig;sar to take his place in the field; but the Canninefates and Batavi 
should be handed over to inferior generals. Let the Emperor display from the 
near neighbourhood of <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName> the might and 
prestige of imperial power, not meddling with trifling risks, though he 
would not be wanting on greater occasions."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="86"><p>His artifices were understood, but it was a part of their 
respect not to expose them. Thus they arrived at <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName>. It is believed that from this place Domitian 
despatched secret emissaries to Cerialis, and tempted his loyalty with the 
question whether, on his shewing himself, he would hand over to him the 
command of the army. Whether in this scheme Domitian was thinking of war 
with his father, or of collecting money and men to be used against his 
brother, was uncertain; for Cerialis, by a judicious temporising, eluded the 
request as prompted by an idle and childish ambition. Domitian, seeing that 
his youth was despised by the older officers, gave up even the less im-

portant functions of government which he had before exercised. Under 
a semblance of simple and modest tastes, he wrapped himself in a profound 
reserve, and affected a devotion to literature and a love of poetry, thus 
seeking to throw a veil over his character, and to withdraw himself from the 
jealousy of his brother, of whose milder temper, so unlike his own, he 
judged most falsely.</p></div2></div1>

<div1 type="book" n="5">
<head>BOOK V</head>
<head>A.D. <date value="70">70</date></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>EARLY in this year <persName>Titus</persName> C&aelig;sar, 
 who had been selected by his father to complete the subjugation of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>, and who had gained distinction as a soldier 
while both were still subjects, began to rise in power and reputation, as 
armies and provinces emulated each other in their attachment to him. The 
young man himself, anxious to be thought superior to his station, was ever 
displaying his gracefulness and his energy in war. By his courtesy and 
affability he called forth a willing obedience, and he often mixed with the 
common soldiers, while working or marching, without impairing his dignity as 
general. He found in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> three legions, the 
5th, the 10th, and the 15th, all old troops of Vespasian's. To these he 
added the 12th from <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and some men belonging to 
the 18th and 3rd, whom he had withdrawn from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>. This force was accompanied by twenty cohorts 
of allied troops and eight squadrons of cavalry, by the two kings Agrippa 
and Sohemus, by the auxiliary forces of king Antiochus, by a strong 
contingent of Arabs, who hated the Jews with the usual hatred of neighbours, 
and, lastly, by many persons brought from the capital and from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by private hopes of securing the yet unengaged 
affections of the Prince. With this force Titus entered the enemy's 
territory, preserving strict order on his march, reconnoitring every spot, 
and always ready to give battle. At last he encamped near <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Jerusalem</placeName>.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>As I am 
about to relate the last days of a famous city, it seems appropriate to 
throw some light on its origin. </p>
<p>Some say that the Jews were fugitives 
 from the island of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, who settled on the nearest 
 coast of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Africa</placeName> about the time when Saturn was 
driven from his throne by the power

of Jupiter. Evidence of this 
is sought in the name. There is a famous mountain in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> called <placeName>Ida</placeName>; the 
neighbouring tribe, the Id&aelig;i, came to be called Jud&aelig;i by a 
barbarous lengthening of the national name. Others assert that in the reign 
of Isis the overflowing population of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, led by 
Hierosolymus and Judas, discharged itself into the neighbouring countries. 
Many, again, say that they were a race of Ethiopian origin, who in the time 
of king Cepheus were driven by fear and hatred of their neighbours to seek a 
new dwelling-place. Others describe them as an Assyrian horde who, not 
having sufficient territory, took possession of part of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and founded cities of their own in what is called 
the Hebrew country, lying on the borders of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. 
Others, again, assign a very distinguished origin to the Jews, alleging that 
they were the Solymi, a nation celebrated in the poems of Homer, who called 
the city which they founded <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Hierosolyma</placeName> after their 
own name.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>Most writers, however, agree 
in stating that once a disease, which horribly disfigured the body, broke 
out over <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; that king Bocchoris, seeking a 
remedy, consulted the oracle of Hammon, and was bidden to cleanse his realm, 
and to convey into some foreign land this race detested by the gods. The 
people, who had been collected after diligent search, finding themselves 
left in a desert, sat for the most part in a stupor of grief, till one of 
the exiles, Moyses by name, warned them not to look for any relief from God 
or man, forsaken as they were of both, but to trust to themselves, taking 
for their heaven-sent leader that man who should first help them to be quit 
of their present misery. They agreed, and in utter ignorance began to 
advance at random. Nothing, however, distressed them so much as the scarcity 
of water, and they had sunk ready to perish in all directions over the 
plain, when a herd of wild asses was seen to retire from their pasture to a 
rock shaded by trees. Moyses followed them, and, guided by the appearance of 
a grassy spot, discovered an abundant spring of water. This furnished 
relief. After a continuous journey for six days, on the seventh they 
possessed themselves of a country, from which they expelled the inhabitants, 
and in which they founded a city and a temple.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">THEORIES OF JEWISH ORIGINS</note><p>Moyses, wishing to secure for the future his authority over the nation, gave 
them a novel form of worship, opposed to all that is practised by other men. 
Things sacred with us, with them have no sanctity, while they allow what 
with us is forbidden. In their holy place they have consecrated an image of 
the animal by whose guidance they found deliverance from their long and 
thirsty wanderings. They slay the ram, seemingly in derision of Hammon, and 
they sacrifice the ox, because the Egyptians worship it as Apis. They 
abstain from swine's flesh, in consideration of what they suffered when they 
were infected by the leprosy to which this animal is liable. By their 
frequent fasts they still bear witness to the long hunger of former days, 
and the Jewish bread, made without leaven, is retained as a memorial of 
their hurried seizure of corn. We are told that the rest of the seventh day 
was adopted, because this day brought with it a termination of their toils; 
after a while the charm of indolence beguiled them into giving up the 
seventh year also to inaction. But others say that it is an observance in 
honour of Saturn, either from the primitive elements of their faith having 
been transmitted from the Id&aelig;i, who are said to have shared the flight 
of that God, and to have founded the race, or from the circumstance that of 
the seven stars which rule the destinies of men Saturn moves in the highest 
orbit and with the mightiest power, and that many of the heavenly bodies 
complete their revolutions and courses in multiples of seven.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>This worship, however introduced, is upheld by its 
antiquity; all their other customs, which are at once perverse and 
disgusting, owe their strength to their very badness. The most degraded out 
of other races, scorning their national beliefs, brought to them their 
contributions and presents. This augmented the wealth of the Jews, as also 
did the fact, that among themselves they are inflexibly honest and ever 
ready to shew compassion, though they regard the rest of mankind with all 
the hatred of enemies. They sit apart at meals, they sleep apart, and 
though, as a nation, they are singularly prone to lust, they abstain from 
intercourse with foreign women; among themselves nothing is unlawful. 
Circumcision was adopted by them as a mark of difference

from 
other men. Those who come over to their religion adopt the practice, and 
have this lesson first instilled into them, to despise all gods, to disown 
their country, and set at nought parents, children, and brethren. Still they 
provide for the increase of their numbers. It is a crime among them to kill 
any newly-born infant. They hold that the souls of all who perish in battle 
or by the hands of the executioner are immortal. Hence a passion for 
propagating their race and a contempt for death. They are wont to bury 
rather than to burn their dead, following in this the Egyptian custom; they 
bestow the same care on the dead, and they hold the same belief about the 
lower world. Quite different is their faith about things divine. The 
Egyptians worship many animals and images of monstrous form; the Jews have 
purely mental conceptions of Deity, as one in essence. They call those 
profane who make representations of God in human shape out of perishable 
materials. They believe that Being to be supreme and eternal, neither 
capable of representation, nor of decay. They therefore do not allow any 
images to stand in their cities, much less in their temples. This flattery 
is not paid to their kings, nor this honour to our Emperors. From the fact, 
however, that their priests used to chant to the music of flutes and 
cymbals, and to wear garlands of ivy, and that a golden vine was found in 
the temple, some have thought that they worshipped Father Liber, the 
conqueror of the East, though their institutions do not by any means 
harmonize with the theory; for Liber established a festive and cheerful 
worship, while the Jewish religion is tasteless and mean.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>Eastward the country is bounded by <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>; to the south lies <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>;

The palm-groves are tall and graceful. The balsam is a shrub; each branch,

  <note anchored="yes" place="marg">CHARACTER OF <placeName key="tgn,7001407">JUD&AElig;A</placeName></note>
amidst 
these burning heats, a summit shaded with trees and never deserted by its 
snows. The same range supplies and sends forth the stream of the <placeName key="tgn,1125225">Jordan</placeName>. This river does not discharge itself into the 
sea, but flows entire through two lakes, and is lost in the third. This is a 
lake of vast circumference; it resembles the sea, but is more nauseous in 
taste; it breeds pestilence among those who live near by its noisome odour; 
it cannot be moved by the wind, and it affords no home either to fish or 
water-birds. These strange waters support what is thrown upon them, as on a 
solid surface, and all persons, whether they can swim or no, are equally 
buoyed up by the waves. At a certain season of the year the lake throws up 
bitumen, and the method of collecting it has been taught by that experience 
which teaches all other arts. It is naturally a fluid of dark colour; when 
vinegar is sprinkled upon it, it coagulates and floats upon the surface. 
Those whose business it is take it with the hand, and draw it on to the deck 
of the boat; it then continues of itself to flow in and lade the vessel till 
the stream is cut off. Nor can this be done by any instrument of brass or 
iron. It shrinks from blood or any cloth stained by the menstrua of women. 
Such is the account of old authors; but those who know the country say that 
the bitumen moves in heaving masses on the water, that it is drawn by hand 
to the shore, and that there, when dried by the evaporation of the earth and 
the power of the sun, it is cut into pieces with axes and wedges just as 
timber or stone would be.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>Not far from 
this lake lies a plain, once fertile, they say, and the site of great 
cities, but afterwards struck by lightning and consumed. Of this event, they 
declare, traces still remain, for the soil, which is scorched in appearance, 
has lost its productive power. Everything that grows spontaneously, as well 
as what is planted by hand, either when the leaf or flower have been 
developed, or after maturing in the usual form, becomes black and rotten, 
and crumbles into a kind of dust. I am ready to allow, on the one hand, that 
cities, once famous, may have been consumed by fire from heaven, while, on 
the other, I imagine that the earth is infected by the exhalations of the 
lake, that the surrounding air is tainted, and that thus the growth of 
harvest and the

fruits of autumn decay under the equally noxious 
influences of soil and climate. The river <placeName>Belus</placeName> also 
flows into the Jewish sea. About its mouth is a kind of sand which is 
collected, mixed with nitre, and fused into glass. This shore is of limited 
extent, but furnishes an inexhaustible supply to the exporter.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>A great part of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> 
  consists of scattered villages. They have also towns. <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Jerusalem</placeName> is the capital. There stood a temple of 
immense wealth. First came the city with its fortifications, then the royal 
palace, then, within the innermost defences, the temple itself. Only the Jew 
might approach the gates; all but priests were forbidden to pass the 
threshold. While the East was under the sway of the Assyrians, the Medes, 
and the Persians, Jews were the most contemptible of the subject tribes. 
When the Macedonians became supreme, King Antiochus strove to destroy the 
national superstition, and to introduce Greek civilization, but was 
prevented by his war with the Parthians from at all improving this vilest of 
nations; for at this time the revolt of Arsaces had taken place. The 
Macedonian power was now weak, while the Parthian had not yet reached its 
full strength, and, as the Romans were still far off, the Jews chose kings 
for themselves. Expelled by the fickle populace, and regaining their throne 
by force of arms, these princes, while they ventured on the wholesale 
banishment of their subjects, on the destruction of cities, on the murder of 
brothers, wives, and parents, and the other usual atrocities of despots, 
fostered the national superstition by appropriating the dignity of the 
priesthood as the support of their political power.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>Cneius Pompeius was the first of our countrymen to 
subdue the Jews. Availing himself of the right of conquest, he entered the 
temple. Thus it became commonly known that the place stood empty with no 
similitude of gods within, and that the shrine had nothing to reveal. The 
walls of <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Jerusalem</placeName> were destroyed, the temple was 
left standing. After these provinces had fallen, in the course of our civil 
wars, into the hands of Marcus Antonius, Pacorus, king of the Parthians, 
seized <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>. He was slain by Publius 
 Ventidius, and the Parthians were driven back over the <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName>.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">JEWISH HISTORY 
UNTIL VESPASIAN</note>
Caius Sosius reduced the Jews to subjection. The 
royal power, which had been bestowed by Antony on Herod, was augmented by 
the victorious Augustus. On Herod's death, one Simon, without waiting for 
the approbation of the Emperor, usurped the title of king. He was punished 
by Quintilius Varus then governor of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and the 
nation, with its liberties curtailed, was divided into three provinces under 
the sons of Herod. Under Tiberius all was quiet. But when the Jews were 
ordered by Caligula to set up his statue in the temple, they preferred the 
alternative of war. The death of the Emperor put an end to the disturbance. 
The kings were either dead, or reduced to insignificance, when Claudius 
entrusted the province of <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName> to the Roman 
Knights or to his own freedmen, one of whom, Antonius Felix, indulging in 
every kind of barbarity and lust, exercised the power of a king in the 
spirit of a slave. He had married Drusilla, the granddaughter of Antony and 
Cleopatra, and so was the grandson-in-law, as Claudius was the grandson, of 
Antony.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="10"><p>Yet the endurance of the Jews 
lasted till Gessiua Florus was procurator. In his time the war broke out. 
Cestius Gallus, legate of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, who attempted to 
crush it, had to fight several battles, generally with ill-success. Cestius 
dying, either in the course of nature, or from vexation, Vespasian was sent 
by Nero, and by help of his good fortune, his high reputation, and his 
excellent subordinates, succeeded within the space of two summers in 
occupying with his victorious army the whole of the level country and all 
the cities, except <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Jerusalem</placeName>. The following year had 
been wholly taken up with civil strife, and had passed, as far as the Jews 
were concerned, in inaction. Peace having been established in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, foreign affairs were once more remembered. Our 
indignation was heightened by the circumstance that the Jews alone had not 
submitted. At the same time it was held to be more expedient, in reference 
to the possible results and contingencies of the new reign, that Titus 
should remain with the army. </p>
<p>Accordingly he pitched his camp, as I have 
 related, before the walls of <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Jerusalem</placeName>, and 
displayed his legions in order of battle.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="11"><p>The Jews formed their line close under their walls

whence, if successful, they might venture to advance, and where, if 
repulsed, they had a refuge at hand. The cavalry with some light infantry 
was sent to attack them, and fought without any decisive result. Shortly 
afterwards the enemy retreated. During the following days they fought a 
series of engagements in front of the gates, till they were driven within 
the walls by continual defeats. The Romans then began to prepare for an 
assault. It seemed beneath them to await the result of famine. The army 
demanded the more perilous alternative, some prompted by courage, many by 
sheer ferocity and greed of gain. Titus himself had <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with all its wealth and pleasures before his eyes. 
 <placeName key="tgn,1000953">Jerusalem</placeName> must fall at once, or it would delay his 
enjoyment of them. But the commanding situation of the city had been 
strengthened by enormous works which would have been a thorough defence even 
for level ground. Two hills of great height were fenced in by walls which 
had been skilfully obliqued or bent inwards, in such a manner that the flank 
of an assailant was exposed to missiles. The rock terminated in a precipice; 
the towers were raised to a height of sixty feet, where the hill lent its 
aid to the fortifications, where the ground fell, to a height of one hundred 
and twenty. They had a marvellous appearance, and to a distant spectator 
seemed to be of uniform elevation. Within were other walls surrounding the 
palace, and, rising to a conspicuous height, the tower Antonia, so called by 
Herod, in honour of Marcus Antonius.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>The temple resembled a citadel, and had its own walls, which were more 
laboriously constructed than the others. Even the colonnades with which it 
was surrounded formed an admirable outwork. It contained an inexhaustible 
spring; there were subterranean excavations in the hill, and tanks and 
cisterns for holding rain water. The founders of the state had foreseen that 
frequent wars would result from the singularity of its customs, and so had 
made every provision against the most protracted siege. After the capture of 
their city by Pompey, experience and apprehension taught them much. Availing 
themselves of the sordid policy of the Claudian era to purchase the right of 
fortification, they raised in time of peace such walls as were suited for 
war. Their num-

 <note anchored="yes" place="marg">FORTIFICATIONS OF <placeName key="tgn,1000953">JERUSALEM</placeName></note>
bers were increased by a vast rabble 
collected from the overthrow of the other cities. All the most obstinate 
rebels had escaped into the place, and perpetual seditions were the 
consequence. There were three generals, and as many armies. Simon held the 
outer and larger circuit of walls. John, also called Bargioras, occupied the 
middle city. Eleazar had fortified the temple. John and Simon were strong in 
numbers and equipment, Eleazar in position. There were continual skirmishes, 
surprises, and incendiary fires, and a vast quantity of corn was burnt. 
Before long John sent some emissaries, who, under pretence of sacrificing, 
slaughtered Eleazar and his partisans, and gained possession of the temple. 
The city was thus divided between two factions, till, as the Romans 
approached, war with the foreigner brought about a reconciliation.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>Prodigies had occurred, which this nation, 
prone to superstition, but hating all religious rites, did not deem it 
lawful to expiate by offering and sacrifice. There had been seen hosts 
joining battle in the skies, the fiery gleam of arms, the temple illuminated 
by a sudden radiance from the clouds. The doors of the inner shrine were 
suddenly thrown open, and a voice of more than mortal tone was heard to cry 
that the Gods were departing. At the same instant there was a mighty stir as 
of departure. Some few put a fearful meaning on these events, but in most 
there was a firm persuasion, that in the ancient records of their priests 
was contained a prediction of how at this very time the East was to grow 
powerful, and rulers, coming from <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Jud&aelig;a</placeName>, were 
to acquire universal empire. These mysterious prophecies had pointed to 
Vespasian and Titus, but the common people, with the usual blindness of 
ambition, had interpreted these mighty destinies of themselves, and could 
not be brought even by disasters to believe the truth. I have heard that the 
total number of the besieged, of every age and both sexes, amounted to six 
hundred thousand. All who were able bore arms, and a number, more than 
proportionate to the population, had the courage to do so. Men and women 
showed equal resolution, and life seemed more terrible than death, if they 
were to be forced to leave their country. Such was this city and nation; and 
Titus C&aelig;sar, seeing that the posi-

tion forbad an assault 
or any of the more rapid operations of war, determined to proceed by 
earthworks and covered approaches. The legions had their respective duties 
assigned to them, and there was a cessation from fighting, till all the 
inventions, used in ancient warfare, or devised by modern ingenuity for the 
reduction of cities, were constructed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>Meanwhile Civilis, having recruited his army from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> after his defeat among the Treveri, took up his 
position at the Old Camp, where his situation would protect him, and where 
the courage of his barbarian troops would be raised by the recollection of 
successes gained on the spot. He was followed to this place by Cerialis, 
whose forces had now been doubled by the arrival of the 2nd, 6th, and 14th 
legions. The auxiliary infantry and cavalry, summoned long before, had 
hastened to join him after his victory. Neither of the generals loved delay. 
But a wide extent of plain naturally saturated with water kept them apart. 
Civilis had also thrown a dam obliquely across the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, so that the stream, diverted by the obstacle, 
might overflow the adjacent country. Such was the character of the district, 
full of hidden perils from the varying depth of the fords, and unfavourable 
to our troops. The Roman soldier is heavily armed and afraid to swim, while 
the German, who is accustomed to rivers, is favoured by the lightness of his 
equipment and the height of his stature.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>The Batavi provoking a conflict, the struggle was at once begun 
by all the boldest spirits among our troops, but a panic arose, when they 
saw arms and horses swallowed up in the vast depths of the marshes. The 
Germans leapt lightly through the well-known shallows, and frequently, 
quitting the front, hung on the rear and flanks of our army. It was neither 
the close nor the distant fighting of a land-battle; it was more like a 
naval contest. Struggling among the waters, or exerting every limb where 
they found any firm footing, the wounded and the unhurt, those who could 
swim and those who could not, were involved in one common destruction. The 
loss however was less than might have been expected from the confusion, for 
the Germans, not venturing to leave the morass, returned to their camp. The 
result of this battle roused both generals, though from different mo-

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">CIVILIS ACTIVE IN <placeName key="tgn,7000084">GERMANY</placeName></note>
tives, to hasten on the final struggle. 
Civilis was anxious to follow up his success; Cerialis to wipe out his 
disgrace. The Germans were flushed with success; the Romans were thoroughly 
roused by shame. The barbarians spent the night in singing and shouting; our 
men in rage and threats of vengeance.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="16"><p>Next morning Cerialis formed his front with the cavalry and auxiliary 
infantry; in the second line were posted the legions, the general reserving 
a picked force for unforeseen contingencies. Civilis confronted him with his 
troops ranged, not in line, but in columns. On the right were the Batavi and 
the Gugerni; the left, which was nearer the river, was occupied by the 
Transrhenane tribes. The exhortations of the generals were not addressed as 
formal harangues to the assembled armies, but to the divisions separately, 
as they rode along the line. Cerialis spoke of the old glory of the Roman 
name, of former and of recent victories; he told them that in destroying for 
ever their treacherous, cowardly, and beaten foe, they had to execute a 
punishment, rather than to fight a battle. They had lately contended with a 
superior force, and yet the Germans, the strength of the hostile army, had 
been routed; a few were left, who carried terror in their hearts and scars 
upon their backs. He addressed to the several legions appropriate appeals. 
The 14th were styled the 'Conquerors of <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>'; 
the powerful influence of the 6th had made Galba Emperor; the men of the 2nd 
were in that battle first to consecrate their new standards and new eagle. 
Then riding up to the army of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, he stretched 
forth his hand, and implored them to recover their river-bank and their camp 
by the slaughter of the foe. A joyful shout arose from the whole army, some 
of whom after long peace lusted for battle, while others, weary of war, 
desired peace; all were looking for rewards and for future repose.</p></div2> 

<div2 type="chapter" n="17"><p>Nor did Civilis marshal his army in silence. 
He called the field of battle to bear witness to their valour. He told the 
Germans and Batavians that they were standing on the monuments of their 
glory, that they were treading under foot the ashes and bones of legions. 
"Wherever," he said, "the Roman turns his eyes, captivity, disaster, and 
everything that is terrible, confront him. Do not be alarmed by the

adverse result of the battle among the Treveri. There, their own 
success proved hurtful to the Germans, for, throwing away their arms, they 
hampered their hands with plunder. Since then everything has been favourable 
to us, and against the foe. All precautions, which the skill of a general 
should take, have been taken. Here are these flooded plains which we know so 
well, here the marshes so fatal to the enemy. The <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> and the Gods of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> 
are in your sight. Under their auspices give battle, remembering your wives, 
your parents, and your father-land. This day will either be the most 
glorious among the deeds of the past, or will be infamous in the eyes of 
posterity." These words were hailed, according to their custom, with the 
clash of arms and with wild antics, and then the battle was commenced by a 
discharge of stones, leaden balls, and other missiles, our soldiers not 
entering the morass, while the Germans sought to provoke, and so draw them 
on.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p>When their store of missiles was 
spent, and the battle grew hotter, a fiercer onslaught was made by the 
enemy. Their tall stature and very long spears enabled them, without 
closing, to wound our men, who were wavering and unsteady. At the same time 
a column of the Bructeri swam across from the dam, which I have described as 
carried out into the river. Here there was some confusion. The line of the 
allied infantry was being driven back, when the legions took up the contest. 
The fury of the enemy was checked, and the battle again became equal. At the 
same time a Batavian deserter came up to Cerialis, offering an opportunity 
of attacking the enemy's rear, if some cavalry were sent along the edge of 
the morass. The ground there was firm, and the Gugerni, to whom the post had 
been allotted, were careless. Two squadrons were sent with the deserter, and 
outflanked the unsuspecting enemy. At the shout that announced this success, 
the legions charged in front. The Germans were routed, and fled towards the 
 <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>. The war would have been finished that day, if 
the fleet had hastened to come up. As it was, the cavalry did not pursue, 
for a storm of rain suddenly fell, and night was at hand.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="19"><p>The next day the 14th legion was sent into the 
Upper Province to join Gallus Annius. The 10th, which had arrived

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">GERMANS ROUTED; CIVILIS PERSISTS</note>
from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, supplied its place in the army of Cerialis. 
Civilis was joined by some auxiliaries from the Chauci. Nevertheless he did 
not venture to fight for the defence of the Batavian capital, but carrying 
off property that could be removed, and setting fire to the remainder, he 
retreated into the island, aware that there were not vessels enough for 
constructing a bridge, and that the Roman army could not cross the river in 
any other way. He also demolished the dyke, constructed by Drusus 
Germanicus, and, by destroying this barrier, sent the river flowing down a 
steep channel on the side of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. The river having 
been thus, so to speak, diverted, the narrowness of the channel between the 
island and <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> created an appearance of an 
uninterrupted surface of dry ground. Tutor, Classicus, and one hundred and 
thirteen senators of the Treveri, also crossed the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>. Among them was Alpinius Montanus, of whose 
mission into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> by Antonius I have already spoken. 
He was accompanied by his brother Decimus Alpinius. His other adherents were 
now endeavouring to collect auxiliaries among these danger-loving tribes by 
appeals to their pity and their greed.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="20"><p>The war was so far from being at an end, that Civilis in one day 
attacked on four points the positions of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry 
and of the legions, assailing the tenth legion at <placeName key="tgn,7006876">Arenacum</placeName>, the second at <placeName>Batavodurum</placeName>, and the camp of the auxiliary infantry and 
cavalry at <placeName>Grinnes</placeName> and <placeName>Vada</placeName>, 
and so dividing his forces, that he himself, his sister's son Verax, 
Classicus, and Tutor, led each his own division. They were not confident of 
accomplishing all these objects, but they hoped that, if they made many 
ventures, fortune would favour them on some one point. Besides, Cerialis was 
not cautious, and might easily be intercepted, as the multiplicity of 
tidings hurried him from place to place. The force, which had to attack the 
tenth legion, thinking it a hard matter to storm a legionary encampment, 
surprised some troops, who had gone out, and were busy felling timber, 
killed the prefect of the camp, five centurions of the first rank, and a few 
soldiers; the rest found shelter behind the fortifications. At <placeName>Batavodurum</placeName> the German troops tried to break down the 
bridge partly built. Night terminated an indecisive conflict.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>There was greater danger at <placeName>Grinnes</placeName> and <placeName>Vada</placeName>. Civilis 
attacked <placeName>Vada</placeName>, Classicus <placeName>Grinnes</placeName>, and they could not be checked, for our bravest 
men had fallen, among them Briganticus, who commanded a squadron of cavalry, 
and of whose loyalty to the Roman cause and enmity to his uncle Civilis I 
have already spoken. But when Cerialis came up with a picked body of 
cavalry, the fortune of the day changed, and the Germans were driven 
headlong into the river. Civilis, who was recognised while seeking to stop 
his flying troops, became the mark of many missiles, left his horse, and 
swam across the river. Verax escaped in the same way. Some light vessels 
were brought up, and carried off Tutor and Classicus. Even on this occasion 
the Roman fleet was not present at the engagement, though orders had been 
given to that effect. Fear kept them away, and their crews were dispersed 
about other military duties. Cerialis in fact allowed too little time for 
executing his commands; he was hasty in his plans, though eminently 
successful in their results. Fortune helped him even where skill had failed, 
and so both the general and his army became less careful about discipline. A 
few days after this he escaped the peril of actual capture, but not without 
great disgrace.</p></div2> 
 <div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>He had gone to <placeName>Novesium</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7005090">Bonna</placeName>, to inspect 
the camps which were then in course of erection for the winter abode of the 
legions, and was making his way back with the fleet, his escort being in 
disorder, and his sentries negligent. This was observed by the Germans, and 
they planned a surprise. They chose a dark and cloudy night, and moving 
rapidly down the stream, entered the entrenchments without opposition. The 
carnage was at first helped on by a cunning device. They cut the ropes of 
the tents, and slaughtered the soldiers as they lay buried beneath their own 
dwellings. Another force put the fleet into confusion, threw their grappling 
irons on the vessels, and dragged them away by the sterns. They sought at 
first to elude notice by silence, but when the slaughter was begun, by way 
of increasing the panic they raised on all sides a deafening shout. The 
Romans, awakened by wounds, looked for their arms and rushed through the 
passages of the camp, some few with their proper accoutrements, but most 
with their garments

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">ROMAN SUCCESS AND 
FAILURE</note>
wrapped round their shoulders, and with drawn swords in their 
hands. The general, who was half asleep, and all but naked, was saved by the 
enemy's mistake. They carried off the pr&aelig;torian vessel, which was 
distinguished by a flag, believing that the general was on board. Cerialis 
indeed had passed the night elsewhere, in the company, as many believed, of 
an Ubian woman, Claudia Sacrata. The sentinels sought to excuse their own 
scandalous neglect by the disgraceful conduct of the general, alleging that 
they had been ordered to be silent, that they might not disturb his rest, 
and that, from omitting the watchwords and the usual challenges, they had 
themselves fallen asleep. The enemy rowed back in broad daylight with the 
captured vessels. The pr&aelig;torian trireme they towed up the river <placeName key="tgn,1126136">Lupia</placeName> as a present to Veleda.</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>Civilis was seized by a desire to make a naval demonstration. He 
manned all the biremes that he had, and such vessels as were propelled by a 
single bank of oars. To these he added a vast number of boats. He put in 
each three or four hundred men, the usual complement of a Liburnian galley. 
With these were the captured vessels, in which, picturesquely enough, plaids 
of various colours were used for sails. The place selected was an expanse of 
water, not unlike the sea, where the mouth of the <placeName>Mosa</placeName> serves to discharge the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> into the ocean. The motive for equipping this 
fleet was, to say nothing of the natural vanity of this people, a desire to 
intercept, by this alarming demonstration, the supplies that were 
approaching from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. Cerialis, more in 
astonishment than alarm, drew up his fleet in line, and, though inferior in 
numbers, it had the advantage in the experience of the crews, the skill of 
the pilots, and the size of the vessels. The Romans had the stream with 
them, the enemy's vessels were propelled by the wind. Thus passing each 
other, they separated after a brief discharge of light missiles. Civilis 
attempted nothing more, and retired to the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>. Cerialis mercilessly ravaged the <placeName>Island of the Batavi</placeName>, but, with a policy familiar to 
commanders, left untouched the estates and houses of Civilis. Meanwhile, 
however, the autumn was far advanced, and the river, swollen by the 
continual rains of the season, overflowed the island, marshy and low-lying 
as it is, till it resembled a lake. There

were no ships, no 
provisions at hand, and the camp, which was situated on low ground, was in 
process of being carried away by the force of the stream.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>That the legions might then have been crushed, and 
that the Germans wished to crush them, but were turned from their purpose by 
his own craft, was claimed as a merit by Civilis; nor is it unlike the 
truth, since a capitulation followed in a few days. Cerialis, sending secret 
emissaries, had held out the prospect of peace to the Batavi, and of pardon 
to Civilis, while he advised Veleda and her relatives to change by a 
well-timed service to the Roman people the fortune of war, which so many 
disasters had shown to be adverse. He reminded them that the Treveri had 
been beaten, that the Ubii had submitted, that the Batavi had had their 
country taken from them, and that from the friendship of Civilis nothing 
else had been gained but wounds, defeat, and mourning; an exile and a 
fugitive he could only be a burden to those who entertained him, and they 
had already trespassed enough in crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> 
so often. If they attempted anything more, on their side would be the wrong 
and the guilt, with the Romans the vengeance of heaven.</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="25"><p>Thus promises were mingled with threats. When the 
fidelity of the Transrhenane tribes had been thus shaken, among the Batavi 
also there arose debates. "We can no longer," they said, "postpone our ruin. 
The servitude of the whole world cannot be averted by a single nation. What 
has been accomplished by destroying legions with fire and sword, but that 
more legions and stronger have been brought up? If it was for Vespasian that 
we fought this war, then Vespasian rules the world; if we meant to challenge 
to battle the Roman people, then what a mere fraction of the human race are 
the Batavi! Look at the Rh&aelig;tians and Noricans, at the burdens borne by 
the other allies. No tribute, but valour and manhood are demanded of us. 
This is the next thing to liberty, and if we must choose between masters, 
then we may more honourably bear with the Emperors of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, than with the women of the Germans." Such were the 
murmurs of the lower class; the nobles spoke in fiercer language. "We have 
been driven into war," they said, "by the fury of Civilis. He sought to 
counterbalance his private wrongs by the

destruction of his nation. Then were the Gods angry with 
the Batavi when the legions were besieged, when the legates were slain, when 
the war, so necessary to that one man, so fatal to us, was begun. We are at 
the last extremity, unless we think of repenting, and avow our repentance by 
punishing the guilty."</p></div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>These 
dispositions did not escape the notice of Civilis. He determined to 
anticipate them, moved not only by weariness of his sufferings, but also by 
that clinging to life which often breaks the noblest spirits. He asked for a 
conference. The bridge over the river <placeName>Nabalia</placeName> was 
cut down, and the two generals advanced to the broken extremities. Civilis 
thus opened the conference:&mdash;"If it were before a legate of Vitellius 
that I were defending myself, my acts would deserve no pardon, my words no 
credit. All the relations between us were those of hatred and hostility, 
first made so by him, and afterwards embittered by me. My respect for 
Vespasian is of long standing. While he was still a subject, we were called 
friends. This was known to Primus Antonius, whose letters urged me to take 
up arms, for he feared lest the legions of <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> 
and the youth of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> should cross the Alps. What Antonius advised by his letters, Hordeonius 
 suggested by word of mouth. I fought the same battle in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, as did Mucianus in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, Aponius in <placeName key="tgn,7016746">M&oelig;sia</placeName>, 
 Flavianus in <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>."
