   <head>THE SUBJECT</head> 
   <p>PLIEUSICLES, a young Athenian, is in love with Philocomasium, a Courtesan of Athens, who returns his affection. Being sent on public business to <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, a certain Captain of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, Pyrgopolinices by name, comes to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and insinuates himself into the good graces of her mother, in order that he may get Philocomasium into his power. Having deceived the mother, he places the daughter on board ship and carries her off to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. On this, Palaestrio, a faithful servant of Pleusicles, hastens to embark for <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, with the view of telling his master what has happened. The ship being taken by pirates, he is made captive, and by chance is presented as a gift to Pyrgopolinices. He recognises the mistress of Pleusicles in the Captain’s house; but he carefully conceals from the Captain who he himself is. He then privately writes to Pleusicles, requesting him to come to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. On arriving, Pleusicles is hospitably entertained by Periplecomenus, a friend of his father, an old gentleman who lives next door to the Captain. As Philocomasium has a private room of her own in the Captain’s house, a hole is made through the partition wall, and by this contrivance she meets Pleusicles in the house of his entertainer, who gives his sanction to the plan.</p> <p>At this juncture, the play begins. A servant of the Captain, named Sceledrus, has been appointed to be the keeper of Philocomnasium. Pursuing a monkey along the roof of the house, he looks down the skylight of the house next door, and there sees Pleusicles and Philocomasium conversing and toying with each other. When this has been discovered to be the case, a plan is arranged, by which Sceledrus shall not only not divulge to the Captain what he has seen, but shall even be made to believe that he has not actually seen it himself. Palaestrio, therefore, persuades him that the twin-sister of Philocomasium has arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, and with her lover is staying at their neighbour’s house. To forward their designs, Palaestrio then invents another plan. He persuades the Captain to believe that the wife of his neighbour, Periplecomenus, is in love with him. Through his agency, a Courtesan, named Acroteleutium, pretends that she is the wife so desperately in love with the Captain. he believes this story, and, that he may the more conveniently receive her in his house, by the advice of Palaestrio, he sends Philocomasium away, and gives her into the charge of Pleusicles, who is disguised in the dress of a master of a ship. They go to the harbour and set sail, accompanied by Palaestrio, whom the Captain has given to Philocomasium at her request. The Captain, then, at the invitation of the maid of Acroteleutium, goes to the house next door, to visit her mistress. On this, Periplecomenus, with his servants, sallies forth upon him, and, having first threatened to cut him in pieces, and then having beaten and stripped him, they let him go, after they have exacted from him a confession that he has been rightly served, and a promise that he will molest no one in return for the treatment he has received. </p> </div> 

<div type="textpart" subtype="argument"> <head>THE ACROSTIC ARGUMENT. <note anchored="true" place="inline">[Supposed to have been written by Priscian, the Grammarian.]</note></head> <p>A Captain carries off to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> a Courtesan (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Meretricem</foreign>) from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. While his servant is intending to tell this (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Id</foreign>) to his master, her lover, who is an Ambassador (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Legato</foreign>) abroad, he himself is captured at sea, and (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Et</foreign>) is given as a present to the same Captain. The servant sends for his (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Suum</foreign>) master from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and cleverly makes a hole in the party wall, common to the two (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Geminis</foreign>) houses, that it may be possible (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Liceret</foreign>) for the two lovers secretly to meet. Wandering about <foreign xml:lang="lat">(Oberrans),</foreign> her keeper sees them from the tiles, but he is played a trick (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Ridiculis</foreign>) upon, as though it were another person. Palaestrio, too, as well (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Item</foreign>) persuades the Captain to have his mistress dismissed (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Omissam</foreign>), since the wife of the old man (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Senis</foreign>), his neighbour, wishes to marry him. He begs that she will go away of her own accord (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Ultro</foreign>), and gives her many things. He, himself, caught in the house of the old man (<foreign xml:lang="lat">Senis</foreign>), receives punishment as an adulterer. </p> </div> </div>

There was a raised margin to each leaf of the tablet, for the purpose of preventing the wax of the one from rubbing against the other.

It is not known who was the Greek author from whom Plautus took this play, which is one of his best.</note>, in Greek, of this Comedy; the same we call in Latin, <q type="emph">the Braggart</q> (Gloriosus). This city is <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>; then, the Captain, my master, who has gone off hence to the Forum, a bragging, impudent, stinking fellow, brimful of lying and lasciviousness, says that all the women are following him of their own accord. Wherever he goes, he is the laughing.stock of all; and so, the Courtesans here—since they make wry mouths at him, you may see the greater part of them with lips all awry. I wish you now to know this, how I came to be his slave, from him to whom I was servant before; for ’tis not long that I lave been in slavery to him. Give your attention, for now I will begin the argument. A very worthy young man at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was my master. He was in love with a Courtesan, brought up at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and she on the other hand loved him; such affection is most worthy to be cherished. In the public service, he was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> <milestone n="102" unit="line"/> <note anchored="true"><q type="mentioned" rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> </q>: This was a city situated on the sea-coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>.</note> as Ambassador on behalf of that mighty republic. In the mean time, by chance, this Captain came to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. He introduced himself to this lady of my master, began to cajole her mother with presents of wine, trinkets, and costly treats; and so the Captain made himself on intimate terms with the procuress. As soon as ever an opportunity was presented for this Captain, he tricked this procuress, the mother of the damsel, whom my master loved. For, unknown to her mother, he put the daughter on board ship, and carried this woman, against her will, hither to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. Soon as I knew that the lady of my master was carried off from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as quickly as ever I was able, I procured for myself a ship: I embarked, that I might carry tidings of this matter to my master at Naupactum. When we had got out to sea, some pirates, as they had hoped to do, took that ship on board of which I was; thus I was undone before I reached my master, for whom I had commenced to proceed on my voyage. <milestone n="120" unit="line"/>He that took me, gave me as a present to this same Captain. After he had taken me home to his own house, I saw there that favorite of my master who lived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. When, on the other hand, she perceived me, she gave me a sign with her eyes not to address her by name. Afterwards, when there was an opportunity, the damsel complained to me of her hard fate. She said that she wished to escape to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> from this house, that she was attached to him, that master of mine who lived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and that she had never hated any one more thoroughly than this same Captain. As I discovered the feelings of the damsel, I took tablets, sealed them in private, and gave them to a certain merchant to carry to him (my master, I mean, who was at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and who had so loved her), in order that he might come hither. He did not slight the message, for he both is come, and is lodging here next door, with his host, a friend of his father’s, a nice old man. He, too, gives every assistance to his guest in his amour, and encourages and seconds us with his help and his advice. Therefore, here <stage>(pointing to the CAPTAIN’S house)</stage>, in-doors, I have found a grand contrivance, by which to cause these lovers, each, to meet the other. For one room, which the Captain gave to his mistress for no one but herself to set foot in, in that same room I have dug a hole through the party-wall, in order that there may secretly be an ingress for the damsel from the one house to the other. And this I have done with the knowledge of the old gentleman; ’twas he that gave the advice. But my fellow-servant, whom the Captain has given as a keeper to his mistress, is a person of no great worth.

And that you may not hereafter make mistakes, this damsel to-day, in this house and in that, will perform in turn a double part, and will be the same, but will pretend to be another, person.

How he does so is somewhat of a mystery to the Commentators. Thornton, in his translation, suggests that he calls through the window, where it is natural to imagine that Philocomasium might be stationed within hearing to observe all that passed. He could hardly, however, call <q type="emph">through</q> the window of the ground floor, as these were generally more than six feet from the ground; and, indeed, there were rarely any windows at all on the basement. It is most likely that Philocomasium is hidden behind the <foreign xml:lang="lat">clatri</foreign>or <q type="gloss">lattice</q> of the window in her room on the first-floor, whence she observes all that passes. In a future line we find Acroteleutium and Milphidippa owning that they had been watching from the window what was going on outside. Schmieder thinks that the whole plan having been prearranged between Periplecomenus and Philocomasium, he merely on this occasion makes a sign to her, the meaning of which is here expressed in words, and he supposes, what it does not deem necessary to suppose, that his servants have been ordered to delay Sceledrus, so as to give time to the damsel to pass through into his house.</note>! pass instantly, with all speed, into my house; ’tis absolutely necessary.

<l n="637"> I’ll show you more amiability on my part than I’ll make mention of <gap reason="lost"/> that you may have instances for proving it at home, and not have to seek it out of doors. For unless one has loved himself, with difficulty he sees into the feelings of one in love. But I have some little love and moisture in my body still, and not yet am I dried up for the pursuits of merriment and pleasure. Either the merry banterer likewise, or the agreable boon-companion will I be; no interrupter of another am I at a feast. I bear in mind how properly to keep myself from proving disagreable to my fellow-guests; and how to take a due share with my conversation, and to be silent as well in my turn, when the discourse belongs to another. Far from being a spitter or hawker am I, far from being a dirty-nosed old fellow, too. And never do I take liberties with any person’s mistress when out in company; I don’t snatch up the dainty bits before another, nor take the cup before my turn; nor, through wine, do dissensions ever arise on my account at the convivial board. If there is any one there that is disagreable, I go off home; I cut the parley short. Stretched at my ease, I devote myself to pleasure, love, and mirth.

Where a husband divorced his wife, the wife’s <foreign xml:lang="lat">dos</foreign>, or marriage-portion, was in general restored to her; and the same was the case where the divorce took place by mutual consent. This will account for Acroteleutium asserting that she had been divorced from Periplecomenus, and that she had retained possession of the house as having formed her marriage-portion. As a loss of affection on either side was thought to constitute a good ground for divorce, is is not to be wondered at if the Captain should believe the story that his neighbour’s wife had obtained a divorce on account of her passion for himself.</note> my present marriage, longing for a match with him.</l></sp>
