                <p> PYRRHUS crossed into Sicily. <reg>when</reg> , amongst other prodigies, the
                    statue of Jupiter in the Capitol had been thrown down by a thunderbolt, its head
                    was discovered by haruspices. <name>The</name> consul Curius Dentatus, on
                    holding a levy, was the first to sell the goods of any man who did not answer
                    the summons; he likewise defeated Pyrrhus, who had returned from Sicily into
                    Italy, and drove him out of Italy. <name>The</name> censor Fabricius removed
                    Publius Cornelius Rufinus, an exâ€”consul, from the senate, because he had in his
                    possession ten pounds of wrought silver. <reg>when</reg> the censors had closed
                    the lustrum, there were found to be 271,224 citizens. <name>An</name> alliance
                    was made with Ptolemy, king of Egypt. <reg>sextilia</reg> , a Vestal Virgin, was
                    found guilty of unchastity and was buried alive. <name>The</name> colonies of
                    Posidonia and Cosa were established. <reg>a</reg> fleet of the Carthaginians
                    came to the assistance of the Tarentines, an act which constituted a violation
                    of the treaty. <name>The</name> book also contains successful wars with the
                    Lucanians, the Bruttians, and the Samnites, and the death of King Pyrrhus. </p>
